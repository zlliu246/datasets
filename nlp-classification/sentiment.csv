sentiment,review
0, Think Dallas - the dream: I think this author got tired of writing the story and decided to end it in a quick bizarre way. I was warned about the bizarre ending but I read the book through to the last page and was astounded by how she ended the story. It's the first book I've read by this author and it will be the last. I don't always ask for a happy ending but this ending left me feeling I wasted my time reading the book. It was very unsatisfactory.
1, Great Condition: I ordered this book as gift for my mom and was a bit skepticalbecause I saw that it was only $ 0.01. I thought when it arrived it wouldlook used. I am glad to say it looks brand new. I am very satisfied.
1, smells great: purchased this for my father for christmas and he loves the scent. its not easy to find scented powder and he was very happy with this one.
0," Horrible horrible horrible CAT REACTION!!!: Tried cat attract and awoke this morning to find cat litter and feces all over 3 rooms. The cats must have thought it was cat nip because they threw this stuff everywhere!!! I am not exaggerating. This was a nightmare and when I called the company, the only redress they would provide is refund if I provide the receipt. I expect to be reimbursed for having to sterilize my floors.Please do not buy this product unless you have your cat(s) confined to a small enclosed space.Just a nightmare."
0," DOG TRAINING FOR SADISTS: We bought this book at the recommendation of the manager of a local pet shop -- it was the only book they carried.The training methods found in this book are abominable and were undoubtedly stolen from Hitler's private files. For example, the author suggests that if your dog nibbles plants, stuff his/her mouth full of greenery and tie it shut, then chain the dog so he/she can't move.And it gets worse. So if you love your dog, avoid this book at all costs!"
1," Praise for Lewis!: C.S. Lewis's On Stories is one of the most insightful little books I've ever read on literature. His ""Fairy Stories"" is worth the price of the book. If you want to understand literature as well as good authors' use of it, buy this book and listen to everything Lewis says."
1," Difficult to read.. but well written.: This by far has to be one of the most difficult books ive attempted to read, and i to no extent mean the words more so the topics touched in this story. the only thing pushing me to finish it is hope that some sort of justice is served in the plot. The fact that a 40 year old deprives a 12 year old girl of her innocence will at most times in the book leave you in disgust and feeling disturbed. But credit be given where its due, the author is a genius and some would say a madman himself to be able to tell this story of a mad man. I do admire that with the touchy subjects that he wrote on he never used any sort of vulgar vocabulary to describe certain scenes. in my opinion its a mentally strenuous book to jump into because of the monster who is telling his story but the author hit it dead on, minus some parts which i think get very repetitive. take what you can from this story, which is hard to with a closed mind, and then move on."
1," More basic than earlier seasons, but in some ways more realistic.: Our family is a fan of all the seasons. This one is slightly less complex in interpersonal complexity, but the plot execution is generally more relistic. I always have a hard time with those episodes with faking people out with masks - hokey. There are a few here but not many. A large amount of organized crime plots, versus earlier international often third world villians.... we kind of miss those."
0," a disappointed fan: I guess my problem is I keep waiting for another effort on par with LAZER GUIDED MELODIES, which is one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately for me, each release of J.Spaceman's gets farther and farther away from my desire. For all the pomp and hype, like the album's warning ""Prepare to be blown away,"" you'd think LET IT COME DOWN would be a bit more trancendant. I find it boring, and almost tedious at times. Many of the tracks have an almost childish rhythm to them which quickly grows painful.I think it's sad that the best track on the disc is the SPACEMEN 3 cover of ""Lord Can You Hear Me?""I could probably like this disc more if I forced myself to, but I shouldn't have to. It should just be better."
0," Sophisticatedly stupid: Ok, first of all, this book is illogical, to be more specific, totally illogical, and historically, the worst book I've ever read. However, the beginning of the story is quite fine, but not till the middle and the end. The ending is too predictable, too uncouth and in every respect, disgusting. I hence, proclaim once again that this book, though enhanced by wondrous, beautiful prose, is flawed by the illogical, and abrupt storyline."
1," Excellent!: This is certainly an excellent CD both in concept and performance.The idea of collecting violin transcriptions of Chopin's pieces is wonderful (and original, too, I believe). These beautiful pieces are transcribed by the greatest musical minds and played caringly by Manoukian and Eguchi. Manoukian's tone is crisp yet sweet. The Cello sonata sounds like it was really intended for the Violin. Please also note the tasteful performance of two Nocturnes transcribed by Sarasate. The notes written by Manoukian are also very enjoyable."
0," Much too firm.: I had high expectations for this pillow. I tried it for one month, and each morning my neck felt worse."
1, what sequels are made of: Many people for get this movie actually exsits but this is my fav rocky movie of the saga if you don't like the boxing match watch it for the story alot people will say rocky 1 but i haven't seen it enough this really set the bar in sequels in my view
0, Interesting thesis but ultimately incorrect: This is ultimately an unsatisfactory book. Feiler does little scholarly research and depends mostly on personal encounters. His thesis that Abraham is claimed as the father of three great religions is incorrect. Feiler tries to account for 4000 years of history in a book of a few hundred pages. As a result much history is oversimplified.For a more detailed discussion of this book go to seniornet.org and look at the book discussion section.
0, It is not a textbook: Like all Timoshenko's books it is not a textbook. It is a collection of solved problems. This book does not provide the general vision of elasticity -one of the most beautiful physical theories.
1, Works: This was a convenient way to cart my son around the airport. It was pretty easy to detach and reattach as needed.
1," Pure Genius: When i first listened to this album I really didn't like Marty Friedman's style. I put the album aside and left it for a while. A few months later I went and got Dragon Kiss and really thought it was brilliant and Friedman's style came through there. So I got True Obsession and put it on and absolutely loved it. It provides a good mix of guitar instrumentals and lyricized stuff with some beasty, 'Marty Friendman' style solos. Fave track off the album 'Hands Of Time'. Definitely a great album for any Friedman fans and some people looking to be introduced to his stuff."
1," Sweet Gloves: I bought an 80 lb everlast heavy bag and needed some gloves. Most gloves are the big hard to tie ones. I saw these mixed martial art gloves and read a few reviews. Well I ordered them. And I'm so glad I did. Easy to get on, has Velcro wrist wraps and the open fingers are crazy good. They are so fun to wear and don't get hot at all and did I mention the leather. I leave the wrap straps hang sometimes while hitting the bag for added cool effect. All in all. If your looking for a great pair of gloves and don't want to look like some rote-looking old boxer, then do yourself a favor and buy these puppies. You'll be glad you read my review when you do."
1," Even mediocre Roddenberry is good fun: Very good much, this is 2 of 4 attempts by Roddenberry to take similar material change it, and create a series, it didn't take until much later with the series Andromeda. This story is fun, and it is clearly a product of the 70's and is a very interesting response to ""women's lib."" John Saxon is great as always,"
0," Barely worth reading, if at all!: I thought that this was the worst book I have read in a while. While true the Malkavian are hard to figure out and understand, did the book have to be page after page of gibberish? You have to fight to even care what is in this book in the hopes that it makes sence later. It doesnt... Other than a few, VERY few parts that are even understandable it was not worth the paper it was printed on. Oh yea, and those few parts... they dealt with non-Malkavian topics.I read this book hoping to get someting for the series out of it, but if you skipped it, you would not miss anything. I think that the idea that to be Malkavian, you had to write pages that could not be understood was a terrible idea.This is tragic considering how much I LOVED every other book in the series!"
1," A year in the life of an ESL Student: I like this book that it has a lot of idiom and expression.but,it is not easy to me,because I came to US on one year ago.I will read this book again and again."
1," Fighting Against the Odds: She has no father to speak of. Her mother, who works hard but gets nowhere, is skilled at trying to be in charge, but not at being close or understanding. Her older teenage sister, who does pretty much as she pleases, turns into an unwed mother. Only her little sister is close to her.Carol doesn't particularly like her town or her school or herself, but you'll find her open and honest and her story very moving.[Realistic fiction suitable for junior high to high school.]The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
0," KONG FAIL: It lasted about an hour: Okay KONG is known for creating some pretty tough, ready to take wear and tear items.This is not one of them.I was looking for a plush like toy my 20 lb dog could play with...they say there's not that much stuffing in it. KONG did not have to pick it up from all over the apt.Said brown bear was stripped and gutted in about an hour.Skip this one."
1, Great headphones Especially for the price!: I was looking for some new headphones b/c the factory ones broke and I found these and for only like $14-$15 I got these they are great! Great sound! Reduces noise as it says.
1," Great album,Very welldone: I love this album because there are so many great songs(in my opinion all of them.) The songs that I like listening to the most are Everywhere,Goodbye to you and All you wanted. I think Michelle is going to have a bright future if she continues and I think she will.Michelle Branch most be one of the best Pop artists."
0, Overrated: Too much hype and overrated. There's nothing else I could say about this movie. Just rent it if you really want to see it. Don't buy it!!
0, Very Dissatified: Bought this to replace an older DVD writer. Easy setup and worked fine for about 3 days. Then problems started. First there were numerous write errors. Then the write speed declined from 4x to 1x or slower. It took 82 minutes to write a 2 GB folder. Then while writing another file it died altogether. No lights were on and it would not open leaving the disk inside. I won't buy a Pacific Digital product again.
0," Could have been a much better ""Haunting"": Blech!!!Let's not mince words here. What could have been a really strong and truly frightening film, because it was based on historical truth, was not to be realized. How many times can one watch the exact same things going on in a film until you turn it off? I don't know, because I was foolish enough to watch to the most ridiculous end!Two stars- because the cinematography saved this film from the bottom. No recommendation in the least."
0," JUNK: I bought one of these for Christmas, after a week it started skipping. fortunately Amazon extended their return policy and I returned it. Unfortunately, I bought another.... AND IT""S DOING THE SAME @*"
0," hoping for the best: im not sure if this will work for me i just put in my order today and i will keep yall posted,Today im on cycle day 3 of AF and i will be taking these pill as soon as AF stop BABY DUST to all :)"
0," High hopes dashed: I had been searching for a quality work glove with ""feel"" for years, thought I found it in these gloves. I was unfortunately let down. Great gloves, great ""feel"", wore out in less than a month."
0," Lightweight - not worth the cost!: This book is more like a ""Win 2000 for Dummies"" book than the in-depth reference I had hoped for. For example, as an example of a ""catastrophic failure"" the author refers to a mouse failure during boot-up. There is little depth to the text, and critical issues such as modem sharing and the like are not even covered. NOT RECOMMENDED."
0," Product did not work for me: I was unable to get a good spine decompression with this product. I am a tall man (6'6""), and I do not think the device works well for tall people. If you are average height, you may have better luck with this product."
0," Very Biased: I was hoping for an even-handed book on the death penalty. Unfortunately this was not it. Eevery defendent is either innocent or railroaded according to the authors. The offenders were made out to be wonderful guys who simply had a bad day. They were either innocent or didn't get a fair trial....the usual liberal arguments. I had little sympathy for the convicts ""counting down the time""The victims got no mercy and neither should these guys."
0," Where is the REAL Cornwell?: I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years and have watched her writing decline in her most recent books, even the Scarpetta books. But I was not prepared for this book. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it. The intended humor wasn't even humorous to me; rather, it was tiresome. I didn't care for the characters nor for what happened to them. Thank heavens I got the book from the library and didn't waste a dime on it! Don't waste your time or money on this new Cornwell."
0," Underdeveloped Main Character Numerous Mispellings and Punctuations: This book is disappointing. The writer is a gifted storyteller but the typos, run on sentences, and punctuation errors were a huge turn off. The summary is misleading in that one of the main characters, the slave Reinert, is severely underdeveloped. Is this on purpose? Also, the supposed friendship between Reinert and Bart is a joke. With friends like Bart, who needs enemies. Do not read this book if you are looking for a well balanced account of both races during the civil war era. This book leans heavily on the racist sentiments running rampant during that period of American history."
0, Dissappointed: We purchased these to communicate with my nephews who just hiked the rim to rim at the grand canyon...while I' was not expecting to talk to them at the bottom of the canyon they did not work even at the rim until we were practically in shouting distance. This was a major dissappointement.
1," I love this pump...: This pump has work great for me. I don't have any sore breasts and pump plenty of milk. The only thing I don't like is the attachment for the storage cups. The cups don't screw tight and one time while at work the cup came loose and all the milk fell on me...not a good thing...I got a avent bottle and use with the pump now, better..."
0," On/Off Button in terrible location: this little trimmer could be a five star, but poor design places the on off switch in the worst possible place, and anyone that has used these can testify that it gets very frustrating having to turn your trimmer back on because you accidentally keep hitting the on / off button...too bad..."
0," Won't play in our DVD Players!: It only plays on one of our 4 DVD players! Very irritating. We love snow white, but sucks that it only works on one player"
1," What A Bargain!: Why pay more in those fancy cooking stores and sites for a pizza or bread stone when you can get a nice and thick high quality stone for much less.This is the one to get, and if you've been looking around for one, you know that the price can't be beat!"
1, Awsome Story: This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel. I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments. I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!
1," If this isn't heaven...: No matter what people may say about her, she can make music!! That's my opinion! Substitute for love: An ok slower song. The video is great! Swim: Really cool! She can express herself! Ray of Light: I get this goooood feeling when I listen to this one!Genious! Candy...: Annoying, maybe? But good, ofcourse Skin: Just good!! Nothing really matters: Look at no. 3 Sky fits heaven:I wish I made that song!!!! Really Shanti...: What's the point?? Interesting?! Frozen: Aaahhh... delicious.. cold..more The power of good-bye: I make such good pictures in my head when I hear it. To have and not to hold: The best since... ever Little star:: I love it!! Nothing less! mer girl: beautiful....This is definetely the best album ever!! You better buy it! It's worth it!! Swear!!"
0," Ms: I have not received the workbook yet, its been more than one month... Please see to the matter, My college is yelling at me everyday."
1," Loved it!: Great story - a book you can pick up, put down, and then return. Trying to get my teenage sons to read it!"
1, Very Good Phone: Had the Motorola before. Piece of junk. Went back to the old reliable Panasonic. Always excellent quality for the money. This phone is no exception.
0," Whirlpool Microwave: [ASIN:B000GZ2GO2 Whirlpool Gold Series GH5184XPS 1.8 Cu. Ft. Over the Range Microwave Oven with 1100 Cooking Watts & Instant Defrost: Stainless Steel]] I purchased this Whirlpool Microwave 2 years ago and it has seen light use during this period. My wife gets home late at night and I use hood lights to dimly illuminate the kitchen. Just recently I awoke to find this Whirlpool Microwave completely dead. No power, no clock, nothing. The bulbs in the hood lighting look as though they became extremely hot before burning out. The ceramic fuse was burnt, too, the main inverter board. Again, this occured when the microwave wasn't being used, when I was asleep. I contacted Whirlpool who refuses to do anything. To repair it will cost $400+ dollars. So I guess I will be buying a new microwave; definitely 'not' any Whirlpool item."
1," Project saver: This book along with Teri Masaschi's book saved a 3 month project. Bob's is technical and Teri's is ""how to"" so they compliment each other. Get both. If you have never finished a large expensive project before, this is mandatory reading. My first piece was a queen bed, Stickley style, out of cherry. Thanks to them it turned out beautiful."
1," Perfect: Expensive, I thought. I'll pass. For a week. But you know how it is. Once you've got it in your head, you can't let it go. Finally, I bought it. (Well, it was hard to get, but I have friends who can get me things from the US).And I love it!The two new classes, the prestige classes... the powers, monsters, and psionic items--you could start an entirely new campaign based only on psionics! Especially with the way they've allowed the psion to follow any of six paths. I prefer the telepath, but the shaper is cool, too.Give it a shot, I did, and I don't regret it."
1," Unmitigated Listening Pleasure: Quoting from the liner notes: ""Gamelan Pacifica is a professional ensemble in residence at the Cornish College of Arts in Seattle. Inspired by the gong/chime orchestras of Java and Bali (collectively known as gamelan), the ensemble performs new and innovative music in an international style ..."" To my western ears, traditional gamelan music is enjoyable, but a little goes a long way. Trance Gong contains music that has more stylistic and sonic variety than traditional gamelan, however, and the net result is an hour of unmitigated pleasure for the listener."
1," Now I can see...: I installed these on my 1996 Toyota 4runner, which has normal halogen headlights.... not HID not Xenon and not projectors... I had a hard time seeing the road and the berms, especially after the plows have scraped off all the lines. These lights really light up the near road and cast a wide beam. Installation was actually fairly easy and everything is included. I mounted mine on the top of my bumper (the bottom would have been my first choice, but there was not enough 'lip' for drilling). These lights work as advertised and are great for my old eyes. Oh, I just hooked them up to a simple switch... working independently of either the high or low beams."
0, Ugly green towel: Based on the reviews and the picture color for Chartreuse Green that's what I ordered. What I received was a dull medium green towel - so ugly a green that i don't know what to compare it to. It wasn't that thick and I have less expensive towels that are a lot softer. This must be either a knock off or 2nd because it's just plain ugly - and I normally love all shades of green. Would have sent it back just too much trouble. Beware that colors in the pictures may be WAY off.
1," 4 starts - good: This is a good one when it comes to time, temperature, and time projection 4 feet to the wall in darkness for sleeping.it done a great job setting day light saving automatic change , and also great job every mid night contacting the atomic clock to keep every second of the time accurate. The projector done a good job of display time and temperature.The LCD doesn't light up blue. The AC power is a little bit hard to remove some time ( too deep in) , that is not a big deal."
1," Title song not my favorite, but rest of album good.: The title song is trite... but the rest of the album has one great piece of music after another. Better than average.JP"
1, Great job: This was a very good book and a must read for anyone who likes the truth and want to understand the world that we live in.
1," Yurt Craft 101, The best starting point.: I have been building Mongolian type yurts for about ten years. I have a library of texts and photos but Paul King's book is one that I constantly return to both as a text and as a simple reminder of why I love the simple thought of this dwelling. Paul has been able to distill the apparent simple design into a plan that will allow most to understand the construction and assembly of a mobile Mongolan home. The plans will allow any one to grow into more elaborate and larger structures should you have the ambition. This is the book that I recommend to anyone looking to build or understand yurt craft."
1," You MUST buy this CD: I had my computer on Spinner.com and I heard this voice, and checked and it was Gillian Welch. I had never heard of her, but immediately jumped to amazon.com and ordered the CD. It arrived about a week ago and I can't stop listening to it. All originals by Welch and her partner David Rawlings, it is one of the best CD's I have bought in years. The music is so sweet and rich it makes me want to cry every time I put it on."
1," Brings back fond memories.: I saw this particular line-up of ASIA in, of all places, Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the Yucatan Liquor Stand. It was in December 1992, almost a month after this show was recorded at the T & C. The recording, although not the best, is better than most of the live stuff I've heard from the ""bootleg"" series of ASIA CDs. Steve Howe was touring with them and as with this show, he didn't come on until later. Me and my friend (both of us YES fans) marveled at the fact that we were not more than 15 feet away from Steve Howe, and most of the ""kids"" in the place didn't even know who he was! While the reviews for this CD are typically mixed, I would recommend it for anyone who happened to catch them during the 92/93 tour. ""Little Rich Boy"" is a particular favorite, which at the time was played live but not available on the domestic release of AQUA."
0," Maybe it's just me, but....: ....I could not get into any of these stories. I don't like reading something and having no idea what is going on.There seemed to be a lot of words, but no action.Disappointed in this book."
1," Laughs'n'Love: For once the USAmericans have succeeded in making a movie in which the subject of homosexuality is nearly treated as something normal. Basicly, though, this gay thing is only an excuse to make a love comedy. The excuse does not really work - but the comedy does!"
1," Good, But Not Great: Having purchased Darwin Wiggett books before, I had a certain level of expectation. While this volume contains many *good* photos, overall it doesn't attain to the same height asDarwin Wiggett Photographs Canada. It also is not as well printed as Photographs Canada, which BTW, has a different publisher from Dances With Light (and apparently from all of his other books as well). Is DWL a nice coffee table book? Decidedly yes. But if you're looking for something really special, a true art book, try his Photographs Canada."
0," DVD quit after 3 months: I have the 26"" model and I've watched two DVD in the 4 months that I've owned the TV. The DVD player is not working. I bought a refurb and it started acting up right after the warranty ended. The television has a great picture and works fine and has alot of features. Save the money and buy a model without the DVD player. I wish I read these reviews prior to buying it."
0, Not good for scratch removal: I bought this product because I read a review from a couple of people that it was able to take scratches from stainless steel appliances. I was not successful in my attempt. I imagine it is good for what it was designed for though.
0," Poor quality DVD: Fine movie, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I already owned the VHS version of this movie and it was one of my kids' favorites. I bought the DVD to take advantage of the better sound and to get the widescreen format. Unfortunately, the quality of the print or the equipment used for the DVD transfer was awful. During the climactic scene where the lovers confront the bishop, there is visible dirt that shows up as a dark mark on the bishop's vestments. When I tried to clean my TV screen, I discovered the ""dirt"" was part of the DVD. Although the kids don't seem to mind, it drives me crazy."
1," MOVING SIMPLICITY: With a singular voice to watch, Amy Jo Wood explores her own journey of grief in this deceptive collection of short stories/character sketches/memoirs. Truth literally exudes from each word, and you are transported to a different place and time. The characters explored become real to you, most particularly the author's own voice, which is alternately joyful, passionate, sad, but always insightful and charming. You feel the need to walk these paths yourself to wash in the transcendental footsteps Ms. Wood has luckily left behind."
0," Warning - Description on Amazon.com is vague: Can't attest to the quality of the product, but the description on amazon.com is vague - I was very careful to match the reader to my vehicle (or so I thought) and STILL had to send this back and order a different unit for my '03 Ford with an OBDII system. amazon, as always, was great: gave me an electronic credit so I was able to order the correct unit and get it coming before I even shipped the original back."
1," Nice and strong!: If you are reading this review, rest assured that I spent way too much time researching cough drops and this is most likely the best option in the category (it was #1 for me!).They are much stronger than halls or anything else I've tried and actually seem to suppress a cough. As an added bonus, they last along time because you only want to use them when you really need them. Don't buy them if you are looking for a candy type cough drop, they are not sweet and don't taste that great. They will help with a cough and will clear your sinuses."
1," the Black costume..: here we have the spider-man 3 ""symbiote"" spidey figure..its a well sculpted figure with a cool suction web. the black suit looks stealthy and stylish .i have to say, toy biz did a much better job with the spider -man merchandise. the quality was better , then again as a collector i wouldnt even open these.. but,i wouldnt give these to little Johnny though..he might break it.i see why hasbro wanted to get the spidey license along with the star wars saga .. they now have the rights to 2 of the most successful series ever, theres nothing like a monopoly.lets hope for spider-man 4 they step up the quality .. but ill give hasbro props they did a good job for their first time with spider-man"
1," SWEET!: this is an awesome dvd, for its production and sound quality. but really those elements are secondary to just how awesome this band really is. I don't own many ""LIVE"" anything, becuase most of it is total crap. here we have an obvious exception."
0," Sucks: This pedal is total waste of money. I recommend Taye double bass it's cheap and unbelievably durable!!!! Or some more expensive pedals: Iron Cobra, DW, Pearl. I had a single Ddrum pedal it was good and pretty cheap."
0," great toy, but did not hold up: My husband and I bought this toy for our 21 month old daughter. She adored it. After 1 week the ear quit functioning so we returned it and got another one. That one lasted longer, but not much after a month the ear, purple hand, and yellow foot stopped working.. My husband performed surgery on the puppy and found that the wires came unsoddered ( excuse my spelling) from the reciever this lead to the malfunction.. It is a great toy, my daughter absolutely loved it, but unless it is fixed and the quality of workmanship is increased, I would not reccomend this toy to anyone. Too bad really!"
0," Small and weak: Small, weak, hard to fill, very cheap thin, not good period. do do do do do do do do do do dod od"
1," Interesting and Easy Read-Good Information: I read this book in little less than a week. It is written very well and the author uses actual cases from his practice to illustrate the behavioral problems and solutions he suggests, which not only makes it fun to read the book but makes it easier to relate to your own pets. He does use a lot of pharmalogical solutions, but he always tries to fix the problem without first or get the cat off the meds as soon as possible. I have an agressive dominant cat and a feuding pair and am currently trying his suggestions on fixing the problem. Actually from what the author explained about serotonin increasing drugs I found a natural amino acid that would do the same thing without ""drugging"" my cat. Anyways, overall great read, kind of Chicken Soup for the Soul kind of read, much recommended. Fun to read."
1," A must for all Bonzo fans and fans of English humor.: Not all the the material is excellent, but there is enough here that is truly bizarre, wonderful, anarchistic, clever, witty, silly, and over the top to repay any listener. If you haven't heard of the Bonzos then maybe the History of the Bonzos will do, but if you have then the Cornology is an excellent collection. It also includes some solo contributions from the various band members, specially from Vivian Stanshall, that are not found on regular Bonzo albums."
0," Not good with long-haired pets: This vacuum has lost of great features, but I was disappointed to discover that it's not good for people with long-haired pets. My dog's hair clogs the hose and the canister and it's a pain to get out. Don't get this vacuum if you have a pet with long hair!"
0," Disappointing: This DVD arrived yesterday and I am an avid Film buff and a teacher of Film studies on the high school level. The presentation was dry and boring and the information was minimal. I was disappointed after I viewed it and the ""bonus material"" was stringent at best."
1," Back From Hell Steals The Show: Back From Hell is simply the best movie that I have ever seen, from the amazing acting to the great special effects this movie is a direct hit. If you've got any sense you will buy this movie. Otherwise you'll be mad at yourself for the rest of your life."
1, Good soundtrack!!!... don't skip it!: A soundtrack with amazing tracks that goes from folk to ambient-rock. I'm a HUGE fan of Sigur Rós and Radiohead... and their presence gives a strong feeling in this soundtrack. Bob Dylan's voice sounds gothic and dark. Chemical Brothers gives the beats that makes want to dance and Paul McCartney singing the main theme?!.... IT'S AN AWESOME SOUNDTRACK.... I truly recommend it!
0," All Duds - except one that had 3 lines!: I've always used name/store brand pregnancy tests, but after finding these thought it would be great to be able to get so many so cheap! I was extremely disappointed! All except 1 were duds not even showing a faint line, and some with a control line so faint I could hardly see it.Except for one single test that showed 3 lines!! Yes 3 and anyone who has ever used a pregnancy test knows they are supposed to only have a pregnancy line & a control line - this test had what seemed to be 2 perfectly formed pregnancy lines and one slightly darker control line. Neat I must say, but still why did all the others say negative when only one said positive?? I took at least 8 more after the 3 line test with all negatives....Needless to say I will go back to the brands I trust for future use."
0," 1,000 pages of sales pitch!: Paula Begoun's books have in the past been somewhat informative, but her latest edition is a waste of money. The reviews have not been updated, (there are a lot of products listed that are no longer made or have been reformulated) and the whole thing comes off as a sales pitch for her new line of cosmetics! She's just trying to sell that now on top of just selling her books, a bad combination! The reviews have the feel of ""this is why my products are better than theirs."" Taking the advice of Paula Begoun is now no different than asking Clinique what they think of Lancome! (except they would probably be more tactful!)"
0," Terrible: This product was useless. Once I filled the chamber, level or not, it leaked. When I hit the trigger nothing happened. The little wand in the gun moved but never blew any bubbles just dripped all over the floor. Tried to use the bubbles without the gun and just used a regular bubble wand and that still didn't work. Terrible product. Waist of money. Would never recommend this to anyone!!!!"
0," PROOFREAD!: Just to echo the thoughts of the perceptive reviewers above: please God, never let me screw up as much as David Martin has in this book."
1," Best of Slayers: I honestly believe this is the best of all Slayers BGM soundtracks. This is the music that most reminds me of the series and, I believe, is even used in Slayers Try in some places. I completely conveys the emotions at the end of the series, from some comedy, to sheer doom, to loss and, eventually, a happy ending. All in all, this is easily my favorite of the Slayers soundtracks. Highly recommended for any fan of the series."
0," Razor Review: I am not impressed with this razor. It is fine for thinning back my goatee and moustache, but it does a lousy job of trimming the line on my moustache. The one positive I can mention is that it holds a charge for a long time and isn't as noisy as other trimmers I've had. I would not recommend this to anyone - I prbably should have returned it but I used it and waited too long."
1," Best yet!: Without a doubt, ""Back In Black"" is the best in the A-List series so far. While I was disappointed in ""Tall, Cool One,"" this made up for it!The entire book is full of action, comedy, and terrific character descriptions--making it have an awesome plot. It held my interest the entire time and is my new favorite in this series.In the fifth book, readers get to 'see' Cyn, Scott Spencer, and a new character, Brock. The drama around these three, Cammie, Anna, Sam, Adam, Parker, and Ben (thank God for him!) is incredible.Absolutely perfect!"
0, surface peeling: I have used this griddle for about a year. The surface is now blistering and peeling. I am going to return it directly to the manufacturer and hope that the new one is better performing.
1," 100 Ways to Motivate Yourself: Change your life forever: From the first chapter, this book really drew me in and has given me so much encouragement and information. This guy is brilliant and doesn't over-word things until your bored. Very practical but extremely insightful and helpful. I'm ordering another one for my sister. This is a must read. Thank you Steve Chandler."
1," J-14: I am subscribed to J-14 and it is one of my favorites. My favorite parts of it are the hair section, page 50, and the lyrics page."
0," What a Boring Story...: Each time I opend this book, I had the earge to close my eyes and fall a sleep. I can't stand when men are portraid as door mats and that's what I thought about Adair MacTaran. He has NO head on his shoulders.Whatever. Never again am I reading anything by Margaret Moore!"
0," If I read the word chap one more time....: What a stinker. This book had only a few scant good parts and all the rest were well, not good parts. The parts with Susannah and her litany of personalities just wore me down. I don't want to spend 300 pages in someone's head. The Gunslinger and Eddie had some nice scenes, but that was it. You can't skip this book either, although you could probably skim over it. I will read book 7, I've come this far, but if it reads like this one, it will be tough to get through."
1," Great Buy!!!: Read reviews from others and selected these speakers. I made an excellent choice! I have these hanging outside facing the back yard, they sound awesome and have great bass response as well. Whether you're listening to a baseball game or jamming to your favorite music, you can't go wrong with these speakers! Everyone that has listened to them applaud them!"
1," Magnetic paper dolls: Basically, I like them, but they are a bit heavy. I wish they were vinyl like I recall from childhood."
1," Somebody finally got it right!: A few months ago I went searching for a decent boombox or small sound system for my home office. I couldn't find anything I really liked and settled on a midsize boombox. After a week I was so disgusted that I returned it (sorry, Sony - the tuner was that bad!). I tried this system out in the store and was extremely pleased. It tunes in all the stations I want and then some. The tuner has a great auto station preset feature. The sound is excellent for the size - actually very enjoyable. It doesn't sound 'cheap'. It has good bass and treble (both separate and adjustable). The MUTE button is great to have when the phone rings. A readable backlit display, intelligently designed remote, 3-CD changer (1 gets old fast), tape player and other bells and whistles round out the system. It's beautiful too. All I can say is 'Way to go, Philips!'"
1," One of the best thrillers I've read in a long time: As a great fan of British mysteries, i.e. Rankin, Robinson, James,etc., I was recommended Lost. This is a fantastic read! Intelligentwriting, wonderful twists and turns, and just an all-around wellthought-out thriller. Highly recommend it!"
0," scout/ohaus sclaes: Our school has purchased a number of these scales. None of them have lasted more than 2 years. They are poorly built, and lack any sort of reasonable durability."
1," This is Way Cool: Love this to death. Well worth the money - it's small, compact and easy to use. High ""wow"" factor when pulling out this gadget in front of your friends. Fun to take pics of yourself with friends. I am glad I bought this!"
1," Better than Strap Locks!: I am very glad that I bought this.It is easy to put on.It is difficult to get off, but that's the point!And once you get use to it, it's not so bad.I have had it for months now and I have done various demanding gigs with it. It holds up to everything and I actually feel safer then I do with strap locks."
1, Midland wr300 weather radio: With weather getting more unpredictable every year this radio is must have item in every home. I do recommend this product.
0," What a disappointment: I anxiouslly awaited the realese of Palahniuk's sixth novel, after being enchanted by the first five I expected the same for Diary, well it didn't happen. I never thought I would say this about Chuck Palahniuk's work, but this was awful. It went nowhere for about three quarters of the novel, it seemed like I was rereading the same chapter for 200+ pages. There were no characters in the book that were remotely interesting, nor did I care what happened to them. There isn't much to sumarise because there isn't enough context to eleborate on whats written in the dust-jacket. I'm hoping that his next novel makes up for Diary. To fans of Palahniuk, I'd wait for the paper-back."
1," voltaire: Tis, homers humble opinion that philosophy, Is the greatest thing in the world. It provides us with food for the mind, we can gain nourishment from it for life. And with an abundance of philosophers to pick from we are left with numerous options. Voltaire, is one of those uniquely gifted philosophers we owe it to ourselves, to read."
1," Loved it!: This was a great read, it really captures the struggles teens may face. It takes you back to high school to your own wallflower days."
0," A little out of date: Vancouver is a beautiful city to visit and the people are very nice. I was disappointed that this book was so outdated even the train fare is no longer $1.50. With so many tourist going to Vancouver LP might consider updating this guide more often.And this book list ""Hasting and Main st."" as being a shady area, they should have been more informative and wrote ""traveler should not walk pass these streets.""Description for places where too brief, lacked detail."

1," All the Help, All the Answers: Edith Beer gives all the answers in clear writing. Help is here for the teenager and for parents concerned about friends' children. This is a caring book with lots of practical help. Beer has authored other books about substance abuse and knows her subject well."
1, Nice shoes: Have enjoyed these shoes. Fit true to size. Great condition. Comfortable to wear. Really good price. Would buy again. Thanks.
1," Challenging Problems in Geometry: ""Challenging Problems in Geometry"" is exactly that - presenting problems in plane geometry with detailed answers. In addition to the problems the book offers ""challenges"" to the reader, which may be viewed as tangent topics to the problems. It is clearly written and with instructive diagrams."
0," Psychology for the Christian? Not Really.: This book sets out to present psychology through the eyes of faith. However, I found the book dissappointing. In fact, it quite uncritically accepts a rather steep picture of human nature from social and cognitive psychology and then goes on to pepper them up with a few bible quotes. Even free will is challenged. Now, that would be legitimate, but interestingly enough, even in mainstream psychology many of the findings Myers offers as the last truth are challenged (e.g. compare David Funder's research and Myer's stand on the bias-and-heuristics-programme). All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. It is short, uninteresting and its title offers more than the book offers."
0," Not what I expect from Bosch Evolution Series: I ordered several of these and have owned several Bosch Evolutions but both of these have huge lines in the middle. I have tried cleaning them and made sure the windshield is spotless, but in the rain I have lines in the wipe pattern. I have purchased Bosch Evolutions before, and have never had this issue in the time this happened. I bought them in October and put them on in late November... We have not even had ice yet, so why would this happen?"
1, The Best Star Trek of the Star Trek Scores: The choice to have Dennis McCarthy compose the music for the first Next Generation Movie was an obvious one. He had done so much of the Music for the show that he really deserved to do the music for the movie. He did such a great job I think its a shame that he hasen't been brough back to do any music for any of the other films. I Highly recommend this soundtrack for any fan of Star Trek or just good music.
0, Avoid this turkey.: You know it is bad when it is released on DVD like 9 weeks after it is released in theaters! Talk about huge turn-around.This film is based on the Firefly TV show which failed miserably on network television. So some genius decides to make it into a feature length film with a huge budget and guess what... the film also fails miserably! Did the dingleberries not learn their lesson the first go-around?The part that is really frightening is the rabid fanbase who acted like a pack of lunatic hyenas trying to get people to see this. It seemed like the word subtle was not in their vocabulary and the end result was it kept even more people away.
0," Waste of time: This game is a waste of your time and money. Unchallenging, illogical and a complete let-down. If you are expecting anything close to the success of Myst or Riven, do not bother."
0," Dated. See the remake!: This movie is dated. Unless you are a fan of classic horror movies, I do not recommend this one. I saw the remake before I saw the original, and the original is just not up to par.. The acting is laughable and very superficial sounding(probably due to age). Also, there are alot of things that happen that are unexplained in this movie. I don't know that I would have recognized them if not for seeing the remake, though. And why oh why is Ambassador Thorne in such a hurry at the end of this movie?! He wasn't being chased in the beginning!.. This movie lacks any sort of scare factor. And has lost all suspense over time.If you want to see an outdated classic horror film, this is the movie for you.If you are looking to see a scary movie, watch the remake."
1," Quality: I bought these as gym shorts for my daughter and they've held up beautifully. She loves them and wants a few more, even just to wear around the house. The size does run a tad small so for my 10 yr old, I purchased both the youth large and adult small thinking that she'd grow into the adult size. However, she could already wear both sizes when we received them at the beginning of the school year (she was in a size 12 girls' jean). That said, I'll be buying a few more in the very near future (probably a few mediums)."

There was quite a change in the texture after washing. They became very rough and not silky and smooth as I expected from a 600-thread-count product. I will not order again or recommend."
1," A little confused . . . Don't make the same mistake: I got one of these batteries with my camera. I made the mistake and thought it was rechargible. This is not a rechargible battery, it does have a long battery life, I brought it on 4 trips with me before it died. The problem with this battery is that it does not leave you with a lot of warning that it is going to die. The battery light flashes and the camera cuts off. Best to always pack a spare as you have no way of checking how much battery is left.Do not leave the battery in the camera when and if you use the docking station as I have heard it will drain the battery."

0," The title should be 'Understanding Fuel Injection': I have read this book thoroughly. Although it gave me a great understanding of how TPI works, it doesn't address any of the problems you WILL run into when converting your earlier model Chevy, like my 84 ElCamino. The 50 page troubleshooting guide seems to be straight out of the GM manual. The remaining 80 some pages talk about the specific functions of the individual TPI components and their relation to each other: very comprehensive. Just don't expect any help on 'swapping' TPI to your specific vehicle."

1," A must before planning!!!!: I am planning my trip for the summer with kids ages 5 & 7. This book is an absolute essential. I am even thinking of extending my trip a day or two.

1, Hepatitis C cook book. Yummy for the tummy: I hear alot about hep c but never what is good to eat if you are living with this disease. This cook book was informative with very easy to make meals. Format was easy to follow. Good meals that were easy and not expensive.I think it is a cook book that everyone could use. I am also diabetic and most of the meals were very good for that as well. The meals were also not blah:(. Tasted great {:.Tops up to this book. The cook book was great price to. If you are concerned about the disease or have other ailments this book is for you. The rest of my family liked the food so that was even better. One and only comment that is not favorable is not enough low cal desserts. That is why 4 outta 5.

0, Don't waste you money.: Bought these because they were supposed to be molded or custom-fitted to our vehicle. The edges by the door didn't form to the floor and stuck up. No way to use them because you would constantly hang foot on them when getting in vehicle.
1," Halloween Movie suggestions: I prchased this paticular CD from Amozon for my Mother. She is Not A "" Freddy Meets Jason"" kind of girl. LOL She loves the old slapstic comedy from her day.

0, Another guest artist CD that falls flat: Other than John Lee Hooker's efforts that combine superstar guest artists; there are very few CDs that successfully make this combination work. And Buddy Guy's effort isn't one of them. The duets or combination songs just simply fall flat and are strangely uninspiring. Give this one a miss and save your money.
0," Worst shipping and doesn't answer emails,buy from another seller!: I was in hurricane Sandy in NY and specifically asked in 4 separate emails to please hurry as I will even pay for expedited ship if needed.They answered one out of 5 emails and swore it would be in my hands 4 days from when I emailed.It took almost 2 weeks! By that time every store in NY had D cell batteries in stock,I was in a bad situation yet every other company shipped on time except these people.I have written many reviews and this is my first complaint out of hundreds of purchases online.That in itself says it all.Batteries were ok,they are batteries,not too much to mess up but non existent email answers and slow poke shipping is why I will stay away and you should think if you need batteries fast,look elsewhere!"
1," Good Music, but NOT Happy Hardcore: I love this cd. The title is misleading, however. There are only a few happy songs on it. The style of music leans more towards trance than HH. If you are really looking for HAPPY hardcore, check out the ""Happy 2b Hardcore"" series. The music on this cd is good, but should be labled differently."
0," What Became of Alinsky's Dedication?: In the original edition, this book is dedicated to Lucifer (as in the devil). Apparently the dedication has now been deleted. I make nothing of Alinsky's silly homage to the ""first rebel""; but it is interesting how the media, utterly incurious about Obama's years as a ""community organizer"" in the Alinsky mode, has overlooked any detail about the influences on Obama's career that might hurt him politically. I read this book in my liberal youth and remember thinking even then that the author is far more interested in overturning a social order he dislikes than actually helping the poor."
0," Stalker Faye Kellerman: I was disappointed in this book. Having read ""Jupiter.s bones""I found little of the same tension and exitement in ""The Stalker"".Cindy was a boring character.I'm glad I bought my book throughyour Auction.Sincerely, Ellen from Camas, Wa."
0," disappointed: I own Baby Bach, Shakespeare, Doolittle, and Van Gogh and my 15-month-old has always loved them. This video is VERY DIFFERENT. It is not of the quality that Einstein video owners have come to expect. There is a lot of blurry animation and the host, a creepy animated clown, leaves me feeling cold. My son, who is usually mesmerized by the videos, did not even look over. Maybe this has something to do with Disney buying the company, but I don't recognize it. I'm truly disappointed because after personally having to view my other tapes hundreds of times, I still enjoyed them. The other videos are wonderful - simple, clever, playful, and use real objects, children, and classical music. Newton is not well-made and a true disappointment."
1," A good mystery for dog lovers: This is the second mystery thriller of Todd Borg in his Owen McKenna series. Owen, a former police officer turned P.I., is hired to investigate a fatal forest fire set by an arsonist in the Tahoe National Forest. As the story progresses, more fires are started and more people are killed. Owen's Great Dane, Spot, and a search-and-rescue German shepherd named Natasha help unearth clues in this mystery. Owen becomes desperate to identify and stop the arsonist when his girlfriend is kidnapped and in danger of being a victim in the next fire.Tahoe Blowup is a good mystery with factual information on a variety of topics, including search-and-rescue dogs and their reactions to finds, the positive/negative environmental impact of extinguishing forest fires, entomology, art, and the terrain of the High Sierras.I enjoyed reading Tahoe Blowup, and I even learned quite a few things in the process. I received a complimentary copy in exchange for this review."
1," Good product: Suncoat is a good water-based product. I like other brands better because Suncoat can be a little thick, but for the price it is worth it. (The other brands can cost twice as much or more.)"
0," Good Faeries Versus Evil Daemons: It's already been mentioned, but the only thoughtful way to read this book is in conjunction with David M. Jacobs' ""The Threat,"" which interviews abducteees just as credulously and comes to opposite, terrifying conclusions about the motives of Alien visitors. What's really going on here is the War of the Mad Gurus: which seer will sucessfully sell his vision of the unknown among us? Too bad the WWF doesn't have a category for Battlin' UFO Academics."

1," Amazing blues collection - highly recommended: This is one of the finest collections of women blues singers ever made... And one of the first! The ever-fab Rosetta record label issued several pioneering reissues that examined the role of women artists in blues, jazz and R&B. This is one of their finest releases, with a dozen+ classic vintage blues tunes from the 1920s, '30s and '40s. Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue music reviews)"
1," Works very well: This fit inside the PC housing well. It is much, much louder than the original fan but don't mind it much."
0," Don't bother: This book was barely able to hold my interest, and in fact I did not bother to finish it. Too much narrative; too much ""tell"" rather than ""show""; too many aimless, unnecessary tangents; weak characterization, etc. This silly, glorified travelogue would have been a better story had it been more concise and 150 pages shorter. I don't know what Tan was thinking when she wrote it."
1," Hose Washers: Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know."
0," Where the Red Fern Grows: I ordered the dvd and, upon receving it, played it on my dvd player. There was a flaw in the disc, and the movie stopped playing when the flaw was reached. I contacted Amazon, and they promptly sent me a replacement. On playing the second dvd, it had the same flaw and stopped in exactly the same place. I have kept the dvd and skip over the flaw (about one minute of the movie)just before I get to the problem. I believe the problem will probably pop up on future copies so I decided to work around the flaw rather go through the hassle with a third copy.I'm a school teacher and needed to play the movie after reading the book. I'm just going to explain the problem to my students when I show it."
1," Love this!: I love this saucer! My 5 month old son loves it too. The only problem I had with it was putting the legs together, but my hubby took care of that part. As for the dye issue, the flower toy on my sons saucer also left pink on a paper towel...I found an easy fix. Use a screwdriver to take the toy apart, and suspend the flower (only the cloth flower! Not the whole toy) in some hot water with detergent. Let it soak for a little while and all the extra dye runs out of it. Rinse, let it dry and viola! Problem solved. I put the flower back together and my son is enjoying banging it on the book. This saucer is great and I would recommend it to anyone. I have free time now and that is invaluble!"

0, 80% the author hates the US vs. 20% information about living in Mexico: I can't post anything here that hasn't been said in one of the many one star reviews already posted. The author is more concerned with focusing on the negative aspects of the US to the point where he losses focus on what the majority of readers will purchased the book for - helpful information on deciding whether to move to Mexico or not and how to live there if they do move.Anyone who is considering moving to Mexico probably already has reasons for thinking of living outside the US. His effort would have been better spent explaining the pros and cons of Mexico itself or the ins and outs of how to get things done there. Even an objective comparison between the US and Mexico with the emphasis on how some of the conveniences Americans are used to are not available would be acceptable.This is just an overdone anti-US editorial.
0," Lovely concept, poor execution: The concept of lycanthropy as a metaphor for sexual initiation is an interesting one, full of implications to keep a graduate student writing for days on end. Unfortunately, this film fails to adapt the concept smoothly, and its jarring visuals (really, could we not find even a couple of wolves for shooting, instead of using Belgian sheepdogs?!) undermine its attempts at real art.In the end, I couldn't decide if the confused scripting was a comment on the conflicting and tangled mythology of sex presented to most adolescents, or if it were simply a conflicting and tangled screenplay. In the end, it failed to move me.With its intriguing premise, it should have been better than it was."
0," Repetitious Babble Leads to Lousy Ending: I was eager to get into this book, my first Clegg. The story started fast and then slowly fizzled out to nothing but repetitive psycho babble, an unbelievably weak protagonist, PG sex scenes and a lost storyline. I ignored the typos and amateurish formatting, thinking the story would get better. It didn't. The ending was nothing short of ridiculous. Did Mr. Clegg grow weary of this novel and say to himself, ""Oh, I've got a great idea for this one; let's overuse deus ex machina and leave the readers scratching their heads muttering, ""What the ...?"" My own fault, really. I usually read a sampling of reviews - the good, the bad and the indifferent before deciding to buy. I didn't on this one, sold as I was on the description and sample read. I won't make that mistake again."
0," Chinese hater's delight: Don't really find any insight about the Chinese people as a whole. Jasper simply observed and added his own prejudice to it.For example, ""When I spoke to the peasants of Zizhou, the villagers had just returned from a performance by a travelling opera troupe who had set up a temporary stage on the only patch of flat ground in the narrow valley. As we talked we could hear the high-pitched voices and the clash of cymbals as the troupe played out another tale... The ritualized performance, and the peasants' delight in it, spoke of history's powerful and oftern merciless grip on the minds of so many in China.""Sounds like he think only Europeans are capable of enjoying the music and the artistry of an opera performance. Chinese people enjoying Chinese opera proves ""[Chinese] history's powerful and often merciless grip on the minds of so many in China."" What kind of analysis/insight is this?"

1," Make Your Flying Deductible: As a pilot (SEL, gliders, hang gliders and paragliders) and a skydiver (D-454), I love this book. We need more books on flying and this book will show you how. My first book took eight years (The Parachute Manual, 590 pages, 8.5 x 11, 2,000 illustrations) off and on (mostly off) as I wrote a column for Parachutist magazine. That book gave me my start. My next book was the first book on hang gliding and it did so well I was able to move back to California and buy a home in Santa Barbara. Today, many of my books are still on aviation.This book reveals how to research, write, edit, typeset, finance, print, price, promote, market and sell your book. Best of all, it is specific to aviation books. Chevy Alden has done an excellent job. Now you can write about what you love to do, get paid for it and deduct your expenses.

0," So dissapointed and wet: The umbrella feels sturdy and opens with a force. No problems closing. On closer inspection I notice the stem part feels kinda flimsy. So I'm standing in line waiting for this place to open up in the rain with my new umbrella, when all of a sudden a gale of wind rain comes blowing, and it flips this umbrella inside out. I was so pissed. The wind was not that strong. In fact the other people in line who had regular umbrellas had no problem. The problem is with the wind release on top of the umbrella. The wind release skirt is on too tight, and unable to perform its wind release function. Another problem is that its too small, my sleeves and sides were getting wet. If your like me,average height and extra large, your gonna end up getting wet."
0," Room One: Longtime Clements reader and I have to say, this book is just horrible. It's completely lacking all of the charm we have come to know and love from all of his other books, and I don't understand where that disappeared to. Before you say, well, maybe you're just too old for the books now, I'd just like to say that I still read Frindle and the School Story and others, and they're still as good as when I first read them, if not better.There's almost no character interaction or character development. It's simply boring.The cultural references also threw me off, they're supposed to be timeless stories, not stories with iPods and Gameboys and wars in Iraq. They should be happening to anyone, anywhere.I just didn't like the tone. It's nothing like his old works. If you're a fan of the classic Clements books, I strongly recommend you spare yourself a few minutes and pick another Andrew Clements book to read, cause this one's just not worth it."
1," Love it!!!: I got this for my son when he was 6 months. The first few times he didn't know what to do in there but after the 3rd time, he was having a blast jumping around. It keeps him entertain for about 30 minutes. Highly recommend this product."
0, Carafe broke: After only 3 months of use the carafe exploded at night when it was empty and sitting in the coffee maker which was off.
0," Looks great, fell apart first wash!: I really wanted to like these green apple kitchen towels. They're very attractive and Calphalon brand, and I particularly liked the green. They were absorbent too. BUT, after the first wash they absolutely fell apart. The seams gave way and I washed them per manufacturer's instructions! They were ruined after 1 gentle wash.Thankfully the store took them back, no problem. For $7 a towel you expect better!"
0, Death Stick - D160 DOTIC: On 18 May I bought a 14oz. titainum death stick. It has been less than a month and the waffles on the head are worn out. There is a big nick in the claw between the forks. It should be at least 18oz. The handle feels good. I will be taking this hammer back for a refund.
0, Not Plus size: This item does not run true to size. It's says PLUS size but looks more like a large ! Material was as stated but size was way off!
1," Noein: Noein was an interesting anime series but not as erudite as one would think with a series that has elements of Quantum theory , multiple universes and the like - still an entertaining series though .=)"
1, bruder trash bin set: so excited when ordered them. the 2 bins that came with the truck were just never enough. my son who is 2.6yrs loves the different colour.different colour different rubbish.Its great for his fine motor skills. He now has 10 bins in total!!!..more would be great.. the big ones are not so easy to put onto the truck but wont take him long..If you have a bruder truck than we recommend them...keeps them busy for hours..
0," If Ed Wood had made documentaries ...: IF the Earth is being visited by aliens, and IF the government has been working hard to cover it up, then this sometimes amusingly incompetent ""documentary"" was probably made by government agents to further the discrediting of anyone claiming to have had an encounter. A seemingly endless stream of talking heads tells us over and over again that IT'S A FACT!!! while the filmmakers throw in a bunch of incredibly cheap and shoddy computer generated ""simulations"" of UFOs and alien encounters. By the end of the show (if you can stick with it) you'll be absolutely convinced that the whole subject is a hoax and only sad, deluded people could possibly believe there's ""life out there""."
0," A so-so read: This was the first Hillerman novel I ever read.How it ever became a best seller amazes me! Fortunately it was the only book I had with me on vacation, or I would never have gotten through it. About halfway through, however, things did improve.Hillerman does a good job of evoking the flavor of the Southwest and the story is interesting enough. But, I made the mistake of reading this immediately after having read Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" which is a much more engaging and entertaining book.Based on my experience I doubt that I'll read another of Hillerman's works."
0," Vita-Prep 3 broken 15 months later: My Vita-Prep 3 broken after 15 months doing the same heavy Acai smothies I make daily. I guess I used the machine a lot and pushed it, but I'm not doing anything different. I guess it does wear out so be aware. To repair it will be almost $200 with shipping + labor and parts they say are normal wear and tear (e.g... the rubber base also became loose). Anyway, I loved it until this week. I thought I had bought a tank. Not the case."
1," You'll think twice before breaking the law: The great ""Banned From Television"" series continues with this 4th installment. This time all of the footage is inside prison walls, you will see a murder, deadly riots, hostage situations on prison ground, and much more! Unfortunatley this video has not yet been released on DVD format, if you would like it to be please sign the ""Banned From Television: The Prison Files"" petition by logging on to www.petitiononline.com/BILLYF (CAPS LOCK MUST BE ON WHEN TYPING ""BILLYF"")"
0," An OK shoe stand: Having purchased the Winsome Wood foldable kitchen cart (which I like and feel was worth what I spent), I was quite disappointed in the quality of this shoe rack. It seems sturdy enough, but not nearly as attractive as the picture, and not worth $40. Even with the lack of instructions, it would not have been terribly difficult to assemble if it had not been missing pieces. The bag with the wooden dowels and the screws for the connectors (for stacking one on top of another) was missing - I hope to have those pieces in 2-4 weeks. Hopefully the wobbliness of the shelves will disappear once the correct sized dowels are in place - I am improvising temporarily because, yes, I am going to keep it for lack of a better option.Also, this shelf will not hold 19 adult shoes - at most 15 when using the floor space underneath.Edit: I did receive the missing parts in about 2 weeks, and it is sturdier now."
1," Great book, Great author: I don't think DV knows how to write a dud book. In his typical style, this book is a great source for all things induction related. This book is great for someone who has little knowledge on the subject, as it clearly explains all the fundamentals. It is also just as valuable for the more experienced engine builder/racer as it contains loads of info on carb mods, manifold design and mods, mixtures, atomization, etc. It also dispells many myths that do nothing except slow you down. Rather than writing books based on popular and expert opinions, DV's books are based on hard scientific fact. He does the work, and he has the results. Knowledge is horsepower! With DV's books, I've never gone wrong. On a horsepower per dollar basis, his books are the best investment you'll ever make."
1," I read it so many time I heard the cadence in my sleep: My daughter loved this book when she was young and I grew to dread it. She loved the rhyming and always chanted the closing, ""Feet. Feet. Feet. Oh, how many feet you meet!"" with me. I read it so many times some evenings that I would lie in bed with the equivalent of the tune going through my head. Nevertheless, the pain of repetition was more than salved by the joy on her face as she listened to me recite some of her favorite rhymes."
1," So you're interested in history... or maybe you teach?: If you have read on the Reformation or are interested in Western Civilization, to know it or to teach it, this book is a must-read. The articles collected offer terrific insight to this critical period of history. You will get insight from authors challenging the concepts of reformation/counter reformation, to ideas as diverse as the misogyny of the era, among many other ideas. the hardback is [money], so look for the paper back."
1," works very well.: I have gone through many staple guns, not because they wore out, but because they always seem to jam or not drive the staple in all the was. This one works very well. Although it does misfire occasionally."
1," Tai Chi Music: I was looking for suitable music to use when doing Tai Chi. I found this cd to be just what I was looking for. It is very easy to listen to, and is very relaxing. We are now using some of the tracks during our Tai Chi class. I would recommend it to anyone who is searching for peaceful music, which is suitable to accompany Tai Chi practice."
0, Lousy: The sound and recording quality was terrible. RCA does not make a good recorder. Sony makes a good one. The RCA recording was nearly inaudible.
0, d-sink mat: Wouldn't recommend. The coating comes off and the steel rusts. This occured in the first year we had it. Now searching for a new one.
1," Season 1 Fringe, Entertaining: I didn't start watching Fringe after the first season was released on dvd. I was so impressed with the show that I bought the season for my father who is in Afghanistan. He loved it!"
0," Is this comedy or what?: Sorry guys, I respect everyone's opinions, but this stuff sound laughable to me. I never thought epic metal was really appealing, since I doubt electric guitars mix well with medieval atmospheres. But I do think people like Ronnie James Dio were wise enough to keep the music somewhat on a different level than what it tried to represent. Imagery is one thing, being a parody is somewhat different. This CD sounds like a group that's actually trying to make fun of epic metal. Unless you're into this stuff (being it COMPLETE devotion to the most cartoon-like wannabe Superhero Knights) I recommend to avoid this like the plague."
1," A Perfect Fifth!: A musical kettle of the highest quality.When the water is boiling it whistles F# and B.A gentle reminder that it is time for coffee or tea;and I have bought three:One for daughter, for brother and one for me :-)"
0," Mediocre: A big step down from ""On"". In fact, there is only real two ""good"" songs on it. At its worst it sounds like Night Ranger or Billy Squier."
0," This book is a hoax but the issue is real: This book is now considered a hoax. You can do an internet search to comfirm this but here's one: www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1268957,00.htmlI was suspicious of the book when I saw her on Cspan. I lived and worked as a journalist in Jordan and knew her discussion of the number of honor kills was too high by a factor of 10-100 times (she claims thousands per year in a country the size of New Jersey, the actual number is at most two dozen per year). But now the brave Jordanian journalist, Rana Husseini, who actually did risk her life to bring this issue to the fore in Jordan has come out definitively against the book's veracity. Does Amazon have a responsibility to make note of this? I think the booksellers at least should caution on the book description that it is now widely considered to be a fake. The author grew up in Chicago, not Jordan, and this particular case of honor killing does not exist in the record books according to Husseini."
1," skimpy quantity: this is a good item, but the quantity of refill pages is pretty skimpy. This is typical, but it's hard to tell online when you can't see the package. just be aware that one package of refills won't hold that many pictures."
1," The Comas....GREAT band!: I have been following The Comas for quite a long time, and I consider them one of the best new bands out there anywhere. The new ""Spells"" CD is their best work yet. Look for great things from this band!"
1," I love this book: I watched the PBS version on TV and enjoyed learning about the relationship Hutto formed with wild turkeys and wanted to learn more so I put the book on my Wish List and received it as a gift.It's tender, touching, informative, poetic and lovely.I bond with animals of all kinds, including domestic chickens and can appreciate the experiences of cross-species bonding as outlined in this book.Love it, love it, love it."
0," Gotta disagree ....: I loved his first two novels (and could not be bothered to even read the ""boyfriend within"" thing). Anyway, I was hoping for a lot more. This is well witten, but just does not seem to go anywhere."
0," Good Laptop, Horrible Heatsink: Let me start by saying this laptop is blazing fast. 10ghz cuts through processes like a hot knife through butter. And the 30 terabyte hard drive... I can fit the entire Library of Congress on this thing.There's just one shortfall with this laptop. The heatsink on this thing isn't adequate whatsoever. I set my laptop on the couch and it burned straight through to the floor. Advice to Viewsonic, look into a cryogenic coolant system for the 10gig processor. A cheap piece of aluminum and a fan just ain't gonna cut it."
0, cheap product at high price: This is an ordinary block of old fashion soap would never order again. Product could be bought anywhere that sells homemade soaps for $2 or less. Hardly any fragrance to it - would best be used on camping trip in an emergency to wash clothes.
0," cd player stopped reading discs: I purchased in Sept 05 and have enjoyed it for 1.5 years -- but suddenly it stopped reading cds. I put the cd into it and close the lid and the screen reads ""no disc."" I called sony and they offered to exchange it for the special price of $77.60 -- which is the same price I paid/or I could re-buy it for today. Big bummer. I was expecting a much longer life..."
0, Junk: The toaster part of this product never worked and the egg poacher worked about 3 times...fortunately for me the seller sold two and neither one worked so he refunded my money without me having to return the product.
1," Quick and Easy: My cat's hair is not especially long, but very dense. This year he shed far more than ever before. This comb gets the loose hair off quickly, so that I can give him a good once over before he starts to squirm. Certainly helps the carpets stay cleaner, and maybe lessens the hairballs, too."
1," works well enough: Our dog has major allergies and ends up with chronic ear infections. We have taken her to the vet many times to help control this, but she is allergic to many pollens, dusts, and certain foods. We have used Zymox in the past with good success and this works about the same - though the ""apple"" smell isn't very pleasing - would rather no scent."
1, Why did it take him so long to write a book...???: This book was put together very well. The apple definately didnt fall far from the tree. This is Lil Donald really representing for it to be his first novel. Keep up the good work Patrick.
0," This was my first experience with a Kiss ...: This was my first experience with a Kiss My Face product, and I have to admit I was disappointed. This was the worst smelling lotion I've ever encountered. I tried it the first day it arrived and thought maybe it was just me that didn't appreciate the patchouli/hemp oil combo so I invited my mom to try some. Her response was the same as mine: """"Ick, smells horrible."""" Sure, the lotion softened my skin, but I wouldn't be able to use something that had such an unpleasant smell."
0, horrible: the tines that actually do the chopping bent all out of place after only a couple uses. I wonder if the other models that are similar in appearance would hold up any better?
0, Stopped working after 7 months: I bought this toaster 7 months ago. Recently one side no longer heats up.
0, no performance: After attaching the cable properly to my HP Laserjet 5P andmy new Dell Vostro PC the cable worked for several days andthen stopped working.
1," Man you talkin' about crunk...: Lecrae lays it down! And it's still Gospel, but with a beat. He truly has a message worth listening."
0, Replacement Battery for Uniden Phones: I did not realize I was one size off in getting the proper replacement battery size. Now I am stuck trying to sell 4 batteries that I can not use.I promised never to own Uniden products again in this life time.
0," Too crispy, too big and too many: I bought a case of these to make some desserts. I had no idea I would get so many in each 7 oz. package, or that they would be so big, or that they would be so crunchy. Taste is fine. Just know that if you're making a dessert and you expect the ladyfingers to suck up the sauce or sherry or liqueur, buy more sauce/sherry/liqueur than you planned!"
0, Highly Disappointed!: I guess it is somewhat my fault but I thought that this was an actual camera with a built in viewer! The title should be changed to camera viewer! I was trying to purchase this quickly so my husband didn't see me (it was a Christmas present).
0," Great performer, poor recording: It's obvious that Primrose is an awesome, *awesome* violist from this CD. Unfortunately, the poor recording taints the listener's experience with gritty, grainy background noise. It could be a result of the age of the recordings this CD's tracks were taken off of, but even so I felt myself taken away from really enjoying the music. If you have an honest desire to hear Primrose perform, then this CD is for you; otherwise, don't waste your money."
0," Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can't.: I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
0, grinder: I couldnt get the grinder put together . there were sparse directions and it would not fit together.two other people tried to put it togeher and couldnt
0," He wasn't even tryin' in the first place...: This whole ""gangsta rap"" craze is a major disgrace. As much as I hate Eminem, at least his lyrics sometimes mean something. 50's don't mean nothin'. Okay, you're gangsta, we understand, we've had this whole ""I'm a Gangsta"" thing shoved down our throats for the past decade, and frankly, it's CRAP. Gangsta rap is worthless - I wouldn't touch it."
1," Classroom use: I use this in my classroom every year. Create a graphic organizer before allowing students to write directly on the poster. Parents love it, and students enjoy telling about themselves.It was also a few dollars less than Scholastic's price."
1, Seemed to help: My wife is a plastics intern who purchased this book. She used this to study and felt good about the exam after taking it so I would recommend it.
0," Yuck: This is a very cheap book, I'm surprised and dismayed that my professor is using it. It was copyrighted in 2001 and contains weird and outdated information. It is an extremely simple read, and only good for someone opening their own home daycare. It gives a tiny bit of information on every topic from finances to speaking to parents, but is really only appropriate for someone without any higher education, and would be satisfied babysitting children out of their home.I paid 8$ for it and I'll be lucky if I can sell it to someone else for even 5$."
1," Sub: Great buy for a quality sub woofer, have recommended this product to another person and they are just as happy with it as well."
0," Not Much of An Overview..: This book didnt seem to cover Hinduism that much, more like the temples and the history of the Indian people...not much on the religion itself...Not my best pick, I'd say keep looking."
1," Outstanding piece of work: All the lyrics, and music in itself, is constructively emotional, deepening in love. I have owned this since 1990, and still in love with all of the songs. A must for those who reach for love."
0," Handle with care - wiring breaks easily: This product is loud and has several poorly soldered connections (2 of which broke trying to place in our fireplace).It is powerful enough to blow air throughout our downstairs and was worth the money, but if you don't have a soldering iron consider ordering one at the same time."
0," NO USB CABLE: I do not recommend that anyone purchase this printer. I did not get a USB cable with the printer so I called and was told they could not send me a USB cable that they had to send another printer. I was assured that they would check the contents to be sure it was included. I got the next printer again without the USB cable (the printer is useless without the cable to hook it up to the computer). Since I do not want to be shipping back multiple printers I gave up trying to get a USB cable sent to me. I had to go to Best Buy to purchase a USB cable to use this printer and it cost me $35.00, guess this is why they are missing from the boxes."
0," Good time passer: People stop reviewing this like a normal film. This is a classic B-movie to be watched when you don't have anything else to do. Leave it at that. I laugh at how seriously people review this movie. It accomplishes what it set out to do, provide a film full of scantily clad females. Maybe I should change my 2 stars to four based on that."
0, disappointed: The cover picture is the only one I like. The decorative style is far too primitive and junky for my taste.
1," Big Loud Ugly Power Trip.: Looking back on the whole era, there were about 30 grunge albums that were more popular than this one was. Most likely because this was released before the scene exploded. But when I think of my personal favorite, it's ""Louder Than Love"". More than ""Dirt"", ""Nevermind"", and ""Ten"", to me, this is the epitome of grunge. It's a little metal, a little punk, and big, loud, and meaty. Songs like ""Ugly Truth"" and ""Loud Love"" are just mindblowing, and ""Hands All Over"" doesn't just rock, but preaches environmental awareness. Not every track on here is a winner, but front to back it's awesome. At least 3 of these songs are on ""A-Sides"", their best of album."
0," Terrible Company and Product: Purchased a new GoVideo DVD Recorder + VCR model VR3930. The instructions for set-up were very confusing and it took many tries before setup was accomplished. While attempting to record off our Sony CamCord,the unit would tape for a certain length of time then would stop completely. Called their service dept and received no help solving problem. When recording DVD's off another DVD Player the 3930 would not play the DVD at times. Some DVD's it would play, others wouldn't. All the DVD's would play on our bedroom DVD player. (Which is not a GOVideo machine)The machine is not very reliable at all. Sometimes it will do what it is designed to do, other times it will not. Customer Service is not very helpful, and lets you know if your outside the 90 day warranty period, the machine is your responsibility. After dealing with this company, I definitely would not buy ANY product from them."
0," disappointed: I am very disappointed with the Jack juicer. I don't mind the cleaning and think its much easier to just hand wash instead of dishwasher, but my disappointment is in the pulp. I get alot of wet pulp most of the time. I thought there'd be less pulp and drier as the commercial claims. I'm concerned about all that wasted nutrition thats going into the trash instead of in my stomach. I'd love to ask him why he makes these claims about % more juice than other juicers et cetera. I like the juice and like that its fresh and without added sugar and all sorts but theres so much waste!"
1, Tea mate :): So I'm an excessive tea drinker... This thermos is perfect for my purposes!Pros:It keeps iced tea cold or hot tea hot for like 4 or 5 hours.34 ounces is the perfect amount of tea for a session.The cup on top keeps your hands warm if your office/home is cold because the steel heats up really fast with hot liquids.The base is small enough to fit in many cup holders.There aren't really any cons about this thermos. I would recommend not putting anything in it that may stick to the sides because the mouth isn't very wide and cleaning could be difficult.I brew yerba mate in a french press and can drink it all day long with this thermos! :)5/5 for sure! Very good build quality!
0," Great talent and voices wasted on bad music.: Roberto Alagna's presence in this production was the only reason I bought it. As usual, he was great. It is just too bad that he wasn't singing to something that sounded like music.I admit being an old coot way down in the chaparral country of Texas who just doesn't care much for opera written since Verdi, Puccini, or even Wagner. If you really like classical opera I think you might not like this production."
1," Wow! Hot creative sex!: Whew! Who knew Liz and Jack could have so much fun in a strip club! Nice romance, lots of steamy sex with plausible misunderstandings between our couple. Great buy at 4600 units."
0," Not up to par for Metheny: Look, if Pat Metheny is your religion, you'll like this album. I'm sure the music worked quite well in the movie. It's very atmospheric but it just doesn't do justice to a full CD. It's too long, there are sections that are mostly strings or synthesizers and very little Metheny. But if you like this, and even if you don't, you'll like the soundtrack of The Straight Story better. Lots of Metheny-like guitar, pastoral-like scenes and overall better melodies with much less aimless filler. If you insist on buying it, I suggest heavy editing to a cassette with The Straight Story on the reverse. Good for a quiet drive in the countryside."
0," OUT OF DATE: Please note, we at the Nonprofit Sector Research Fund have recently received several letters by students requesting applications and stating that they read about our program in this book. They are sent to an address that has not been in use for five years, for a program that no longer exists. Scholarships change, and this book is about eight years old--that makes it NOT a good resource. I am only giving it one star because that is the lowest option."
1," All I needed to know...: I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video."
1," Worth the Money!: the title speaks for itself-this DVD is worth the money! It says on the back that the running time is 2.5 hours, but there's a lot more than that on the DVD. It has songs live in Chicago, acoustic song versions, backstage stuff, 7 music videos, making-of stuff, and on and on and on. buy this- you're not just going to need 2.5 hours to finish the DVD."
0," Who listens to this stuff?: Ugh. That's all I have to say about the Bloodhound Gang and this incredibly juvenile ""Hooray for Boobies."" The name of the CD tells you whether or not you'll like the CD. If you're an immature and easily amused person with an shoe size higher than your IQ, chances are you'll love this CD. Fine with me - go listen to it. Just don't call it music. It's a perversion that this CD should be on the Billboard Music Charts, because this stuff isn't music, it's image on a disc. These guys make Blink 182 look like Bob Geldof. To anyone with a brain, it's obvious that this CD is aimed at nothing but selling records with an image of immature guys who sit around and drool over ""boobies"" all day long. It's great for a thirteen year old hormone ball of a boy, but this listener isn't interested."
0, It's difficult to get you rebate: They will make it very diffucult to get your rebate. They said my rebate is invalid. However I can reply their email. There is no phone number either. Big companies won't do these tricks.
0," A sparse overview: When I buy a book, I want a little depth. This book is a decent summary of the Flash backend, but it's nothing you can't readily find on the web. I HIGHLY recommend a more specific approach--e.g Foundation PHP for Flash by Webster ."
0, Don't buy from this vendor: This Product was advertised as if it were ready to use. I set it up and tried to use it but the paper feeder refused to feed the paper. I needed the Power Cord so I consider that I paid $40+ just to get the power cord. VERY DISAPPOINTED
1, First Rate: The visual presentation the book offers combined with the interactive CD-ROM make this indispensable to anyone who really wants to understand how option pricing works. It's right here on my desk for easy and quick reference - which is my advice to everyone!
1, Godzilla raids again: Movie did not disappoint. I've been a Godzilla fan most of my younger life. I seen Godzilla go through many make overs. Godzilla Raids Again.Don't sleep on this one all fans get out that plastic. Get yours today.
0," Great advertising, but, short on honesty: Were I to do it again, I would save myself several hundred dollars and insure the unit does not have the TV Guide BS. The hard drive recording sounds good, but what Panasonic does not tell you is: you MUST set up the TV Guide system, even if you do not have this feature, in order to use the manual timer recording; you will be without a television for 24 hours, if all your cable goes through a cable box while the recorder attempts to download the TV Guide; you can manually set up channels (although the set up guide gives poor instructions on doing this) but still not be able to timer record. It plays and records beautifully, but, I think better satisfaction could be had for less money."
1, Pleased with this purchase: I had a good experience with this purchase. I bought this for my daughter. She got it quick and I paid about $10 less for it than for the one we own that we bough a few years earlier. She said it works good was in new condition and is happy with the sharpener.
1," mmmz...ok: this game is pretty much only mini games.plus dha mini games sumtimes repeat and it's not challenging and very boring after a while.but it's kinda a good game if your lik,10 years old.but not for sumone lik me."
1," Da Best!: Wow, this is the best aid I have for the adnd game yet. It'slike a whole campaign setting in 1 book, and it is (worth the cost).The devils in it are awesome monsters. The lords of the layers are also very cool. I like the whole idea of it the best. The creators of this book made a VERY good book here."
0," The Planet Earth - Complete BBC Series (HD DVD): I was not aware when I purchased this item that we were required to have the capability of playing an HD DVD. I think you should make customers aware that there are different versions. I gave it as a gift to my husband, who opened it to watch it only to find out that we don't have the proper equipment. It was opened and beyond the 30 day period."
1," good product: Great product for both my and my husbands needs. We were doing some testing to see what is best for makeup and crafts. No real instructions, so we had to kind of wing it, but we are doing ok I think"
1," with Rubin's introduction: I ordered the edition with Louis Rubin's introduction, which is excellent and provides context for the essays in the book. Regarding the essays, some are very good and enlightening, while a few are obtuse. That is to be expected, as the authors address a variety of themes but I would recommend reading through them, as I did with, for example, Allen Tate's thoughts on religion, which were hard to follow in places but full of keen insights. In particular, I liked John Crowe Ransom's discussion of the ideology of Progress, which I think explains a lot of the inconsistencies and blunders of today's progressives. I have a business background, and graduated some decades ago, so for a while I haven't used some of the thought processes necessary to follow these essays. In my opinion, however, the book is useful for students of Southern history and culture as well as for anyone interested in reading a humane response to societal questions."
0," Not my cuppa tea: Philip Marsham signed on to work on a ship. Before he had traveled far, however, pirates on the ship kill the ship's captain and part of the crew and take the ship over. Philip has no choice but to stay on the ship and help the pirates, as much as he is able, to carry on with their plan to take over other ships. Finally Philip has an opportunity to escape from the ship onto an island, but he cannot survive long there. He finds another ship and has hope to convince the captain of this ship that he was not a willing member of the pirate crew and that he will be allowed to travel on the ship to home.It was all I could do to keep myself reading this book. ""Just a hundred more pages,"" I told myself. ""Keep on going. It's a Newbery and you have to read it if you are going to actually read all the Newbery winners."""
0," Skip this one.: This dog of a film suffers greatly from poor acting, fails to even remotely follow what REALLY happened, and contains an absolute muriad of continuity mistakes. Purists will be offended, while unfortunately most people will be enamured purely by the special effects - which are the only things that make this waste of film watchable"
1, Futsal Soccer Ball: I bought this ball for my granddaughter and she loves it. She says that the weight of the ball is perfect.
1," Brand New Rockin Hard: The BRANDNEW album Your+Favorite+Weapon is amazing! I urge everyone to go out and buy it because the band has their own unique sound that sets them apart from all other bands.When you hear them you can instantly say ""That's BRANDNEW and they freakin rock!""They have the type of music and songs you can listen to over and over again and never get sick of it. The whole album definetly is worth every penny and you can really feel the energy in every song they play!"
0, THIS SHOW OFF IS QUITE STALE REALLY: Me thinks that show off/ zero subsatnce books are an insult to the environment...We killed trees so this guy who used to work for commercial pop kerrap like R.I.P and that other phony 'hard music' mag that like evrything else this guys does went under can write books.
0," Nice features, low reliability: The rest of the reviewers have hit the features spot-on. However, having failed after likely less than 100GB of total transfer, this device has failed. It now no longer powers on in any computer and I have lost all data on the drive.For transporting data, it seems to be okay. Just be sure that you're not using it as a backup device or as the primary storage device."
0, Paper Chase: I did not receive this CD. I received the wrong CD and I never got the correct one. But my money was refunded.
1," Great but not the best.: I am a huge Pearl Jam Fan and own many of the bootlegs. This one is good, but not great. There are some sections where the band and Eddie just seem out of it, like ""Do the Evolution"". Eddie forgets his own song. Perhaps it is the wine talking...lol."
1," Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful! If you're driving, jogging, or even folding laundry, this audio narration is perfect for those times when you can't pick up the book and read for yourself."
0," What a piece of junk.: This thing stinks. I shave my head weekly with a trimmer, and my old one was on its last legs so I ordered this. It didn't even make it through one haircut. The blades jammed up. Not with hair, they just were stuck together or something. I greased it up with the little tube of lube it came with, no luck. I took it apart to see if there was hair in there but there wasn't. So after completely disassembling this thing and putting it back together I got it to work for another minute. Then it froze again.I had to dig my old clipper out of the trash to finish my haircut. I am returning this piece of junk."
0, Emperor's New Clothes: The author routinely makes the diagnosis of mood disorder with alarming frequency. This is a serious diagnosis and should only be given after a thorough understanding of the patient. There is no breakthrough in medical treatment here. A more unbiased view of case histories would be helpful.
0," Unsatisfied: I am engaged and preparing for my wedding, I thought that this book would be a fun read. I found that this book was extremely anti-climatic and there was absolutely no plot. I did laugh out loud several times while reading this book, but a more appropriate title would be Fat Bride turns Fat House Wife: A collection of super short stories. Another reviewer said that this book ""tried"" their nerves. I felt exactly the same, it was such a quick and easy read from the start but was such a struggle to finish."
1," Start with this one.: If you're new to the Hornblower series, start with this one. Then read Ship of the Line, then Flying Colors. The three are practically a triptych, whereas the others all feel like they have space between them. Also, since Forester actually wrote Beat To Quarters first, there's in 'introductory' quality to it that no other book in the series has. The series compares favorably with the Aubrey/Maturin series I think. Odd that they were both cut short by the deaths of their respective authors.In short, start with this and the next two as a trilogy, then proceed in any order you want."

She became a teacher and then wrote this book about her life.

1," This is a really terrific, masterful film!!: I have never been more impressed by a Native film! I am amazed this film did not receive more press! It is masterfully written, directed, and acted. The special effects and editing are skillful. This film seems to have captured the Native spirit and organic intelligence so oftem missed by more two dimensional productions. It's a must own!!"
1, Thank you!: I haven't had a moment to even pick up the book to read but I'm excited to get started! All this series of books are amazing!
0, DVD doesn't play: This Sony DVD didn't play after the title screen. I sent it back and got a replacement. It didn't play either. You would think Sony could make a DVD that works. What a waste of time and effort.
0," Have owned many grills, this is by far the WORST: We purchased this griddle because the plastic on our last two became brittle and split a leg off, rendering them useless. This griddle did not heat evenly (think: pancakes that strongly resembled black & white cookies). The heating element was so sensitive that it was either too cold at 200 degrees or causing the smoke detector to sound from the extreme heat at just a fraction of a turn above 200. Finally, after one dinner of tacos, a pancake breakfast and a half pound of bacon, the griddle was completely filthy and the burnt grime would not come off of the ""non-stick"" surface no matter what we tried. Thankfully Target accepted a return on the item and we went with a higher end model from a different manufacterer."
1, It was a great comic with great art.: It is about a sientist who once wrote a book about ants. He has built a robot alien. He has crashed on a planet full of aliens. I like this book because it is an action packed comic with great art and a good story.
0," Left Earphone Broke in 2 month: I didn't even use it very often, but my left earphone got broken after 2 months.I recommend purchasing better quality earphones."
1," Fabulous read!: This book made me laugh out loud, and it made me cry! You have to have experience as a military wife / girlfriend/ significant other to share Sarah's insight. I have recommended it to all my military spouses in our squadron and have even loaned it out!"
1," IT'S A MIRACLE!! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED!: I bought this book with quite a bit of hesitation and skepticism. I had tried to potty train our three year old in the past, but he had no problem wearing his diapers. But, preschool starts next month and all students have to be potty trained. I bought this book without much hope of it working, actually, but several of my friends knew people who had been successful with it. IT WORKED IN FOUR HOURS! If you follow the steps in the book exactly, you will be amazed. After four hours, my son was going to the potty on his own, without even telling us first. I can't believe it was this easy after all the times we tried. I'm sending the authors a big fat kiss . . ."
0," Violence breeds violence: Bleak account of how a violent childhood determines the life of small town cop Nick Nolte. Short on sentiment and a little slow, the film is, nevertheless, watchable and a reasonably effective indictment of child abuse. Nolte delivers a surpisingly intense performance and James Coburn oozes malice as his despicable father."
0," spineshank still sux: spineshank sux, and their album's become more crap too waste money on. self-destructive pattern isn't even worth a kazaa download, this band just sux."
1," Loved these characters: This is the first novel I read from this series and I loved it. I really enjoyed the two main characters and was pulling for them the whole time. She did a great job with Damien, my heart really went out to him for what he was suffering. I thought the main plot was a little forgotten/rushed but it didn't matter because I enjoyed their love story. I can't wait to read the others from this series."
1, Excellent book: I learnt a lot from this book and the one by Mayall. I strongly recommend you to purchase this if you are looking for technical details on sundial construction. My eagle eye picked up some spelling errors but none that were too serious.
0," Not Reliable Product: This was the second time I purchased a hard drive from this vendor and it was the second time it was defective. While I did get issued a refund in both instances, I would not order from this vendor again."
0, Leave it on the bookshelf!: I agree with some of the other reviewers for this book. The characters as well as the plot lack development. Too many unanswered questions. The ending left me thinking one thought: what was the point? Too many assumptions have to be made on the part of the reader and too many unanswered and unresolved issues. The writing was choppy and lacked flow. I would not recommend this book.
0," not what I was hoping for: I brought this book home certain that I was going to fall in love with it. I didn't.I found the characters difficult to like. I found the events from one generation to the next to be repetitive. I was annoyed by the right-left politics of the book. At the end, I found myself liking Esteban better than Alba.I wish I bought something else."
0," Hose burst after 1 week: Bought this hose from a retailer. Seemed like a great concept, but in practice it was harder to reel in than I had hoped; and after a few days the thing burst -- big 2-inch hole in the side. Don't waste your money."
0," A Mystic (scientist?): I have always wanted an interesting teacher that electrifies the science area. I despised the traditional old books that said nothing about the subject and added only dryness, just dryness. So, I looked at Feynman as a good excuse and tried it, why not? It's a very, very primitive basic review on the subject. Feynman segways more than he teaches, he drums more than he teaches. Saying very little of substance. More like a casual hang-out that has coffee and friends and drumming, sadly, I'm not a fan of any of that. I am now convinced that math and science should remain dry and to the point which is enough to give this terrible DVD 1 star out of 5."
0," Mind numbingly mindless: After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases."
0," Don't buy this: I have an epson 2200, in an attempt to save some money i bought these. installed a couple of the cartridges, and they don't work. After trying to clean my print heads and doing all the maintenance i could think of , they still don't work. A waist of money. Just buy the epson's I guess."
0," Do you want a little cheese with that whine?: Nora Ephron is getting older. So are we all. Getting older is generally viewed as better than the alternative. Yet Nora complains that she is just too wonderful to even bother to comb her own hair - but it's just soooo far down the block to her stylist - and what if it rains? Cry WAH-Wah-Wah all the way home.Manhattan matrons with little else to do but Lunch with the Ladies may be amused, but Ephron's purportedly funny stuff is so out-of-touch an affront to the majority of American women of this-certain-age as to be callous and nauseating. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
1," Bell Ultra-Tool Multi-Function Bike Tool: very good one, it was a surprise because i thouhg was only the keys but it got others things for your bike..really good"
0," Ringo: I have to say that i was disappointed by the poor variety of this album. I did not expect displays of enormous talent from the most limited of the 'fab four', but all the tracks are predictable and dull with very few redeemimg features. Only for the avid collector"
1," Good Value and Sound: I bought these for our little front garden/porch area - and they look very good nestled within the shrubs. They have a very full sound and can be turned up quite loud with little or no audible distortion - They don't have the thin tinny sound that many inexpensive speakers have - and the bass is pretty strong. I was actually surprised at how good they sounded. So were my neighbors. (They have ordered a pair) The only thing I don't like is the connection - which is a piece of cable with + and - leads coming out off the bottom of the speaker. You'll need to buy some wire nuts that can be buried for a good connection - I bought some at Lowe's. (if you plan on burying your cable to hide it.) Other than that - they work well.THREE YEARS LATERAfter one of the worst winters on record, these still sound as good as the day I installed them - after being left outside in bitter cold and getting buried under ice and snow. Really glad I bought them."

1," Excellent coverage of process engineering principles: I am a senior chemical process engineer, and I found this text an excellent reference and aid for keeping current on the broadbreath of information that comprises chemical process engineering."
0," Not what I was expecting: Nova really let me down on this one. This DVD tells us a lot of what we already knew from watching the news during that time. Other documentaries surrounding this event, such as the National Geographic one, introduced new information and explanations. If you've already seen the National Geographic one, don't bother with this one. It's a shame, too. I usually like Nova..."
1," happy with our purchase: Not really having the problems some of the other reviewers of this item are having. The replacement pads we got are identical to the ones that came with the toy. They lasted about a year and just now needed replacing. We flip ours over once the one side is destroyed. After that we replace them. Not sure why some customers are saying they are smaller and dont fit the track as well. We arent having this problem at all. Didnt even need to add catnip to the tracker. Our female cat likes the scratch pads while our male cat prefers playing with the track itself. They both sleep on the scratch pads. These are cardboard, so im not sure what some people expected to get when they ordered this. They are inexpensive and last along time. Cant complain. Would recommend them."
0, I would reconsider buying this printer: I'm very disappointed in this printer. I did not realize that it does not print a true black since it has only a color cartridge. It prints a dark green in place of black. Color is not vivid and it continues to give me a message that my ink is low even though I have replaced my cartridge with a brand new one! It does not print quality-looking photos and the ink does seem to go extremely fast. I wish I'd have bought something other than a Lexmark. I guess you get what you pay for.
1," Durable and as described: So far, it has held up well. It was a gift and came with the official product tag attached to the handle."
0," great acting, but unbearably BORING: I like and respect all of the actors that were in this film, and they did a great job as usual. However, the performances could not cover up the fact that almost nothing happened the entire movie. I was so bored I almost left the theatre, but just forced myself to finish because I already bought my ticket. I don't understand how watching Kevin Bacon pace around his room, and occasionally break down to his therapist and Kyra Sedwick over and over again can make up a two hour movie. That is really all that happened for three quarters of the movie, then an unfulfilling ending. I'm actually quite suprised so many people wrote all these great reviews about it, it was painfully boring and bleak. Don't see it if you're expecting a powerful, thought-provoking film like I did, you will be dissapointed."
1," Absolutely Magical: Kate's ability to transcend current pop mediocrity and remain true to her vision is remarkable. Her music is just as relevant as where she left off.Disc 1: ""A Sea of Honey"" explores a number of musical styles and ideas, from the double-edged sword of celebrity, ""King of the Mountain"" to the loss of a loved one, ""A Coral Room"". One of the highlights is Joanni, a brooding percussion driven ode to Joan of Arc.Disc 2: ""A Sky of Honey"" is a sonic journey through the course of a day and night. From the opening of birdsong and childs voice, ""Prelude"" through an artists muse in ""An Architects Dream"" and culminating in the beautiful ""Nocturn"" and ""Aerial"". She is truely a painter with music as the medium. This disc holds together as a set piece with mingling orchestration and themes.Beautiful from start to finish, a true artists expression.Long live Kate and her music!"
0," Shocking: The cannibalism wasn't shocking, neither was the 6-inches left of intestine, or the doubled-over piece of wax... the self-mutilations weren't shocking either... nor the baby-stew. What was most shocking was my inability to suspend belief. Mistaking pregoria for a septuagenarian... well, then these people, these figures away at this writer's retreat, are really too stupid to live. Furthermore, the belief that they will find financial gain in how they suffered is completely foolish. If these people were the most jaded, as proposed, then they'd understand such shock value would only carry them through a week... maybe a month, only to be replaced by something more absurd, pathetic and disturbing.Chuck Palahniuk has written some fine novels, has had some great plotting devices and interesting character development. In Haunted, though, these attributes are absent."
0, caution: I was excited to recive as I also own the sling ted to recive as I also own the sling by outward hound. Unfortunatlng by outward hound and love it. Unfortunatly was a bit dissatisfied with this front carrier. The front part is well constructed and sturdy but then the actual straps that go over your shoulder are flimsy and thin. I wish they would have padded them like normal backpacks but the straps make me worried about the lack of support from the straps. The pic of the model looks nice but when I wore it looked about ten months prego and struggled to walk upright. Might just be me but if the straps worked more like a backpack it would have been great. Just feel they cut cost on the worse part.
1," Great Product, a real Work Horse: I have been using the 12 cup model for a year now...my first food processor and I love it. I am on a raw food diet, so I use this food processor at least once or twice a day. I have the clear/white handled model. I have come to see that food residue is going into the clear handle and I can't seem to rinse it out even with baking soda and vinegar. I would like to be able to take it apart to clean inside, but feel that I may damage the appliance by taking it apart and see no clear way to take handle apart. I find I mostly use the big bowl with the S-blade and also the grating and slicing blades. Never use the small or intermediate bowls at all....it's is just easier to clean out the big bowl and start over. All in all I am very happy with my purchase."
0," WTF!: Being a real Drill Sergeant, I bought this as a spare, but when I took it out the box...WTF? It's a TOY! If this was for a halloween costume or some bit, it would be perfect. So let that be a lesson, Kids....don't expect professional gear at what-ta bargain prices!"
1," a good workout: Purchased this so I could amp up my yoga routine - falls somewhere between a ""workout"" and ""traditional yoga."" The moves are fast-paced and can be challenging. Good video."
1," Wedding the Highlander: Once I open one of janet Chapman's books I do not want to put it down. She keeps the story line interesting, and humorious. I highly recommend this book.Ruth Riddle"
1," A Childhood in Exile: By now, the story of Oscar Wilde's glorious rise and tragic fall are well-known. But most readers are unfamiliar with the story of how Wilde's wife and two sons were affected by his fall from grace. ""Son of Oscar Wilde"" is a beautifully written and poignant account of how a young boy's life was afected by his father's notoriety. Like his father, Holland carefully avoids self-pity in describing his life's events and still manages to convey a sense of loss and disorientation which is most heartwrenching. Holland's recollections of his father are priceless, and the book is an essential volume for anyone interested in Wilde the personality. Amazon.com was able to find a copy of this book for me in no time at all, and at a very reasonable price."
1," Movie Sound track from ""The constant gardener"": Hauntingly beatiful music that goes perfectly well with the movie and the book. I listen to this sound track often."
1, S. Kingston: Good music. Not just a one-hitter! He'll go for a while with other catchy lyrics and sounds like those on this disc!
0," Not Worth The Money: I fell for the hype about ""never losing suction,"" but I found that it didn't have much suction to begin with. After using it several times and being dissatisfied with its performance on my carpets, I decided today to test it against my other vacuum cleaner, a Bissell, that has great suction. Starting with an area of 5 feet by 5 feet, I thoroughly cleaned with the Dyson, going over and over the rug. Then I went over the same area with the Bissell, and I was amazed at what the Bissell pulled up that the Dyson missed. Lots of cat hair and lots of kitty litter tracked into the room by my 7 cats."

1," Decent fun: I caught the end of this on television the other night. I'd forgotten how funny, if predictable, it was and Hugh Grant is a lot of fun in it. The plot concerns a dapper Englishman who marries into the mob, and gets to meet all the inlaws - what follows is mad cap comedy, kind of along the lines of meet the parents.This really is a funny film, and perhaps Liz Hurley should produce another comedy.That's right - Liz Hurley produced it."
1," Better than most day trading books.: I have read most of the day trading books out there now. When it comes to what day traders do on a daily basis, no book has been better. I sat down with this book and wrote down all of the tips these traders gave and I came to one concusion, that is trade stocks with high liquidity, making money both on the upside and back down, limit losses while maximizing gains, and learn from your mistakes. This book really cuts through the gibberish that most books give and gives you bare-bones what to do."
1," Nice perfume: I got this perfume in Orlando at Epcot and love it. As I read the last review was not about the perfume but about the seller. I think this perfume is great, smells really good and lasts all day. It`s not over powering but a nice smell."
1, Pictures are Great: Don't let the publication date discourage you from considering this book. The photos are complement other bird books. We use it often on outings.
1," A decent Keyboard/Mouse, don't expect much from the speakers.: The Keyboard and Mouse on this set are great... nice and functional/responsive.The price point is good. The speakers are lousy. Only necessary if you have no speakers at all and want to save as much money as possible, don't expect to enjoy the sound outta these.For the price it's a good starter set for a low-end setup or salvage computer... maybe a hand me down to someone?The best computer speakers I've listened to are USB driven with external power. These will cost more."

1," Return of the Best: Receiving Sword at Sunset was renewing an old friendship. I first read this book in my twenties and the ripples spreading from that discovery have never stopped. Legends of Arthur, Celtic lore, British history, ancient Europe and so many more interests that have enriched my life all have their beginning in this book. Long ago I lost that first paperback copy, but here it is again and I couldn't be more pleased."

Flash and Green arrow don't even wear their classic suits...they just wear hoodies...How gay is that!? Clark doesn't even wear disguise glasses. So there's no way the characters could be too dumb not to figure out what clark looked like with huge frames! Rosenbaum and Glover are gone, so this means we've got a middle school acting level on our hands. Stories are pointless...Tom Welling is 32! When does superman really come out!? when he's 40???? No, even if they do give us the suit their probably gonna turn it into something extremely inadequate. like give him a hood and a cape. leave the S logo out and the tights. (not that I'm in favor of the tights it's just that there authentic!)SERIOUSLY! SUPERMANS FLIGHT AND SUIT DEFINE WHO HE IS...NOW WE WANT TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0," Older is NOT better: Older Dream Theater, and this CD is from 1992, is just not as good. I'm a huge DT fan, especially their more recent stuff, but the old stuff sounds more pop/van halen/over simplified. After listening to the musical masterpiece Metropolis II, which I think is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, Metropolis I was a huge letdown. There were some recurring musical themes between the two, but the first one had down downright 'dinky' parts to it. Progressive rock has come a long way, and Dream Theater is one of the best and brightest stars on the Prog Rock venue... but that doesn't mean their old stuff is any good. Avoid this CD at all costs."
0," Pure Junk!!!: I purchased this toy for my sons birthday, we've had it out of the box 5 days and we've attempted to play with it only twice. My first impression, once out of the box was aweful, with the 25+ pieces I had to put together, which took about an hour, only for the end result to be about 5 minutes of play time before it started coming apart! The pieces of the track don't stay together from the jump start, most of his hot wheel cars won't work with it, the slime is completely aweful, messy and a pain to clean up. After each use you have to clean up the mess in order to preserve the slime. Tonight after 2 additional minutes of play time, I've decided to take my lost and throw it away entirely...except my son wants to keep the slime! $49 dollars for slime makes me want to gag. If there is a lemon law for toys, this one by mattel wins hands down!!!"
0," Another terrible cd from the #1anti-sax player of all time!: This is definitely Kenny G's worst work since The Moment.

1, Brilliant: I just love Sailor Moon. I have tons of collectible items. I can't find any toys though. I always got up at 6:00a.m. to watch it. I even nearly missed an episode because the clocks went forward and I ended up watching it at 7:00a.m. on fox kids plus. I hated fox kids for not airing it so I entered loads of comps to win video's/dvd's and have told my parents I want video's from Amazon or E.Bay for my birthday. I'm Sailor Moons biggest fan.
0, SQUEKY SPRINGS: In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
0," Magic Slate: I was disappointed in the quality of this magic slate product for the price. It looked sturdy on the picture but is really a flimsy cardboard, not even flat. It is like the old 5 and 10 cent store magic slates with the twist that instead of pulling up to erase you slide the sheets...and they sometimes gets stuck when sliding them back into place. The best I can say is that the magic slate serves its purpose."
1," The music that I've used to un-wind and meditate.: I'm not a musician and I really don't count as any sort of expert. And, truthfully, for many years during the '70's (my college years), I found the Moody Blues kind of--well, depressing. This was the first Moody Blues album that I ever bought, and it is still the one that I enjoy the most. The original version of Legend of A Mind is more melodic than the later version in the box-set (which I also heard during a concert in New Haven, Ct. a few years ago), and Legend of a Mind and OM have always helped me to climb-down from the workday and become human again. And, I like the continuity of the album; it has never been just a set of disjointed songs to me."

The new product on the street both via Multiline Marketing and direct merchandising is scalar energy. Scalar Energy looks like the science of tomorrow and gets away from the SRT and MRT so to speak technology. Google Scalar Energy and read the science not the MLM's advertising. The BarronReport from 2001 and any article you can get about Nikole Tesla, the discover of Scalar Energy. A Scalar Energy pendant will emit longitudinal energy 1.75 feet out from the body. I would recommend this first and the fon chip after."
1," Brief songs, somber instrumentals, beautiful simplicity: I'm a big fan of the Eels, especially their first works (Beautiful Freak, Electroshock Blues, and Daisies of the Galaxy). This score is an excellent compilation, much of which is based on the same few basic melodies. These deceptively simple patterns unfold into a beautiful variety of music. Check out my favorite track from the album ""Haunted Piano #1"" for a sample. ""Running the Bath"" is probably most representative of the overall tone and feel of the album. Levity's brevity (gwah hah hah!) is the only downside. All but 2 of the tracks fall into the one to two and a half minute mark, making some of them seem like samples instead of full tracks. Given the ambient nature of the pieces they really should go on longer. Definately go for it if you are a fan of the Eels or any other tingly, experi-pop-orchestrock. Keep in mind most of the album is instrumental, in case you need ""singing or guitars"" to enjoy music."
1," Harsh Times Indeed !: ""Harsh Times"" takes you on a rollercoaster ride into the twisted psyche of a deeply disturbed individual. Who better to do this than Christian Bale, one of the greatest actors working today. He takes you deep into the mind of a self destructive and tormented character. Harsh ? Yes, but Bale makes this movie well worth watching and his performance will certainly give you something to think about."
1," Classic Screwball: If you enjoy the classic screwball comedies of Preston Sturges (The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels), you'll enjoy this. It's not great, but it is very good. I was pleasantly surprised"
1," Best Yoga DVD in my collection: I recently purchased this dvd and I am so glad I did. Like many other reviewers, I love the matrix and find it easy to use. I have many yoga programs on dvd and I prefer the ones set outdoors. However, some of the ones I have recently purchased were lacking in their ability to help grow a practice. This dvd is perfect and I can see myself using it for years to come as I become more experienced at yoga. So far the lunar sequences are my favorites."
0," ""Blowfly"" blows.....: When this book came out, I grabbed it up expecting another fast and furious ride with Kay and Company. Instead I get a load of gratuitous sex of the saddest kind, bumbling ""investigators"", a stumbling plot line (I'm being kind here). Hideous, heinous, horrible.... you get the point, dear reader.I really didn't think this author could make a misstep, boy was I WRONG. Hope she gets her act together... a mind like hers is a terrible thing to waste.I've waited a while before indulging in my favorite detective's world, hope it's straightened out and Kay is once again on top of her game."
1," excellent fast paced thriller with offbeat characters: I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Baltimore, preceding me. This novel has a wonderful fast paced plot with lots of unexpected events along the way. The characters are multidimensional and although most of them are quite offbeat, they come off as being real and not just caricatures. This book is a fast, entertaining, hard-to-put-down read and I'd highly recommend it."
1," Works: What can be said? It's a phone line with two jacks on the end. I have a DSL modem plugged into one and the phone plugged into the other and they both work fine. Nice length if you have to run line, as I did. I haven't had it for long, but I don't see what issue I would have with it later."
0," save your money, buy a $10 walmart special: I've had this watch 2 1/2 years. it's been back for repair 4 times. The only good thing was the J&R; jeweler's warranty. First the metal band broke after a year. I could live with that but 20 months it started to loose time. I put up with this for a couple of months. Than it would stop running. The manual claims it will run for 6 months after full charge. I charged it according to the manual, stopped after two weeks. Took it to J&R; they sent it back. Waited 6 weeks got it back, nothing was fixed.Sent back 3 more times(a month wait each time) and still has not been fixed. The $10 walmart special I bought as backup keeps better time and when it stops, for $10 a new watch. Save your $200 don't buy this watch."
1, Humidifier Filters: I have used the Hamilton Beach 05910 Humidifier for several years. The filters last a long time providing you use them as directed. I have been very satisfied with this product and with Amazon's price and timely delivery.
0," Scam pans: My husband and I spent several hundred dollars getting many of these pans. We followed the cooking instructions while using them and within a year the coating started bubbling and then peeled. With the lifetime warranty we wrote to the company and asked what we could to do to get our pans replaced. To our amazement we were told they would help us only if we had our receipt... So, now we are left with very expensive pans we can't use.. If I were any of you, I would really look at other options... We are very disappointed in the way we were treated and the quality of the pans."
0," I thought they must have dumbed down the...: ...book to make the movie; but it's a hard contest to know which is MORE dumb! (I know, great English on my part). It was enjoyable, not great literature. It gives me a pretty good idea of what Oprah's book club must be like."
1, Thank you: It arrived in great order. A great movie and insightful. Can be applied to life's lessons in many different ways.
0," Disappointed=[: I usually use Manic Panic hair dye, but I heard that Special Effects hair dyes lasted longer so I decided to try it out. Sooo after I put the dye in, rinsed it out, dried my hair, etc., I was so so happy because this wildflower color is BEAUTIFUL! Obviously i expected the color to fade a bit over the next few weeks, however, after only three or four days the color was completely out. It was really sad=[So yeah, to sum everything up- if you only want a really temporary dye, just for a night or something, then I would recommend this dye, cause it is a really, really nice color. But if you want a dye that'll last more then three days? look elsewhere."
1, Love this stand mixer.: I finally took the plunge and bought this large capacity stand mixer and have used it many times since my purchase in mid-December. It is such a joy to use that it has inspired my non-cooking/baking husband to take up a new hobby. He enjoys this mixer as much as I do and has used it almost as much as I have since we got it. The profile is sleek and it is powerful and easy to use. I love the countdown time too! It has a better than average warranty which helped clinch my decision. I'm purchasing the pasta maker to go with it. Highly recommended.
1, Great movie: I was so glad to get this or my daughter! She loved it! Fun and great movie magic! I recommend it
1," Great, convienent product: Ulti-Mate Dispenser is a handy & attractive product to have in the shower. I have had several similar to this style over the years. It elminates bottles, etc. in the shower. Everything is right there. I would recommend this product to anyone."
0," Could have been better.: I was really hoping this game would be good, unfortunately I didn't like it.The Pros:Its a great idea.The voice acting is pretty good.The graphics were better than I expected.The motions are quite realistic.The sounds are awesome.The Cons:Bad AI (After 1 shot everyone in the map suddenly seems to know where you are, its incredibly hard to be stealthy in this game, and hiding doesn't do anything. Even when they shouldn't be able to see you, they shoot and kill you within 6-8 shots.)Sniping is to easy.Your able to walk directly up a wall face. It seems to be a glitch, one that could have been fixed.In night missions you are given a rifle with a night vision scope on it, which makes it nearly impossible to use.Multi-player is fun but in most games people just use the hugely overpowered Grenade launcher and spawn kill.I had high hopes for this game, but ultimately it failed."
1," A Mystery To Befuddle Sherlock Homes!: Take a large helping of mystery, add a heap of suspense and sprinkle liberally with a charming romance, and you've got one of the best mysteries this side of Sherlock. And don't worry, the unlike some myserties, you'll be guessing the whole way through, and still be left in shock!"
1, Ralphie in Hi Def: The Blu-ray disc is a real treat that preserves this holiday gem in all its nostalgic glory. Even Raphie's father would have liked it!
0," Easy to see why Americans are doing so poorly with money: If this book represents the best advice available to Americans (according to consumers report), no wonder Americans are doing so poorly with their finances.In Japan, we save on average 30% of our income and are debt free. In America, you try to live on 125% of your income and are deep in debt. Unfortunately, books like this one by Quinn will only make things worse not better.Only in America can a mediocre book like this one be touted as the best information available.Unbelievable!"
1," Good overview book: This book is required for my immunology course, and is a very good, easy-to-understand description of the immune system. It also has much shorter chapters than in most of my other textbooks."
1," Almost Perfect: I gave this 4 stars mainly because the convenience/performance trumps everything when it comes to parchment (i hate those rolls!) BUT there are a few minor imperfections. (1) The sheets come all rolled up together in a rubber band - i wish they were in a flat box; (2) I have the goldtouch W.S. 18x13 baking sheets and the parchment was still a little larger than the sheet; and (3) the sheets aren't perfectly cut rectangles (just slightly off - you can tell when you fold it in half). That being said, the parchment lies flat after you unroll it and you can still kind of tuck in the sides to fit in the baking sheet. My cookies cooked great and no more trying to flatten that darn parchment!"
1, Looks like a nice product: I bought this as a gift for a guitar player friend who is a big fan of Warren and the Mule. She loved it.
1," Excellent: Since I am an avid Columbo fan, this DVD set is just what I wanted. I liked the fact that I could read little excepts for each show, and thereby get some of my favorite episodes."
0," Norwegian ""lapstick"", completely unfunny: I am not up on my Norwegian humor but I am hoping this is not the mainstream over there.Dimension seems to be going this way of late, not sure why though. This one follows the plot of Kill Bill, except all guy on guy humor, guy on animal humor and gross out unfunny humor. I am sure I missed all of the ""Laplander"" inside jokes, but the constant gay sex, animal sex, urination humor, even a Deliverance homage, all fell flat.The picture quality looks great, especially with all the beautiful countryside they filmed in, but the sound was a mess. No special features but you do have the option of the native language or English dub (was a bad dub). I think the joke might be on Amazon as the clip they have here was translated much differently in the film - that last clip he says something much different. Skipper."
1," Best thing - every baby should have one: This is just ""the toy."" I received this as a shower gift but when my baby was born, he was scared witless of it. After about 5 months, he fell in love with it and used it daily. He loved to figure out what all the toys did, the cause and effect, and all the lights and music it makes just intrigued him for hours. Now he's three and still likes it! It's a standup keyboard now and he loves making music with it. Just one of those toys that should be in every home."
0," Appalling Misfire From A Great Organist: When I first heard this I nicknamed it 'the vampire's Christmas'. Everything from the lowering drawing of the performer on the cover to the choice of materiel for the improvisations is misjudged . I had picked it up in a post-holiday sale bin. (Exactly where it belongs.)Guillou is one of the world's great organists, but that doesn't guarantee good taste or good sense.It represents one of the very few misfires for both performer and for the Dorian label.I can't imagine why anybody would want to listen to it for anything other than Guillou's improvisatory skills and extraordinary technique.Not the Christmas CD to curl up with with your family !Dorian (circa 1988) wins back some points for the excellent sound recording."
1," A Must Read for Every Young Woman: This book was such a fresh breath of air. Shannon is a great writer and truly cares for the reader. Each page is thought provoking and explains the importance of sexual, emotional, physical, and spiritual purity. I have purchased 8 copies and given them to friends. You WILL NOT be disappointed!"
0," Stripped Boring Read: I have read several Brian Freeman books but found his book Stripped to be much too long and boring. It has a good plot but too many subplots that had no place and were unnecessary to the story. The whole subplot about Serena was boring and a waste to the plot of the book. As a result of reading this book, I am reconsidering reading any more Freeman books. I loved some of his previous works and wish Maggie and Stride were back again."
0," Oh dear....: I hate to be so negative here but oh dear me. The DVD was only 25 minutes long and much of this was taken up with Yoga for the hands. I have since noticed another DVD dealing with the same subject matter, available on this site, which is 2.5 hours long! Now that's more like it!I just felt completely short changed, however much I paid for it. I think if it had been called ""A Very Brief and Playful Introduction to Finger Cymbals"" I wouldn't have felt the need to join in here.Ho Hum!"
1, The Quran translation and commentary: I find this to be a difficult read but the commentaries are very halpful. I am new to Islam and I have found many answers to many questions through this publication. Thank you for your time.
0, No radio for alarm #1: Don't buy this if you want radio or a buzzer for the first alarm. You musat use a CD for alarm #1.
1," Her favorite: My wife's current favorite fragrance. Quick easy delivery of this gift. And, it is a great fragrance."
1, Very Good CD: I would recommend this CD. It has enough variety but not so much that the CD doesn't flow. The lead singers voice is hauntingly beautiful
1," WAI!!!!!!!: Shinohara Tomoe is so ultra Kawaii!!! if you ever get a chance to hear her song Ultra Relax, LISTEN! Shopping A-Z will make you want to shop till you drop (or they kick you outta teh store for hopping around like you had too much sugar!) Her songs are like eating bags of sugar!!!"
1," I like it, sort of: I don't really *like* the book's subject matter, but it is useful. It has some very good ideas, as well as some useless ones- Some of the prestige classes just don't get enough of a boost."
0," not our favorite playmobil advent calendar: This advent calendar is pretty lackluster, many of the days are boring. Last year we had winter in the park and it was much more suited towards christmas. We didn't realize that the knights wouldn't have anything to do with xmas at all and just provided a bunch of crappy swords and nothing that was really exciting for toddlers. Maybe this would be better for much older kids, but other advent calendars we've gotten have been fun for all ages."
0," Next to Worst of Grisham novels: I was dispointed by the political agenda that Grisham is beginning to object in his novels, and the intellectual intensity combined with some action is no longer in his plots. I felt like I should read an advertisement for the homeless and while notable I can do that without the help of a book. Still it was better than the Partner because I must have that at least somewhat optimistic ending."
0," What I wish I'd known before I bought it...: I bought this book because I have read other books by Jane Lindskold and thought that the premise sounded interesting. However, 1 or 2 chapters into the book I was quite surprised by the multiple uses of the f word, and the inapropiate sexual remarks made in the ""jungle"". Just a warning..."
0," GoBack trashes hard drives!!: If you purchase this product, I strongly suggest not installing GoBack during setup. I have a system with 2 hard drives where the second drive is primarily used for backup. I had GoBack installed, and there was a problem with the backup drive. My PC would not boot to Windows because GoBack was not able to access all of its data. I tried unhooking the backup drive, and still couldn't boot to Windows. During bootup, there is a GoBack splash screen saying ""press spacebar for options"", but pressing spacebar yields an error message, followed by ""press any key to restart"". Without being able to get to Windows, there is no way to disable GoBack, and GoBack will not allow Windows to start (not even in safe mode). I have now lost the data on my hard drive, as well as the data on my backup. Thank you Norton."
1," Honey Crystals: The packaging doesn't tell you how much honey is in the product which is a drawback since they are advertised as Honey Crystals. These do have a high sugar content, but even so I like them and have used them in several things I've made and in my coffee. If you are looking for something without processed sugar, these are not for you. Are they worth the price? Depends on what you're really looking for."
1," KitchenAid Gourmet Cookware: Good value and constructed very well. The glass lids are nice as you can see what is happening inside the cookward but as the instructions do say, the handles for the lids do get warm."
0," Boring: This movie is soooooo boring. But, if you're a Poseidon fan, you should still see it. But even then, it will still be boring."
0," Leaks after a few months: I bought this less than 6 months ago and it now leaks. There is a rubber gasket seal on the underneath of the jar assembly which no longer seals after maybe 20 or 30 uses. Through normal use (making smoothies) its been dislodged so part of the seal is pulled into the shaft to the cutter blades and the rest of the seal extented outside the edge of the metal washer. I've pulled it apart to fix it, which works for a while but the problem repeats itself, the seal now no longer seals for more than a couple of goes.This is the only Waring product I've owned and it will be the last based on this blender as its about to be thrown out and buy a different one.On the plus side, when it didn't leak it was a good blender."
0, Long-winded. Wordy. Hard to read past page twenty.: Like I said in my summary. Long-winded. Wordy. Hard to read past page twenty.
0," Don't waste your money: My husband bought this for our 3 year old son for his birthday. He is a big fan of the Cars Movie, and we thought it looked fun, with different scenes and a car launcher. Our son did love it, but hasn't played with it since the day he received it. It is frustrating for him to put together, and it is frustrating for me as a parent to put away when he is done. You have to cram all the parts into the truck, align the sides perfectly, and turn a fin on the top to lock it. No matter how many times I try, the lock doesn't hold the truck closed. If your child likes Mack, buy the Mack Truck Playset instead. It is a much higher quality toy than the Pitcrew Performance Playset."
0," completely uninspiring: I was anxiously waiting to receive this dvd in the mail. I was quite dissapointed. It was confusing, boring, slow moving and had some car chases. Big deal. So did Bullitt and that was a lot better. DeNiro spouted lines from Heat, which I wish would come out on dvd already. This was a big waste of time. Don't bother."
1," Fun entertainment: This was a pleasant feel good book about an elderly lady and her attitude toward life and death. It has a happy ending, pleasant writing, good character development and leaves you smiling. It does poke some fun at conventional religious beliefs but it is done with humor and kindness, not animosity."
0," Victory at Sea: The History channel should be ashamed of this effort. I have seen the PBS broadcasts and indeed the original broadcasts on NBC in the 50""s All were quality B&W; films.This DVD has, aside from the audio problems mentioned in other reviews, has muddy, low contrast, all gray images commensurate with 10th generation dubs. Viewing and listening are an unpleasant experience."
0," Are 3 junk games better than 1 good game?: NO! Go spend your allowance money on a good game like Medal of Honor or Driver, rather than this ""trilogy"". Just in case you're curious, here's what the three games consist of:PART 1 - a poorly made third person shooter with bad graphicsPART 2 - a poorly made rail shooter where you follow the exact same path again-and-again (like an arcade lightgun game)PART 3 - a poorly made driving gameI literally played this trilogy for forty-five minutes (15 minutes each game), and I was already sick of it. If these games were movies, they would be the equivalent of poorly-made home flicks. Grade Z."
1," Electronic Experience Rquired: Very useful circuit which can be adopted to various needs. Kit was received in the specified time frame and I was satisfied with its design and instructions. However, if you do not have any electronic experience, the instructions would not be specific enough for you to assembly the kit, as being able to read and decifer a schematic is asolutely required. Also, experience with microcircuit soldering is necessary. The reason for the four star rating is due to the instructions/schematics which do not entirely correspond with the actual wiring of the circuit, hence the requirement for electronic experience. The product description does not make any mention of the circuit's output being momentarily activated upon the initial input trigger, this makes a difference when this action is undesirable and presents the need to personally design an addition to the circuitry to eliminate this momentary output."
1," Great Investment for Child Safety: We had another harness for my son and the clasps broke so it wouldn't stay on. I saw this product, which while not the same does a similar thing, and I'm glad that we bought this one it's a lot more durable and the straps are longer so it fits more comfortably on him and he's not complaining about it.I love that we can let him walk with us at the mall and out around town again without the risk of him running too far ahead or getting lost, or worse bolting out into the road and getting hit by a car.I highly recommend this item."
0, Re-Hash: If you are buying one more book to fill your Luger library and have no other titles to get then this one will fill that slot. As far as in depth information and something you haven't learned several times before then book doesn't have it. While the name Encyclopedia tells you what it is don't expect to find any new data by John Walker even if it was written in 1985 he just rehashed prior work.
1," Dark, Sinister, But So Much Fun: It's like sucking on a sour candy; when you get to the middle, it's sweet (aaawwwwh). But seriously, if you enjoy Mick Karn, than this album is definitely a collectors item, if only for the fact that it reunites David Sylvian and Mick. Guests feature Steve Jansen and Richard Barbierri (all four members of Japan, and you're not going to find that again until Rain Tree Crow), so be prepared to get all hyped up on goofballs kids, cuz...well, just cuz."
1," A good yarn: I like sea stories, Horneblower and Aubrey. I would like to give four and a half stars but, this not being possible, I gave 4 stars. The reason for the missing star is too much ""atmosphere"" or so called ""psychology"" rather than action and seamanship."
1," oven feedback I find useful: I do a lot of cooking and figured for a few dollars investment I should test out the true heat of my oven. My oven is a GE Profile Convection oven, purchased 4 yrs ago new. I don't know if the thermometer is supposed to read identically with the preheated oven when the buzzer sounds on oven, mine didn't; the gauge was 20 to 40 degrees less; but after a total of 30 mins, it registered the temp that the oven said it should be, so perhaps the time for an accurate reading on this is longer than the time the oven preheats? There was no enclosed info on this, so that would have been nice to know...other than that, I feel it did tell me that my oven is reaching the temp it needs to, just not within 15 mins time. I""m ok with that. At least knowing that much now gives me the knowledge to make adjustments at the beginning of cooking time if I want to."
1," Introduction to Jazz Through Pop: Diana Krall does it again. By recording old pop standards with a jazz undertow, Diana is re-introducing jazz to the mainstream public. I always look forward to the bridge were Diana's excellent piano playing with the accompliment of other musicians makes the songs something more than just someone signing an old pop standard."
0, It was ok.: This book was very short. It was ok. I really like Ed and Loraine Warren. This was not one of their best books. Not sure it was worth what I paid.
1, BB2000: Good product - living up to my expectations. Delivered by Amazon earlier than published at ordering.
0," Nice idea, but junk construction: Seemed like such an amazingly quiet device. It was a few months before I realized there's a fan inside the unit to move air, and that fan is frozen in place (I can push the blades around with a stick, but they're very very stiff.)Junk. Too bad, I liked the idea."
1, 18in Diamond Cut Rope Chain: The chain appears to be of good quality and I have paired it with a pendant that is brought out by the style of the chain. All in all it was a good purchase!
0, Not what I envisioned: The loveseat saver did not do what I thought it would do. I put it under my cushions and I can't really tell any difference. I would have liked to have had it firm up my loveseat at least a little but it didn't at all.
1," Awesome: I am into origami. This book may not be traditional origami, but it challenges the mind that wants a challenge. My favorite origami book!"
0," So you want to be a mortgage Broker: Its ONE big advert for the mortgage company, 29 pages on how to contact the company and buy more books and items. It does have a couple of chapters that helped me, but its frustrating that it keeps refering to the company that published it, to sell there loan products."
1," Save The Last Dance: I absolutely love this movie. The story line is great. Music is great, and Julia Stiles is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this movie"
0," A flop: This book tells us about the rules of the e-world. It's opportunities,threats and what you have to do to win on it. Nevertheless, it's written not in a very clear way. Some people may face some difficulties in understand its concepts. The first part Reach vs Richness is great, but the following sections fail to consolidate these ideas... This book doesn't worth the time and money for reading it."
1," I'll Never Look at Water the Same Way Again...: This is one of the best memoir's I've ever read. I wish the book never ended and when it did, that I could have bought the next one about how their lives are now."
0," Not a very good book.: I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm not new to HTML, CSS or webwriting, but new to Dreamweaver. This book is literally littered with errors, mistakes and other incorrectnesses. It doesn't look like the proof reader had a bad day; he simply wasn't there! The single chapter about CSS alone is worth looking at other books. It [is not good] is a major understatement. Better look at an online free tutorial for that chapter.Ms. Gutman knows here stuff, so much is clear. But being a teacher is a different profession, and not all can do that. Ms. Gutman clearly can't. A less experienced writer with better teaching skills could do a much better job. I'm currently trying to negotiate a refund from the publisher. I rate this book that bad.I bougth it because it has ASP, ASP.NET and PHP tutorials.Had these been absent, I would have gone for the Dreamweaver MX bible. A MUCH better choice.I rate it one star, because lower is not possible."
0, disappointing: I had order this product previously and I was shocked at how it has changed. It looks extremely cheaply/poorly made. I just hope they work.
0," Great for fans only.: I found the packaging and marketing of these Prisoner DVD volumes a bit misleading. I was expecting something more from the special features. There really are no special features to speak of..not really. A and E advertises the special features in vol. 1 including deleted scenes and clips. Actually, these are a couple of short b-roll clips without sound. In other words, they are literally a 30 second shot of a file cabinet and then a silent shot of some other prop. These are just scraps from the editing floor...not even outtakes. It's just an a stupid reason to claim ""special features"".As for the show itself. It looks great and if you're predisposed to like this kind of stuff...it's great. So if you're a big fan of the prisoner...then by all means spend more money on your obsession. Otherwise..wait for the Robert McQaurry movie or rent the entire VHS series from a good video store."
1, Short and sweet!: The fundamental for any and all Buddhist / Psychology book collections. If you could own just one book by Deepak - this should probably be it!
0," Earth to JC! Please phone home.....: I've been a fan of Carroll's for years; sometimes felt I was the only person in on the secret. He defies the normal genre categories: his novels--beautifully written, teasingly plotted, quite often quite terrifying--combine horror and fantasy, flirt with matters metaphysical, don't ever entirely depart from the conventions of ""mainstream"" literary fiction. So it was extremely upsetting for me to find I just couldn't finish this book....just too whimsical, too exasperatingly arbitrary in its narrative development, too self-consciously darkly cute (or cutely dark). I want the Carroll who reminds me of Robert Aickman, not the Carroll who reminds me of a schizophrenic Walt Disney..."
1," Would make a great movie!: This was a remarkable story about `the greatest team you never heard of `. 10 of the players on the University of San Francisco Dons made the NFL and 3 became Hall of Fame players. The school's publicity manager was Pete Rozell, future Commissioner of the NFL during its peak growth period. One of their best players was injured before he played in the NFL but became the first black official of any professional sport; he officiated for 25 years.Well, why hasn't anyone heard of them? It was because of racial discrimination from the outside, and that's what the story is about.This would make a great movie. You couldn't make this story up! Is anyone in Hollywood paying attention?"
0," Won't Purchase: I was getting ready to buy this item, Quickverse 8.0, but after Reading the review by ""True Grit"" I've changed my mind. It never pays to stiff your customers!"
1," It's incredible how wise Dan is: If only I could speak like this man. You will learn a lot from him. You can trust that he will help guide you in the right direction. For the average Joe the read takes a little effort, but believe me it's worth reading any of his books."
1," Solid Help for Couples that Remarry: This is a well-written, informative, helpful book for couples that choose to remarry. I've never been a fan of ""step-"" anything (hate the label stepmom that applies to me!) but I set aside my dislike for the title and actually read this book. Glad I did.There is a lot of useful material here about bonding together in a marriage that may not be a first one for you, your partner, or both. Good solid ways to connect, unify, and move forward. Very well done!Lauren HodgeApple Valley, CaliforniaI also highly recommend:Happily Remarried: Making Decisions Together * Blending Families Successfully * Building a Love That Will Last"
0," Interpol have fallen from grace: Interpol's sophomore album, ""Antics"" falls short. This is a band that had some potential, but decided to take the low road, and cash in their chips... ""Slow Hands"" isn't too bad, but that is only because it resembles the Joy Division classic ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". The rest of the album is too similar to even bother listening to. They wrote one song, changed a few things to stretch it out into 9 more songs. Interpol need to spend a little more time writing songs than grooming and staring at themselves in the mirror. In the end, the looks aren't what people remember... It's the music."
1," Outer Limits 45th Anniversary Edition: A single release of this 60's SciFi series was a welcome addition to my DVD video collection.A recent visit to the local best buy clocked the series at nearly $100 for the three individual volumes. BB had this new single set priced at a savings of 50%.I was impressed with crisp clean EZ to use menus. The B/W video and Mono audio quality was excellent.I did miss bonus extras, and the lack of closed captions for those of us with less than perfect hearing was also sorely missed.Others have mention problems with the double sided discs. My toshiba DVD player had NO such troubles. Either disc quality has improved, or maybe these other people just need to upgrade their hardware.While the ""monster"" FXs are very dated, the stories have held up well over the years. All in all, enjoyable to watch.4 stars."
1," CMW-100 Solved! the would run as if normal, but didn't heat problem: I noticed some people were having the same problem as me. I'd start the microwave & everything looked normal (lights on, spinning,etc), but it didn't heat/cook. I tried a different outlet in another room and it worked, but when I tried it in the outlet in the original location, once again, it didn't work, so I just determined it was an electrical issue - my CMW-100 didn't like that particular outlet or vice versa. Anyway, I ended up buying a Belkin power outlet with 3k+ joules and now my microwave when used with the new power outlet works fine! Btw, I'm very happy with the microwave itself too."
0, Dissapointing: Pretty dissapointed in the third movie. I highly enjoyed Wrong Turn 1 and 2 so I was very much looking forward to the third movie to come out. This one seemed lower quality than the other two. Bad acting and very fake-looking backgrounds at times did not make this movie very scary and thrilling. I would highly recommend renting before you buy so you don't waste your money on this one.
0, so so: The shirt is ok for the price. I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt! So that is what you are looking for don't hesitate in purchasing it!
1," Terrific...a must-have!: This game...wow, what can I say? This is the best game I have for the DS, one that I find myself going back to over, and over, and over again. The premise is simple...combine like-colored ""meteos"" in an attempt to launch them into space, should the planet's gravity permit it. It's a creative, fun variation on Tetris, and offers a ton of unlockables, several different modes, and a multiplayer option that is incredibly intense and enjoyable. The graphics are great, with bright, vibrant colors, and the music, believe it or not, is actually quite good, with different tunes for each planet. In short, a great puzzler, perhaps the best game out there for DS right now...get yours today!"
1," Going Back to What Was Good: I have just ordered Katherine to read again, also Green Darkness and Winthrop Woman. I loved these books when I was a teenager. I wish that a publisher would sell Anya Seton's books as a boxed set. A new generation of readers would appreciate her writing. No better author of historical fiction/non-fiction is out there. Anya Seton's books are no longer available in the library, so I came to Amazon to be pleasantly surprised that they are available! I would recommend these books to anyone, of any age. I first read Anya Seton as a teenager in a condensed Reader's Digest version (Winthrop Woman)and have been hooked ever since (at the age of 47 I am rediscovering her work again)."
1, Would recommend: This product has been great. I mix with other lotions and massage it into the sore areas.
0," magic rocks disappointed: Although the magic rocks did grow and we have no complaint with the set per se, our rocks spread all over the wall of the container and we were unable to see the rocks that looked nice and clean in the center.I tried to scrape the growth off the walls of the dish and all it did was crumble and fill the water with crumbles. By the time we were finished our set was just a messy glob of the magic rocks with only one or two nice rocks that happened to survive.I'm not sure, maybe we put too many rocks in the dish. ??? Regardless, ours didn't turn out very pretty in the end. Would like to try again...I can tell it does work, but I think it needs a larger container."
1," A scrapbooking investment: I bought this book as a gift for my sister-in-law and fellow scrapbooker. Well, after browsing through it quickly, I could not resist looking deeper and studying the ideas presented. Now I had to break down and buy my own copy. The ideas shown here, are so much more than your typical scrapbook page embellishments such as stickers, papers, frames and mats. This is how to make your photos into works of art. The techniques shown here make the pictures the center of attention. I find that when I do these kinds of pages, I get great results with just a simple hand drawn border.You may need to buy a few new tools to do these kinds of techniques, but I find this to be such an investment over buying more stickers, papers, etc. These pages really wow people, and once I made the initial investment, they are actually cheaper to do.I especially love the sections on mosaic pages, slicing pictures and using a photo to frame itself. This book is my all time favorite right now..."
1," Secrets: A sweet, but complex story! So many secrets to unfold! I can't wait to read the 2nd book in this series!"
1," Wonderful reading for all ages: This book is from an incredibly well written series starting with the original ""Redwall"" book. The ""formula"" is good against evil, loyalty and honor with only the glory of a job well done and the genuine gratitude that goes to those who stand up for what good and right no matter what the bad guys promise. Another tale in a not to be missed series of books for all-age readers"
0," Not Hallows Eve..., Imposters!!! Change the name of the band.: If you like such changes in a band that you wish that the band would just change their name(hi.. metallica, megadeth, soilwork, in flames, etc)then buy this sham...Wow! -I love Hallows Eve since 80's along with many others of that gnere... and quite a few newer ones following the fast and heavy tradition. I bought this album and just skipped through (ands skipped) songs, hopeing for the ""best one next"", they never came... Please trust me on this. I heard samples of their newer album...The Never Ending Sleep, this sounds a lot better than this P.O.S.!!!Trust me, buy this album, if you like everything that you have ever listened to, and have been constatly tweaking your head off, and huffing paint for years on end. If you like good metal then leave this one alone (you might like this if you were a huge 90's metallica fan though!!)."
0," Sustained Competitive Advantage?: Peter Senge wrote ""the only sustainable competitive advantage is to learn faster than your competition."" Hmmm, makes sense.Unfortunately in this book, the author is into buzzwords. The author does not explain how to build a sustained competitive advantage. But then again you already know that is not possible. Yes, you can have a competitive advantage in your supply chain - the problem is there is no reason that your competitors can't do the same thing ... so what is sustained? Just some more jive to take advantage of logistics concepts that are as old as Napoleon's army."
1," Permatex brake lube: I used this lube when rebuilding several calibers on two of my motorcycles (4 piston pots on each caliber). Its helps greatly with re-assembly and seems to keep the seals from any sticking. Its been at least 3 years since I've done the brakes, no problems what so ever, no seal swelling, highly recomended...As a side note, a previous poster mentioned how thick the lube is. Brake calibers, pistons, fluid will get very hot and will need a thicker grease that will not melt and get thown off.."
0," Where's the real first episode?: Shouldn't the first episode be the one where Richard tells us about his accident? The one that was a major part of his book that he wrote? I love the show, but it is frustrating to not have the full season available."
0," Not So Good Software: The most valuable thing in this software is the calculation of yardage. Otherwise, the drawing/tracing tools are difficult and inadequate and it's too difficult to import scanned images to add your own fabric to your sketchbook. Overall a clumsy software."
0," Worst Book for Children!: I'm really not sure how this book made it to publishing, there is no ""lesson learned"" in it other that being grumpy and wanting to fight - for no reason. I made the mistake of reading this to my 3 year old without pre-reading it first. It is curently in a recycle heap in our county."
1," value for money: I ordered the item purely on basis of cost and received it with 4 days which pleased me to start.Having read other reviews, I plugged it in to phone and computer with some trepidation and was delighted to see it worked perfectly immediately.Would recommend product and supplier to anyone."
1, Excellent conclusion to the Good Earth Trilogy!: This book was an easy read. It became clear early why Pearl Buck won the Nobel Prize in Literature for her work. She does a great job of developing the feelings of the characters and pulling you into their hopes and frustrations. I would have liked more divisions (a.k.a. chapters) but the novel felt well paced.
0," Very Disappointing: Asked for a new book, paid a new book price, but received something far from it. The book has clearly been read a few times. Dirty, Torn binding, creases in the outer cover, and what looks like Kool-aid stains on the pages. Delivery was slow as well. I am not happy."
0, IT CALLS THE POLICE ONCE A DAY BY ITS SELF: This phone calls the police all the time....one entry says once a month; more like 3 times a week. The local police department has threatend to press charges. I am currently working with samsung to get a phone upgrade....I went strait to Samsung and they told me to get bent and that it was a requested feature by T-mobile who told me to contact Samsung......
1, Wonderful Book: I read this book in one evening. I found it touching and remarkably insightful. I enjoyed each and every page.
1," Adequate & Easy to Install: Just purchased this last week and installed it the next day. Very simple installation and a good fit. It does what it says it does and is of adequate quality. Its worth the money, but my comments are:- Should have more velcro on the sides to make sure the sides of the screen don't become detached- Should have more magnets in the middle to make sure it snaps back into place (only 2 sets of magnets)- The bottom magnets aren't too strong and don't snap into place unless they gently touch together- Top opening is a little narrow"
0," Sizing is all wrong.: Tops too large, bottoms too small.Charter Club ""Cotton Candy"" Two-Piece Brushed-Back Satin Jacquard Pajama Set"
0, Blah: #1. This game only saves after completing a level. I just don't like any games I cannot instantly save. I have things to do and need to save and play later.#2. Space? Really? Lame motif for Mario#3. Angles and character movement is horrible. The depth perception in the game is lame. Way too time consuming for young kids to get the angles down whey they are jumping.#4. Why can't I play different views. It gets way to complicated not being able to zoom in/out and change the scope.
1," Fun Rhyming Book!: This is a fun book that describes, in rhyme, the adventures of a colorful hat (mauve with orange and yellow feathers and a brown band). After the wind blows this hat off its wearer all the way to a hay field, it is occupied by a spider and then a mouse, it's used as a basket and almost as a nest, and a puppy takes it on a romp. Eventually, the original owner finds it.This is a simple story told well, with imaginative rhymes and great sound effects:""Tut! Tut!"" clucked the farmer's wife when she sawthe crow in the hat with a nest out of straw.""SHOO! SHOO!fly away!"" the farmer's wife said.Then off she skipped with the hat on her head.The pictures, which look like pastes pieces of brightly colored papers are child-like and playful. This is illustrator Holly Meade's first book, and her work sweetly compliments the writing of the accomplished Nancy Van Laan. An excellent book for the infant/toddler set!"
1," Motivates to want to help your cause: I found this book more addictive the further I got into it. Going through the life of Mr. Mortenson's from the beginning of his search for his purpose in life (at the bottom), to his endless struggles with people trying to prevent the man from helping others, I found myself rooting him on. Throughout the whole book you cannot believe the problems that Mortenson goes through and he keeps coming back for more. I found that learning about the lives of the people in the small village in Northern Pakistan, that they had the environment that most people look for in a community. Even though they have no electricity, running water, or modern living places, they have family connections, human respect, and feeling of community that most look for. This book also show a good view of a Muslim community. The book made me want to pursue a life of helping the causes that I believe in."
1," SE FORMO UN VERDADERO KAOS!!!: Merengue, merengue y un poco mas de merengue. Este CD de Kaos esta super bailable. El productor del disco, director e integrante de Kaos lo es el Sr. Guillermo Torres, un excelente productor y cantante que tambien ha trabajado con artistas tales como Lourdes Robles, Rawy, Ashley ""La Chica Bomba"" y el grupo Velas, entre otros. Este fue el ultimo disco en que Charlie Masso (ex Menudo) trabajo como parte del grupo Kaos. Los mejores temas del disco son ""Desesperadamente"", ""Cinturita"" y ""La Bomba Encendia"" a duo con Ashley. Pero sin duda el mejor tema del disco lo es ""Tu"", un bolero en la voz de Charlie Masso. Este disco es lo mejor del grupo Kaos."
1," Love the show, love the book.: The show only covers a few chapters of the book, but the book is a comprehensive look at AC from the 20's to present."
0," Why is bigger always assumed to be better?: Wordy and digressive, I found this book both over-written and tedious reading. It lacks the focus of Turow's earlier books, seems an exercise in self-indulgence, much like The Big Chill"
0," Worst Media ever: Plays fine on the first layer. But picture will freeze during layer switch. I either have to stop or skip pass the chapter but picture will be jumping and pixellated, pretty much unwatchable.you have to skip at least couple chapter away from the layer switch to get a decent picture on your screen.don't waste your money. Buy verbatim instead. I never had any problem with that media."
0," Sacrilege! Not for die-hard Motown fans: I seldom ever write reviews about music but this could not go unspoken. The first cut on the CD which is Jackson Five's ""I Want You Back"" is ok, but then it's all down hill from there. As a Motown fan of the originals, I expected a contemporary mix to add some ""bump"" to the old tracks, but this is just crap, plain and simple. I almost the threw the disc out the window of my car where I first played it."
0," Rotten Apple. Pathetic.: My iPod has failed for the fourth time this year. This is simply a sickeningly, pathetically, embarrasingly unstable device. Apple should be ashamed with themselves. I shaln't buy another Apple product ... not out or spite/recrimination, it would simply be a waste of money and time. I hope that Apple have counted just how many customers they've lost by selling this tat."
1," Reminds me of Jamaica Kincaid: Soul Gardening reminds me of the rhapsodic gardening pieces of Jamaica Kincaid. What wonders await in this book. We are immersed into an extraordinary world, where God is in the details. It is a book for anyone who has ever stopped--or wanted to stop--and smell the roses."
1," Ginny and Philip are truly amazing: I read ""The Dog Who Rescues Cats"" a few years ago. Will I get hate e-mail if I admit I am not a dog lover AT ALL but adore cats? Well, Ginny is definately not your typical dog. She is absolutely incredible. I saw this book in a bookstore one day but didn't buy it. The title (and Ginny's unusual face) haunted me until I went back and purchased it. It was one of the best investments of my life. I adore Ginny and she's given me hope for other canines. I also enjoyed ""The Blessing of the Animals."" Philip, Sheila, and Ginny, what are you three up to now? How are the cats doing? Your loyal following needs an update!"
1, Great book: Love this book....easy read. A simple way to get away to another place and time. A must read. Share with a friend.
1," Falls short a bit though.: This album is mostly pretty good.Although a couple of tracks fall short a bit.A different but good direction in sound, by Bush."
0," Pablum about ""life"" dressed up as ""meaningful,"" disappointing story line: Sometimes an author makes things more meaningful by what he leaves unwritten than what he writes. This is not James Sallis' style in this book, and is why I do not recommend it. His main character, Turner, waxes philosophical about the gray areas of life, and comes off annoying rather than sympathetic or interesting. The plot holds great promise, but in the end also comes across as weak and as unsatisfying as a bag of Cheetohs on an empty stomach. I was disappointed. If you like detective fiction or are an afficionado of noir, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
1," sweet dreams mask: not only does this mask work, the company has the best customer service, thank you Rich!"
1," Great for already sharp knives: This sharpener is great for maintaining sharp knives, but I have been disappointed in its effect on my older knives. They improved some, but not to a honed edge. Perhaps I was expecting too much. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
0," Good to be aware of, even if you're a Trinitarian: This book is a comprehensive attack on Trinitarianism in the Bible (or a defence of Unitarianism in the Bible, whichever you like). From a Trinitarian viewpoint, Buzzard and Hunting are helpful if only for gaining an understanding of where my Unitarian (e.g. Jehovah's Witness) friends are coming from, though I remain unconvinced. If you're looking for something which comprehensively sets out the arguments for believing that God is not a Trinity, then this book will be helpful. Personally I gained a greater appreciation of how important it is that God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit through having my views challenged by this book."
1," The Spiritual and the Mundane: This is a wonderful first novel which expertly mixes the material and spiritual, using characters which are comical yet all too human. Mr. Suri writes with a style and understanding that is subtle and nuanced, yet achieves great depth. Despite its complexity, The Death of Vishnu is like a delicate perfume, light and provocative. Highly recommended."
1," Romulus is not to be missed: Romulus is one of the biggest hits of this sardonic Swiss playwright and novelist. Known in the USA only for The Viisit and the Physicists, Durrenmatt is one of this century's most brilliant theatrical lights. His works are informed by sardonic humor, beautiful language, intriguing plot twists, high suspense (he pot-boiled murder mysteries)and political insight. His essays are also interesting. Anything by him is going to be a good read."
1," Much more of a drama than comedy.: The Switch starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston turned out to be a pleasant surprise! This film got a lot of mixed reviews when it was released last summer but I very much enjoyed this warm, and introspective look at what makes a family...well, a family! Bateman gives a solid performance, his character plays it safe in life. He is slightly neurotic and is afraid to take chances. I liked Aniston in this film, she always wins me over with her spunk and wit. The Switch is a great, sweet film...check it out!"
0, poor steam production: This hairsetter just won't produce much steam. It is the 2nd one I've bought here. The first quit steaming at all. I guess the bargain...wasn't.
0," lcd cover, does not cover the full screen: I'm not using this... it will not cover completely my ipod touch's screen. I'm keeping the plastic that came with the ipod and buying a silicone case"
0," Cheap quality flag...I do not recommend: I am totally disappointed with these flags, so I sent them back. The photos on the website show heavy duty grommets and embroidered stars. You can even zoom on the photos and see that the portion of the flag with the grommets is a high quality material. I received the flags and got a PRINTED flag, with CHEAP grommets, and poorly sewn material. This flag should be recommended as INDOOR only....one good wind and this flag would not hold up. Totally disappointed and I think the website photos are a complete SCAM!!!! What a waste of time."
0," Better ways to waste a day: This is the sort of novel that makes you think that anyone can write a book. The characters are uninteresting, the plot falls flat after a mildly promising start, and the writing is relentlessly bad."
0," strained: I loved Tony Bennett's Duets II.....and the combination of voices betweenTony & K.D. Lang - was incredible. This CD however - A wonderful World,Tony sounds like he is straining to sing in several songs. K.D Lang's voicewas very minimal. IF her voice was more readily used, this could have beenincredible. It is NOT worth the money - but I will not return it. Not worth theprocess. Please - don't waste your money. When you listen to a portion providedhere - it is the smallest and best portion 0f the entire CD...."
0," I second the questionable accuracy!: The airport at Quito is not that wild...does it need some order, yes? Are people getting hit by police? NO! That is absurd.I find the story intriguing, but craziness like the airport story, locals not telling the police about guerrillas, and the mere fact that the spanish used in the book is atrocious. Vamos means ""Let's (we) go."" Not ""Vamoose"" like Yosimite Sam. Also, Joto is called Hoto many times...where was the editor? There are other ridiculous translations and misuse of Spanish. It did not seem to be intentional because when the oil workers used their spanish it fit the situation...the other misuses did not fit.If you want to read a kidnap tail...read this. If you want to read about the real Ecuador...go to another source."
1," Pleasantly Surprised!: I purchased this CD after reading one of the reviews. I have another Streetwize CD that I love, but I was a litter weary about getting this one (Jazz meets Dre and all). But I am glad I made the purchase, as I am thoroughly enjoying it."
0," Stay Away From This Recorder: I thought I had the best DVD Recorder yet, but despite the mostly New Raves over this product, it will stop recording toRegular DVD's when the Warranty runs out, I tried a second oneand got the same results, it won't play anything but DVD-Ram Now!Panasonic also did not send me a $50 Rebate that came with it.They sent me to a web site where it wasn't listed.JMO, This unit is great at first but don't through away Your VCR.Good luck to the rest of You."
0, We didn't like it.: We didn't like it. It wasn't comfortable. It was too small to give the back any support. We sent it back.
1," Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry: If you want a single book to learn how and why FT-IR spectrometers work, this is your best bet. I upgraded to the second edition because my first edition was falling apart after 20 years. I bought the print edition because I didn't like the way the Kindle edition displayed the diagrams, spectra, and other figures.The authors are highly-regarded practitioners and professors of applied spectroscopy, and they present a wide and deep enough scope of applicable technique to provide a great deal of useful reference material. It's a most useful book. If you want another single book to learn how to interpret FT-IR spectra buy ""Introduction to Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy"" by Colthup, Daly, and Wiberley, another one I have used for years."
1," perfect: perfectvery warmgood qualityvery good pricerecommended to every onebut one thinks about its, size medium so big and suit for large or x-large"
0," A musty period piece, smelling bad: Only its undeniable status as one of central relics of the Sixites (one that has held up as well as, say, the Nehru jacket) saves this dull, pretentious, massively over-rated film from the lowest rating. Maybe you had to be there, but I wasn't, and, judging from this, I'm not sorry."
0," Pretty, but don't look too closely: Seller's e-mail notifications, on-time delivery, etc. were very good. The product itself was a disappointment - low quality. The glass Christmas ornaments I received have a somewhat dull / slightly ""flaky"" (not smooth, consistent) finish with a subtle but noticeable ""line"" where the two glass halves have been ""glued""/fused (?) together. The box, upon delivery, was also slightly crushed at one corner although the ornaments did not break. The ornament box (not the shipping box) is fairly flimsy and cannot be used for storage between Christmases."
1," BOWING OUT WITH GRACE: 2 great tracks weighing in at just over 6 minutes each. The tracks here are far more focused and concentrate on building up. There are no vocals (which I kind of prefer, although Slint's narration style vocals are great), the music is very fuzzed out and is reminiscent of a more punked out Explosions In The Sky.Some say this is their best work. I say it is among their best work. If the tracks where longer and more developed, with a higher degree of build up / release, then 5 stars would have been awarded. For the price and considering its still available, you should get this right away as no Slint fans or post-rock fans would be let down.p.s at the end of the last track their is a buzzing drone for about 30 seconds with the music slowly dying in the background. This part can really fcuk with ones head when high."
0," Boris is a billion times boring.: Pretty simple, this film is boring. I stuck with it and watched until the end, but no redemption whatsoever. I like many movies from this era, and am very patient with story lines. Having said that, I gave it the usual chance after chance, and even thought having Lee Grant might possibly save this one, but no. I can't think of any reason to recommend it."
1, Red Wings Watch: Watch was a described. Delivery was very quick. Size adjustment of band was simple. My husband is a big Wings fan and really loved this watch.
1, Good textbook for simulation: Teach how to use Arena to do simulation in details. Present so clearly that anyone can enter the simulation world easily.
1," The nightmare is back!!!!!!: I have been a huge fan of the Halloween series. They are all great. That is why I cant wait for the 8th! But here is a twist for you to catch, Micheal may not have been the killer in H20! Or I bet that there was to killers in H20 and Micheal was not the man who was decapitated. I will go see it the first day it comes out! If you are a fan of horror movies, go see this!"
1, Kinda messy: I knew I was getting an oil and I wanted it because of that but it tells you to put it on thick. I did that but it was too much oil. I was very greasy and had a hard time putting my bra on! I would recomend either using it just in the evenings or not quite so thick. Rub it in good. Maybe get a masseuse to use it!
1," Pricey...But You Definately Get What You Pay For!: If you've got to have the very top of the line, then you have to get this bundle. With it's dual processors, huge hard drive, and one of the best displays that you can get for Mac or PC, this is the ultimate bundle.One of the greatest features of this bundle is the included DVD burner. Along with the iDVD software (which comes with this,) it's the perfect way for both ametuer and professional video makers to create DVDs with ease.And this bundle also includes Apple's popular iMovie and iTunes software, along with the new OS X.1.There are only two things that keep this bundle from being have a five star rating. One, it's a little pricey. Two, the 17"" display is beautiful, but it can't hold a candle to the 22"" widescreen display that Apple has.Still, if you are home video maker, or editing video professionally, you can't get much better than this set."
0," What a headache!!!: This thing is a tangles nightmare! The all-black color makes it nearly impossible to straighten out too. Don't try to put it on a load alone - you will almost certainly give up (or go blind trying)! Construction is very sturdy but the design is insane. Don't buy - this is a waste of money. Just get some rope and criss-cross your load a few times ... much, much easier to do, especially by yourself. I wouldn't have given it even one star but Amazon insisted."
0," Cant say for sure...: Basically, they worked while I was sucking on one. But it felt like a jolly rancher or especially sour apple rings worked the same if not better...I dont think anything would of worked for me at that time in my life. Maybe for mild nausea this product would be better but not for severe nausea."
1, great beginner video: Very explanative as to how to perform the moves. Really leaves nothing to guess work
1," Even better than Playstation, and that is saying something!: First, to start out, this Game is possibly the most addicting, fun, and best games to ever be made by Midway, for N64. The graphics are fenominable!!! I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I was on that game for 4 hours, before I finally switched of the game and did something else. It is a very long game, but it is worth the time and effort. Unlike most games you are cooperating with up to 3 other people on the SAME screen. No stupid split screens. You work together and share items, gold, food, (for health), and other things. An absolute blast for parties! NO, I repeat, No adventure game collection is complete without this game. Choose between a wizard, a valkyerie, an archer, or warrior, (I prefer wizard myself), and choose between four colors, (blue red green or yellow, I prefer green). My verdict; BUY IT BEFORE IT'S TO LATE!!!"
0," Not what I expected: I was looking for a book on how to establish healthy boundaries in everyday situations such as work and family. Specifically I was looking for positive ways to say no without ruffling feathers.I read about two thirds of this book and put it down because it is really geared towards women who can't say no to men's advances. Much of the content deals with abuse and incest.While this may be helpful to some, the title and description of this book were misleading to me."
0," Not for me: The application leaves a little to be desired, it didn't control odor so well and it broke me out. I don't recommend this product."
1," Simply Excellent!!!!!!: When this album first came out I thought this will never be as good as Trash, how mistaken I was. From the opening song I knew this album was going to be a cracker. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this album for any Hard Rock fan. Trust me, this is one of the best Hard Rock Albums ever."
0, Motorola Dual Slot Rapid Desktop Charger has problems: I have returned my chager to Motorolla under warranty two times. Each time Motorolla customer service was very nice about replacing it however the rear pocket for charging batteries has never worked. I've tested it with three batteries - 2 Li ION and 1 NiMH and it doesn't work with any in the rear pocket. It acts like its charging the battery but does not. The front pocket does a fine job of holding the phone and I haven't had trouble with the back holding the battery. If it worked it would be worth owning.
1, A good value: Do you have a big bird lover? I had been looking for a plush that was larger than a bean bag... And finally found it on here! Super soft other than the beak... Our little one loves it.
0," Nice Keyboard, But...: buyer beware, as other's have mentioned already, this keyboard does not ship with the IR receiver, the IR receiver only comes with the MS Media Center remote control. And this is an IR based setup, meaning you have to be able to point the Keyboard at the receiver or it doesn't work.At the time of my initial purchase, I did not have the MC remote; so I had to buy that as well (extra $34.00+shipping).At the time of my purchase, I had read the reviews about the joystick/mouse button being ""stiff"" and it would loosen up after a while, but on the board I purchased this never happened, as such this was unuseable for me and I had to find a wireless keyboard that had a trackball instead.My next purchase was for this keyboard:""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJM7S0/ref=oss_T15_product""its radio based and has a trackball, this has been a dream since I installed it. Granted it doesn't have the nifty Media Center buttons, but that's fine; this is a simple wireless board that works."
1," Life-saver for second baby!: We have a 3-year old and 2-month old, and this tent has been a lifesaver for our active family! We take it to the park, pool, outdoor concerts, etc. We purchased the Eddie Bauer Infant Travel Bed to put in it, and our baby takes her wonderful long naps while we enjoy life with her along side us. This has been one of the best investments we've made to make life with a second baby ""livable"". We love our CABANA, and recommend it to all of our friends!!!"
0," Should last more than 2 months, but it didn't.: This looked like a great product, but unfortunately, after three or four uses in less than 60 days, it stopped working. It has a one year warranty, so we'll be sending it back to the manufacturer. This means we won't have it to use. We'll see how they honor their warranty and how fast we get one back.Service is everything with a dud product."
1, Great for kids: Bought this for my son in his first season of kid-pitch. It helps to alleviate some fear of getting beaned in the mellon. It is very easy to install and you can put in on their next helmet too. Seems pretty indestructable.
1," excellent pen: The pen is great, I have no complaints with it at all, its everything I expected. It writes smooth & feels good in hand. The price for it was unbeatable also."
0, Poor product from Sennheiser = hissing sound...: Plenty of hissing sounds are heard however I adjust the tuning and change transmitter frequency.Very short range (~ 4-6 feet) and only works with direct line of sight in front of transmitter (surprising for RF!).Will return item to Amazon.
0, cheap but not good: It is cheap but not good. I am not using it any more but I didn't bother to return it either.
1," A landmark work on the theory of interest: First of all I appreciate the publisher's efforts to make this great book available in printed version. In this monograph we can find many important ideas, such as income streams and net present value (Ch. I), Fisher equation (Ch. II), intertemporal choice of consumption (Ch. IV), rate of return over cost (Ch. VII), term structure of interest rates (Ch. IX), and many others. These ideas have laid the foundation of modern macroeconomics and financial theory. Besides, John Maynard Keynes had adopted Fisher's idea of the rate of return over cost (he called the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) in his General Theory (Ch. 11)) to formulate his own theory of interest, though later misrepresented by John Hicks' IS-LM which oversimplified the idea of Keynes. All in all, after 83 years since its first publication in 1930, this book is still among the best books ever written on the subject of interest, and is very much worth reading."
1, Championship Team Building: What Every Coach Needs to Know t: I am both an experienced girls basketball coach as well as a psychiatrist. I HIGHLY recommend this book to coaches of any team. The strategies are effective and important. It can be easy to overlook importance of the mental aspect of athletic performance. Mr. Janssen does an excellent job of clarifying the role coaches have in this aspect of the game and gives practical advice on how to acheive better team performance.
1," PHIL, PLEASE COME BACK: Ok, i am a diehard GENESIS fan, whatever ever they do, however they grow, i can take it, pre-Collins Genesis & post-Collins alike. I am more disapointed that Genesis called it quits after this than i am that phil left. I LOVED PHIL IN GENESIS, but Ray Wilson is ok, i guess they figured that support in England meant nothing if they didn't have America, so they quit. When Peter left, they said, ""we are still good, let's continue"" but i guess now they've got enough money so they don't have to go on, a shame. Now as for the songs, Wilson's voice is good, and so are the drums. The best songs to me are the title track, Dividing Line, Not About Us, (the Hold On My Heart copy:) If That's What You Need, Congo,Shipwrecked and Small Talk (despite it's annoying parts) I guess if Genesis won't carry on with Ray Wilson, will Phil please come back?also receommended:Genesis: We Can't DanceGenesis: Seconds Out (almost a ""hits live"" at that point)Genesis: Lamb Lies Down On BroadwayGenesis: Live"
1," Great clean fun; brought back memories of a wholesome upbringing...on the West coast...: I'm old enough to remember this when it came to the theater; for awhile my daughter couldn't find this on DVD, so I was so glad to get it, finally. Our family hardly watches the trashy programs on network TV, so we are still accumulating ""classics"" to watch when we have downtime. Tony Randall is the perfect actor for this part! The casting was great overall. I highly recommend this for anyone who do Not need skin, explosions, blood and profanity to be entertained. Oh, and Debbie Reynolds worked pretty well with that hog!"
0," DVD was not playable.: Apparently, different countries have different codes in a DVD player. I thought all DVDs were the same. I was so excited to get the movie, but so disappointed I could not play it. It would've cost the price of the movie just to ship it back, so I just had to throw it out. That was a waste of money."
0," terrible: This is a terrible foam roller, if you can even call it that. It came in a trash bag and has the consistency of a water noodle you use in the swimming pool. It was bent when it arrived so that makes it hard to ""roll."" I used it probably 10 times and it already has an indention in the middle. And I weigh 125 so its not bc I'm fat. And now that I've wasted my money, I get to go buy a better product."
1," Wonderful!: Wonderful true scent!! I bought these to carry in my purse, so I'll never be without my favorite Ombre Rose. Works great!"
1, Good for my GL1800: I put this on the front of My '08 GL1800. It's holding up fine after 7k miles. Would buy again.
0, AVOID: This was a monster of a machine. It was difficult to thread and would bunch thread coming up from the bobbin. I'm pretty mechanically inclined and just could not solve the problem.I eventually replaced with a low end Brother machine and have been happily sewing ever since.
0," Rusted, Broke: After a few times through the dishwasher these rusted inside the handle and then separated from it. To be fair, I'm not sure if putting these in the dishwasher is suggested or not, but I would have expected them to last longer."
1," Great read!: A slow start, but it still held my interest due to the characterization and how well written it is. Not really a sword and sorcery fantasy tale, and not a grand epic(I mean that in a good way- it's a more personal tale and it is wrapped up very completely in this novel). The protagonist, Cazaril, is an interesting and complex character, but definitely not an invicible warrior. I empathized with Caz throughout his journey, and enjoyed the philosophical and theological struggles that accompany his many challenges.If you've liked other books by this author, you'll probably like this one a lot. A better tale than her prior fantasy novel ""The Spirit Ring"", imho.Fun, compelling, and thoroughly enjoyable."
0," ""BETTER WATCH OUT, THIS MOVIE STINKS"": I would say this is the worst in the Silent Night series. It has a lame story of Ricky surviving and is now in a coma who encounters a blind girl with E.S.P who can tap into his thoughts. If you think that sounds strange and quite stupid its because it is,this movie is unintentionly funny with the character Ricky wearing what looks to be a bowl of some sort on his head(reminds me of something from the kitchen)and Ricky is played by a different actor from the previous which I thought would be good news since the last Ricky was terrible,but this Ricky is just as bad. This movie is slow-paced and flat out boring. SKIP THIS AND TRY TO GET A COPY OF THE CLASSIC(1984/SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT)INSTEAD OF PART 3 WHICH IS NOT EVEN WORTH A FREE RENTAL!"
0," A whiny, reptitious, disappointment: I heard Ms Brook sing one of her songs on 103.1 in LA. That cut alone made me buy this album. Unfortunately, that song was not on this, her latest, CD. That Ms Brook is talented is not in question. Unfortunately her musical choices on this CD are mainly whiny, repititious and uninteresting. I could barely get through one listening. A major disappointment."
0," Imagination meets ridiculousness: When imagination fulminates too hard, it turns into drivel and this author got to that point. I guess ""god satires"" aren't for everyone, but it all seemed like a sophomore essay in a land where the sophomores have hairy tails and ears and mark trees to denote their territory. James Morrow has marked his territory and now I don't want to go into that area of the forest."
1," I know why the caged bird sings: I wonder if this book credits poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar who wrote the poem titled ""Sympathy"" which contains the phrase ""I know why the caged bird sings"". For those who have not read the poem that Maya Angelou refers to I would highly recommend it."
0," Don't waste your time: I got this product today and it is already boxed up to go back to Amazon. It wouldn't get an IP address and after hours of trying and talking to tech support, I gave up. Couple this wither other bad reviews, don't waste your time or money.This product over-promises and just plain doesn't deliver.There might be something better somewhere but this multifunction print server is terrible. Don't say you weren't warned! I ignored the other bad reviews to try it anyway, my mistake!Also as an update, I forgot to add the fact that the Installation CD that came with it was defective. I tried it in multiple drives and it was bad disc."
0, Horrible: The sides will not lock and it was hard to put together. I would not recommend this product
1," Facinating: Bought it for my wife but I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Meryl Streep is, as usual, fantastic. Special features on disc are enlightening."
0," Useless for Designer Forms: I bought this specifically for information about using the new LiveCycle Designer application that comes with Acrobat Professional to create interactive PDF forms. All of the information in this book (Chapters 26-29) is wrong about that app--none of the dialog boxes match, or are even close, and the program doesn't work the way it's described. I'm guessing that Adobe changed it after the book was written."
1," Holocaust Dachau-Sachsenhausen: Very informative. I already knew the history, but I wanted a record of it. I am trying to collect all Holocaust DVDs I can to keep arecord for posterity. When I die I will donate them to my synagogue. I'm trying to find a DVD on Treblinka, but have not found one yet.Thanks."
0," This movie really sucks: this movie really sucked, i don't know why anyone would buy or rent it but it was given to me on accident. the special effects could have been better done by a small child. i am fairly sure they used a cap gun in all the shootings, the acting was horrible, i have seen grade school plays that were far more impressive. don't buy or rent this movie!"
0," loose fitting: I find these shoes to be slightly larger than the size indicated causing a looser fit than I desire and this problem is compounded by the fact that the spring in the cinch tab is not as strong as needed to hold the laces tight. Walking no more than 100 feet causes the laces, and therefore shoes, to become uncomfortably loose. If I had not mistakenly discarded the box, I would have returned the shoes."
0, Quality of diaper decreasing as years go by: I have been purchasing these diapers since Sept. 09 and the thickness of the diapers have been decreasing over time. When I first purchased the diapers they were heavy weight - now they are like thin cheesecloth. I called Gerber only to be told the diapers have been the same for many years and I was the only Mom who complained on the quality control of the diaper. I was extremely disappointed with their response and their product. Its sad when a company doesn't acknowledge the truth.....
0, not for Itouch and FM only marginal: I bought this to use with a new itouch. The connector fits but the itouch won't charge. This unit is incomptible. The fm transmission is also poor. There is a lot of static on the radio. It is also not returnable. All around a throwaway. Hope you have better luck.
1," Awesome Performance!: While we will probably never know for sure just what transpired in the final days in the bunker, this film gives as acurrate a portrayal as possible.Based on the memories of his secretary, this film delves into the nuances of the panic ridden final days of the Reich.The betrayal of some of his generals, the suicides of those who fervently believed to the end, and the chaos of Berlin. Bruno Ganz is outstanding in his portrayal of the Furher.Even down to the shaking hand due to Parkinson's disease, he is faithful to the behavior and character of one of the most evil men of the 20th century. I highly recommend this film."
1," A Very Good Prayer Guide: This book aids in supporting and teaching how to pray specifically on certain issues, helps in showing you how to pray and get your prayers answered. Recommend highly."
1," Works Great!: A solid and reliable solution with the variable temperature and cooling functionality needed to insure multiple applications and longer service life than other like models on the market - without the higher costs of the supposed higher-end units that sell for much more. The bottom line is it's easy to handle, gets the job done, and doesn't break the bank in the process."

1," Great and Cheap: great balls, came really fast so i could actually use them this weekend (hopefully, if i get enough guys together) actually aren't ""assorted"" colors. don't know if they screwed up my order or what but i got 2000 shrapnel brand paintballs. seem fine to me, don't see any dents and looked like only 1 broken ball out of the bunch. can't ask much more for less than $30 hope they shoot alright but i got a 98C so it wouldn't matter even if they did suck 8)p.s. don't know if this is the sellers fault or amazon's: the day i was notified that the paintballs had even shipped, i received them later the same day and i don't live anywhere near these guys.also once i shoot some of these i'll adjust my rating. (they get 4 out of 5 due to fast shipping and the balls look good so far)"
1, Stuart Gordon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5KUMO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imIf you are not familiar with Gordon's work you should be. This was a great H.P. Lovecraft adaptation .
0," Don't waste your $$$: Terrible product by Sony. Yes the picture is great, but it doesn't outweigh the hassle of >2 minute warmup time, flimsy remote, extremely poor upscaling and very few bells and whistles (didn't even have 'time left' feature).Spend your hard earned cash on the new BDP-S350. Same price, half the size, better picture, easier navigation, minimal warmup time, etc.Mine is running on a 52"" Sony Bravia and it is incredible!"
1," If you like the FDNY, if you want to know its History, this is the book!: This book from start to finish is packed with information that you would otherwise never have heard about. The history of one of the most famous Fire Depts in the US is more than I ever imagined, naming some of the early firefighters who would have otherwise slipped into the sandglass of time. The accounts of fires and incidents in the citys history do more credit than you will ever hear about anywhere else. It shows why today Firefighters of the modern day FDNY fight so hard to keep hold of their history and tradition. Before you make judgement on these guys read this book. This is what they are all about."
1," Alan Moore being Alan Moore: Alan Moore's LoEG, V1 is NOTHING like the movie, and that is a very good thing. Of course the same basic characters are there, but that is where the similarities stop. As my title suggests, this is another example of Alan Moore's ability as a writer and story teller. This volume, along with its sequel, are fantastic reads and are worth the money I paid for them. The story, dialogue, and art all fit together perfectly and there was never a moment I was not entertained. Perfect for any fan of Alan Moore or Graphic Novels in general."
0," A rather tawdry and incorrect biography: I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Betty Grable. Unfortunately, this book has many inaccurate facts and gives a tawdry view of one of most well liked and respected stars of early Hollywood. Perhaps some day someone will write an accurate biography with interviews from her family, friends and co-workers."
1," It's decent for a cheap point and shoot: I typically shoot with digital SLRs and wanted a decent point and shoot that was small, cheap, and had decent image quality. This camera is small, cheap, and has... good enough image quality. It's touted as having great low-light capabilities, but the quality at ISO 1600 and ISO 2000 is crap. Other than that, it suffers from the same problems that just about every camera in this class does: very little manual control, no RAW, etc.Don't get me wrong: I really like this camera. I think I just have a chip on my shoulder about the state of the point and shoot market. If you want a point and shoot, this is a very good one. If you pre-focus, the shutter is remarkably responsive. The video quality is pretty good. While ISO 1600 may be noisy, ISO 400 is better than most P&S; cams."
1, Amazone purchased product. Works well: A really good video which is easy to follow. It does make a difference. I am not near as stiff as I was when I began using the video.
1," GOOD: This movie does what Transformers - The Movie did. It takes a good series with a lot of characters, and extends it to nearly two hours. In the process, it allows access to many MORE characters at the same time, a more involved plot, a larger geographic scale, some history, and an overall mature feel. There were personal tragedies, character flaws, and even a court martial. I enjoyed this movie because it took a familiar series and said ""ok, what if we want to make something just a LITTLE more serious?"" For those who are worried by this review, also be assured that their are MANY homages to the familiar series, that will satisfy even the most seasoned viewer (like me.) Oh, and the producers did not shirk on the all-star voices, either. :)"
0," Senseo Extra Large Reservoir: I suppose it could just be faulty and I should send it back, but I have decided that by the time I've payed the shipping costs again that it would not be cost effective. The problem is that if you fill it up over the two cup line, the water leaks out -ALL OVER YOUR COUNTER. Twice I found the machine sitting in a massive pool of water. I never fill it up more than half way and I always empty it as soon as I am done. And yes, it does defeat the purpose."
1," Zen of S&M: It is a good book to meditate on. To notice ones thinking and how one might judge things. I found Story of O a great book for disciplining my etiquette and manners. I also liked how Pauline Reage wrote, she got the idea across in proper etiquette. The book had a unique romantic nature about it that many books lack. The ending is a bit odd although, but still a good book to introduce one into the subject of S&M. I suggest anyone who needs discipline of any sort read this book."
0," Just doesn't work: I even sent mine for repair and received a replacement. If you use the document feeder with copy, fax, or scan option, images are distorted. Most of the time, it prints smudges on envelopes. Sometimes, it just doesn't print the entire document. Often will not print on label sheets"
0," help: i swear i heard a song with Charlie Tuna (from Jurassic 5) in this movie. If anyone out there know what i'm talking about, please let me know. i really want to know what song that was."
0," Wow - a really mean book: Hmmm, where do I begin. I guess the title just about says it. I remember seeing Al Franken on the old SNL, he seemed like a happy, normal guy. Unfortunately he must have changed since then.He's not happy or funny, more often just very mean and nasty. I can't believe I read this book looking to get a laugh. Extremely disappointed. I think the idiot anyone who buys this book. Don't do it!"
1," Excellent - Informative - Easy: This book made me the Alpha dog in my pack. Training techniques may change but dogs don't. They are still pack animals and respond on that level. I have used the Alpha Wolf Roll Over technique successfully on several pups. Would I try it on a snarling, full grown dog? Of course not, but when used in combination with the other tips and techniques, it can be very helpful to let a young dog who is challenging your authority understand your seriousness. My in-law's cockerspaniel was a snotty little pup always trying to nip at peoples faces. I gently, but firmly used the alpha wolf roll over, he promptly peed in submission and stopped the annoying behavior. Give this book a chance to help you understand how your dog thinks and responds."
1," Tarantino masterpiece: Written by QT in 3 weeks, this tight drama revolves around a botched robbery you never see on screen, and don't need to. It's all about the character reaction after the fact. Nice, plausible twist at the end. You need this in your collection."
0, Bad quality product. I can't get it to work at all....stay away....: This is a very bad product don't order it. It never finish to charge. Only has about 90% of the specified capacity. After a discharge refuses to charge again. When discharging jumps from 30% to 0% and the Notebook turns off whit out any warning...Don't buy this thing
0," Poorly Thought Out Book: Politics Lost is a poorly thought out book. It purports to be a stunning muckraking work, yet it is nothing more than a critigue of the aesthetics of power in Washington.Critics such as Klein have long seen advertising as being a negative force in politics at least since the Eisenhower campaign hired an advertising agency in 1952. Klein claims that since the Nixon campaign of 1968, politics have become nothing more than slickly packaged advertisements.Klein's book is really nothing more than the same old, same old."
0," Not a machine that will last: This was a great product for the 4 months in which I was able to use it. You mix up your ice cream, pour it in, and hit 2 buttons. One for the machine, and one for the mixer. A dream come true.However, after 4 months of use mine has stopped working. It simply does not cool anymore. Do not let this happen to you!If you value a machine that will last, then this is not the machine for you."
0," Useless for Uni Students: The content of this book may be good, but the Kindle version is less than useless. The Table of Contents does not work and there is no 'proper' pagination of the Kindle version - just the beyond annoying 'location' numbers. As a student, this renders it totally useless as I am unable to use the 'book' in my footnotes - need page numbers.This is an issue with many Kindle ebooks that really needs to be addressed - and quickly!!"
1," Good value Subwoofer: Although I've auditioned various subwoofers in the stores, this is my first. So I'm not an expert in low frequency speakers. But I am pleased with the performance of the Polk 505. I don't want the base to overwhelm the music or the soundtrack but I also want to notice that it is there. At the 25-30% of volume level and it does what I want. Since the subwoofer has such a narrow range of frequency and the difference between this and other subs that I've heard in 600-800 price range were negligible to my ears, I preferred to spend more money on the quality of the front and rear speakers and the price on the 505 allowed me to do just that."
1, Cute little battery eater.: Very Cute! My 1 yr old enjoys seeing it go all over. The plastic can scratch but has not yet broken...so it's fairly durable as my 4 yr old tosses and drops it often. The only down side is that it has no timed auto shut off so it will run until the battery dies if no one turns it off.
1," Well worth the price!: I saw this item in the Gold Box deal section. I looked at it just wondering why it costed almost $40. I was surprised to hear that the top slots were 2"" wide. This is a very good-sized unit. I added it to my cart, and also after checking its dimensions, I also picked up from Amazon aWhitmor 6054-585 Supreme Wide Stacking Shelf, Chrome(note: the one measuring 14""x15""x15"", not the wide one). The Whitmor shelf fits *perfectly* over the Safco organizer. Between these two products, I have organized my workspace tremendously.As far as the Safco itself, I find the build quality to be above average, definitely exceeding expectations. It's much sturdier than similar fare I've seen in office supply stores. This product was well worth the cost, and turned me on to Safco. I will definitely consider their other products based on the quality of this organizer."
0," Possible solution for dropped connections: I had both the whole unit stop working and the strange wireless connection freezes. I have this gateway and the solution to the dropped connections and lock ups was to put a very small fan blowing on the router. It's possible that it's an overheating problem, even when the room is relatively cool. I read about the possible overheating problem somewhere, and my connection has been completely solid 24/7 for several months since I put the fan on it. Before that, it was dropping the connection daily and required pulling the power plug to reset the connection.This product was given to me by Comcast when I ordered the Home Networking option.The connection IS much better now with this modem than it was before with my own store-bought cable modem, but that is not saying much.In summary: This unit sucks, don't buy it - and I like Netgear products.If this review helps you with your problem, please bump it (click on 'Yes' it was helpful)"
1," The Handbook of Groundwater Engineering: A very conscientious textbook. The book covers a great deal of information including the occurrence of groundwater, groundwater flow, modeling, testing, geostatistics, solute transport, GIS, and remediation. The subject matter is complemented by tables, data, and graphs. which help explain key concepts and the mathematical equations used. I like to use this in conjunction with Handbook of Hydrology. A very good book for the practising professional."
0," Lock cut : Bike stolen: while I was at work my bike was stolen while it was LOCKED using this bike lock. No, the criminal didn't figure out my combination, nor did I forget to lock it; the thief took a tool and straight up cut it. It was clean cut; doesn't look like much effort was taken in wrangling the lock in two. Just a clean swipe and my bike was gone. I recommend something else. Anything else."
0," Truly a horrible movie: One of the worst movies I've seen. Dialogs are slow and every single performance is emotionless. I did not build any kind of sympathy towards Rip Torn's character or his wife. Yeah, you do get a sense that she's lonely, you do get a sense that he is a has-been still living the life of the rich and famous and you do see his somewhat distant son get it on with his mother-in-law. But might as well read it here as you'll feel no emotion whatsoever finding it out in the movie. The music is the only thing that spares it from being terrible.This movie is ranked right at the bottom of my list along with Van Sant's Last Days. People seem to overrate these pieces of film waste just because they're different. But my God, you can be different and good, entertaining and thought-provoking.DO NOT BUY OR RENT!"
0," Lasted a few days: This is a really cute little jewelry box, but the dancer and latch broke in no time at all. The box is still intact so that's good. My 5-year-old daughter is very careful with her things, but after a few minutes the wings popped off the ballerina and then a little while later the whole girl came out. I was really hoping this would last longer than it did."
1," Excellent gloves: After spending a whole lot more on drug-store gloves, these are great. Much better value, very strong, they don't leave any residue on your hands... couldn't be better."
1," Possibly too dark...: If you come looking for a simple, happy set of tunes, don't! This time Massive Attack have teamed up with Sinhead O'Connor, whacky Irish artist, and in places it becomes downright depressing. It can be a grower, but if you want to get into Massive Attack, do it chronologically!"
1," Awesome movie: I have been a follower of Stephen Hunter's books for a long time. This adaptation of his book really hit the mark. Rarely do movies do books justice, but this one did a really good job. I highly recommend the Bob Lee Swagger series of books as well. Great entertainment value."
0," Waste of Time: Low budget films have a place in this world. Some are really good! This one was not.It was awlful, boring, poorly acted, horrible soundtrack and a plot that was both confusing and very thin.Dont waste a dime on this. In fact if you want to buy a blue ray I will sell it cheap. I promise only watched once!!!"
0," Another average album: I'm always amazed when I see people who talk about being die-hard train fans or that train is one of their top 5 favorite artists. Their music, by and large is just garbage. Both of their previous albums had exactly one song worth listening to (Meet Virginia, Drops of Jupiter) and this album is little different. The popular radio hooks are Calling All Angels and When I Look to the Sky, both of which have similarities to their past radio singles in the somewhat catchy beat with lyrics that rhyme but have little meaning. Train is definitely a product of radio airtime, with very little redeeming value musically. And the overproduction on this latest album is more than I can stand.If you have to buy the album, Lincoln Avenue and Following Rita are two of the more listenable songs along with the other two I mentioned. Not worth buying and album just for these songs though."
0," Not for running!: I bought this harness for my 75 pound psycho-dog after a prong collar and gentle leader failed to stop the pulling. It seems to work okay if she's not too hyper and if we're just walking, but don't use it for running with your dog unless your dog will run beside you! (And in that case, why use a harness at all?) My dog goes nuts when we run and she pulls me so hard I was hoping this harness would make it so she couldn't pull me and we could just go for a nice easy run. Instead she pulled as hard as she usually would and this harness rubbed holes in her legs! She was screaming and barking (moreso than she usually does from the excitement of running) and I thought it was just from frustration of not being able to pull me but when we came inside I noticed the front of her legs were rubbed raw! I won't be using this harness for running anymore. Unfortunately I don't know what else to try. Also it's really hard to fit this thing to your dog properly. Good luck!"
1," Great!!: I have been in the financial services business for 20 years, and have not ever read anything so ""right on"" as this book!It captures the essence of what all financial planners should teach their clients, but next to none do.It is a must read for not only laymen but also for the people in the business that profess to be doing the right things for their clients.Excellent job, Jarvis and Mandell"
1, Nice lens for the price: I've had this for a couple of months now and I have liked the results so far. Been doing a lot of indoor sports photography (lacrosse and swimming) and once I got used to the limitations of the lens (small aperture) I am getting very good results for a lens in this price range. Autofocus is fast and pictures are sharp. Looking forward to outdoor sports this summer!
1," A Quirky Mystery: A wonderful quick read, murder that happend or did it? A Bumbling set of fiends who are trying to save each other. Detectives falling over themselves. Mix it all together and we have you laughing, crying, and wanting to punch someone in minutes. Ms Holman keeps us on our toes trying to decide what next. A light mystery sprinkle with a hint a abuse. Looking for a little fun this is the book for you."
1," Classic: There was a riot going on in 1968, and it was called Vincebus Eruptum. Hendrix may have fused volume with blues and jazz, and the MC5 may have staged a punk insurrection. But no one rocked harder than Blue Cheer.""Summertime Blues"" turns Eddie Cochran's rockabilly into a mosh frenzy. ""Out Of Focus"" is a head in the vice fever dream, and ""Rock Me Baby"" may have been the heaviest take on the blues in rock yet.Blue Cheer were not the kids marching, or going to college. They were the guys that would have worked in a machine shop, smoked lots of weed, drank lots of beer, and grown their hair, stedily. This was music for the kids in the steel towns, doomed to factory jobs, and the songs punched as hard as these kids could,No politics, no protest, no power flowers. This is heavy metel before metel was heavy. GET IT."
1, Who's Watching the Watchmen?: One of the Greatest reads that I have enjoyed. A Graphic Novel masterpiece. A masterfull piece of writting and illustration that gives strength to the Genre. This cemented Alan Moore as one of my Favorite writers.
1," Get help for this PS2 release!!!: If you're one of the lucky people who managed to walk home with a Playstation 2, good for you. I think Summoner is one of the best RPG's so far for PS2, and the numerous mini-quests and countless items are what people will most likely need to refer to the guide book for. This book has a lot of combat strategies and there's no denying that Summoner's battle system is very deep, engrossing, and a little complicated at times. This guide doesn't spoil the plot at all, and all people can get a lot of help from the guide"
1," You can tell he's a lawyer because...: he loves to hear himself speak! Mr. Spence's book drones on with too many poetic examples and too many opinions on evil corporate types. The premise and the actual information is fantastic, however. This is once and if you can get through the sermons and stories. A MUST read for those who live and die by persuasion or argument"
1," This is the Real Deal!!!: This dvd series is off the chain! I ordered it expecting to see some hot women but got so much more. The women on this series are incredible, I mean asses like butter and pretty faces, its like watching a music video and seeing those fine ass girls in real life. I really enjoyed this because not only do you get to see these beautiful women but you also get to find out about the cities and the nightlife. I'm definitely booking a trip down to Brazil. After seeing this, I may not want to come back!!!"
1," A Good Book: First off let me say that I bought my copy from Larry Hupp himself. I used to work with him and were friends. I am currently only on page 35 but form what I have read it has been a very good book. That is why I have given the book 4 stars, because Im not very far into it. The opening will grab you right off the bat, and then the story begins. I will have to say that if you are a fan of the Left Behind series you will like this novel."
0," Don't get this, buy the Circo version instead: This is a great toy, however, as another reader states, Melissa & Doug failed terribly in the container, and it IS important!!!There are so many little pieces that, you want to keep them in a container you can close, otherwise it is a real pain, trust me.I found a much better version of this toy, made by Circo (I believe this is a Target brand), the doll is nicer, there are more pieces of clothing AND the box has a sliding lid, BRILLIANT. I actually bought it too and looove it, as for the Melissa & Doug one, I have to find another box to put all the pieces together... not very smart.With kids, you want to keep things organized and mess-free as much as posible, so GO with the Target brand, it is just as good quality, better design and cheaper!!!"
0," WILL NOT PLAY: I was not warned by Amazon beforehand that this item cannot be played on a regular CD or DVD player so I am warning you, do not buy this item."
1, Great Stainless Steel Electric Kettle: I only have the kettle about six weeks and am very happy with it.Pros: Great kettle and it boils water very fast. Looks beautiful.Cons: It gives off a lot of steam before it turns itself off. When I am filling it with water; I cannot see how much I am putting in. It is really hard to see the water level.
1," Works perfectly, hasn't scratched my cookware: I've now had my Chef'n Kitchzen slotted spatula for a couple of years. It is made of a durable, heat resistant plastic material that is comfortable and easy to grip. It seems impervious to damage from the heat of my frying pan, skillet, or dishwasher, and the turner edge has not worn or yellowed like the cheaper white plastic spatulas I've owned previously. Last but not least, it has not scratched any of my $600 Anolon coated cookware."
0," What's Wrong With You Readers?: I am constantly surprised at the amount of readers who take D'Souza's ignorant rightist rantings as facts. The man is simply the most successful con artist I've read--passing himself off as a scholar and sociologist for years while simply lacking in key areas: respect for cultural space, logical arguments, and quite simply knowledge of his subject matter.D'Souza is by far the most disrespectful and ignorant of lime-light scholars today. Readers, don't bother reading this or any of D'Souza's work. His books as well as his breath are but a waste of space."
1," Not as funny as Austin Powers, but worth watching!: This movie is so funny. Jim Carry's perfomance was totally good. I give him 2 thumbs up for doing this movie. Carry will make you laugh if you watch this. Jim Carry plays Miami's top (and only) pet detective Ace Ventura on his biggest case yet. Although Carry's role in this movie appears to be an idiot, he always gets the job done no matter what it takes. The movie also stars FRIENDS' Courteney Cox who plays the detective who hires Ace. The case is mainly about the kidnapping of Miami Dolphin's dolphin, Snowflake. Ace has a little competition in solving this case with the LT of the police, Lois Einhorn, who finds Ventura worthless. Ace uses every piece of little evidence he finds. Whenevery he tries out his theory, he ends up in some zany mess which will make you laugh. I really liked the part when he was in the tank with a shark. Miami Dolphin's QB Dan Marino plays himself who also gets involved with kidnappings. Get this movie, you'll love it!"
0," disturbed = garbage: ok thankfully this nu-metal fad is quickly on it's way out, and disturbed should b the 1st to go. obviously the rest of the world is getting as tired of over-produced unoriginal corporate ""teen angst"" as i am (& have been for a while now)..."
0, NOT VERY GOOD: I have played every zelda game ever but out and this one sucks. I really think sailing all over the place is boredom on a par with watching golf on tv. The overall feel is a very boring cartoon with endless amounts of time wasted getting from one place to another...Play OOT again and enjoy a good Zelda game.
1," The new V series.: I'm loving the new V. Anna is wickedly deceptive while being sexy at the same time. Father Jack reminds everyone of their humanity. Ryan shows what a V with emotions is like. Hobbes brings everyone in focus while adding humor. Erika makes tough choices and tries to protect her son. Lisa is pretty and innocent as she grows more emotional. Erika's son reminds everyone of their youth and choices to be made. The suspense and story lines are keeping up with today's world. Everything seems more believable. I strongly recommend people watch this show. I think it's better than the original, especially the special effects."
1," Deep: This is a really, really deep book. Especially if you are a Christian this is an awesome book. The characters are very well developed and the story of this girl is very stirring. Of course, it is a ""chick"" book, and although I normally don't read those kind of books, every now and then you want to."
1, Nice little cam: Have an outside cam system but wanted something inside that was hidden in case someone ever got in my home. This works. I have it hooked up to a mini DVR that will take a photo or video if there is movement. The Mini Pinhole is a color cam with nightvision in black/white. The camera actually takes some clear photos and videos. It was easy to conceal also.
0," A Big No-No!: I reccomended this movie to help my younger sisters stop fighting. It didn't help because it showed two cousins named Vanessa and Shaina who were fighting in the first episode and the girls thought they were role-models. Vanessa kept saying that Shaina was copying her when she really wasn't. Anyway, the girls tried to divide the room to show each other which side of the room belonged to who. In like just a half hour later, Vanessa packs all her toys and favorite things and moves to the garage. The second episode about Binyah Binyah's parade was not a problem. I don't know what happened then, but I still do not reccomend this video to kids who are three up to the end of kindergarten. We watched this movie up until the ages of nine, eight, and seven years old and then we got rid of it, thank goodness!"
1, Love it every time I watch it: Amazing film -- superb acting. Have seen it several times and it's always good. Diane Lane and RIchard Gere are fantastic.
0," wasted money: cd was terrible, outdated, poorly done, dump this, sorry. This item provided little if any help.I have more than th"
0," What a snooze!: As most loyal fans of Patricia Cornwell, I anxiously await any new stories she publishes. After reading her latest, Isle of Dogs, I can honestly say Cornwell needs to go back to writing the Scarpetta novels. Isle of Dogs was one of those books you can pick up or put down and forget about it. The latter is where I was with it.Isle of Dogs is a continuation of the Judy Hammer series, but I found very little about Hammer in this book. There are several new characters introduced in this title, instead of Hammer being the main character, and that was quite disappointing. Cornwell seemed to focus a little too much on the character of Andy, as well as providing a history lesson about the area, which was incredibly boring. The storyline goes as most of her novels do - people get killed, butchered, and eventually a lone perpetrator gets a conscience and confesses. End of story. That is how boring this book was."
0," Meh... They aren't as loud as everybody says.: ""El Grande"" translates to ""The Largest"". Hopefully Fiamm isn't a woman-owned company, otherwise they've been living their lives full of disappointment.Want to get the attention of other drivers? Don't install the horns. Instead, keep them in your glove box and simply throw them at the car of the driver who pissed you off.Fiamm should have used a room full of bitchy ex wives as their design target."
0," What a waste of money.: It did not work. Before I even put the batteries in it, I could hear a loose piece of plastic rattling around. Sure enough, it would select the satellite properly but not the TV. It was packed properly, so it didn't happen in shipping.Mirriam-Webster puts it like this: an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. That is what happened to me."
0," CNN describes it as ""klunky""; no ecosystem built around it: This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod. Same with cars.Wireless function is severely hampered. You can get a song ""squirted"" to you only if the other person gives you permission. Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.Why bother with the Zune?"
0," SO Unhappy!: I never received this product and I am so upset about it. I ordered it twice and it never arrived. I have ordered beofre through amazon and never a problem, however I will NEVER be using this service again!"
0," Not what I was looking for: It's a fine book, but I was looking for something that would tell me more about my baby's development and how to meet him at his level and less about how great the author is."
0," Not worth the price: I purchased this model in 2009. After three days of use, the non-stick coating peeled off!!Forget this brand and go with Toastess electric kettles. Much better quality there."
0," Truly The Other Side Of Life: This is the worst Moody Blues album ever. Not much good came out of 1986, and the Moody Blues proved it with processed music and slick production. The best songs are the Hayward hits, including ""Your Wildest Dream"" and ""The Other Side Of Life."" The best Lodge song is ""It May Be A Fire."" The best Hayward/Lodge song is ""Running Out Of Love,"" and the other best song would have to be the Edge/Moraz song ""The Spirit."" The rest of the album is largely forgettable, and I would not recommend this recording, even to Moody Blues fans. All the other 1980's albums by the Moody Blues are at least 3-1/2 stars, but this '86 outing ranks the lowest at two stars."
0," Not much here, except encouragement: I can't say I got many ideas from this book, but it did inspire me a bit. So many people tell you ""wedddings are SO expensive"" but this book tells you ""yes, you can do it cheaper."" I didn't actually use any of the ideas, most were pretty unoriginal. But it did a good job of keeping my spirits up, at those moments when I was feeling poor and pathetic while planning my wedding."
0," ingersoll 4151 ultra duty 6 inch sander: junk,junk because it is made so cheap, i should of known better because it is made in china, Don't drop it because the plastic muffler breaks easy"
1," gift: cheap fabric, but looks great on my sons window. I was happy with how great it looks with my sons bedding. overall, I would buy it again. I have no complaints with the shipping or the purchasing of this product."
0," pagan catholic propaganda movie: This DVD is blasphemous and includes much paganism from the start. It is an obvious attempt to proclaim that peter was the first pope.I cannot believe how many people believe this movie followed the bible. The first 1/2 hour loosely followed the bible but included much paganism. The rest of the movie was unbiblical and made peter out to be holier than anyone else and is an attempt to get people to believe he was the first pope. The entire movie was totally pagan / catholic. This movie is blasphemous and should not be watched by anyone. It is sad how many people think it was a good movie and claim it follows the bible.If you are a TRUE Christian, this movie is very pagan and blasphemous. For those who are pagans/ catholics, you will probably like the movie as it feeds your pagan beliefs.If there was an option for no stars, I would have given this movie no stars."
1, A great must have pirate collection: The collection of pirate movies is a must have giving you some of the greatest with terrific stories and acting.
1," Pretty Good but Freeman Patterson has another better one: This is a good book on composition and related matters but Freeman Patterson has a much better one in ""Photographing the World Around You: A Visual Design Workshop"". Buy that one instead of this. This book would rate about a B, B+ or at best an A- whereas the other would be solidly in the ""A"" category. Freeman's text is clear and easy to understand and his photo's are fine but the other book is better in all ways IMHO."
1," Uppers, downers, all arounders: The book contains very detailed interesting information and even though I had to purchase this book for a class, this might be the only textbook I own that I actually enjoy reading"
1," kung-fu or wu-shu: One of the best movie on this category. Along with ""Enter of the Dragon"" a must for your collection!"
1," Wonderful Read: I first discovered LET'S GO FOR BROKE in the San Francisco Public Library over 25 years ago -- and enjoyed it tremendously.The 3 main characters - Miss Tinkham, Mrs. Rassmussen and Mrs. Feeley are fiercely independent ladies who may be a little short on pocket change -- but not on kindness and determination to see their projects through.This delightful book brims with ""heart"" and Ms. Lasswell's descriptions of the ladies as they go forth to conquer their problems are funny, touching and sometimes hilarious.If you want to read a great book that will leave you with a warm feeling, LETS GO FOR BROKE sure fills the bill!"
1, Great for Podcasting!: I'm in the middle of starting up a new podcast and after reading countless reviews of mics I decided to go with this one. It's a wonderful mic and records perfectly. I would suggest this mic to anyone seriously considering starting a podcast and needing a great mic but have a tight budget!
0," Not a review of the item: I never received this camera. I tracked shipment online, noted it was delivered. I went to the post office, they said it was scanned when delivered. Nobody can tell me where the camera is and what happened to it. Although I believe it is not Amazon's fault,the experience will hold me back from purchasing online and having it delivered by mail. Just FYI.Andy Tan"
1, Willing - to read again and again: All three books in this series were excellent. It was hard to put them down and yet you hated to get to the end of the book. Recommend these three for any romance fan.
1," A charming romance!: I happened upon this movie on Masterpiece Theater on PBS and what a sweet and charming piece! I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time through but thankfully had taped it, so that I could watch it again and catch some of the lines previously missed due to the heavy English accents. A beautiful story of true love winning out. Highly recommend!"
1," Good Filter: I cut open filters that fit the same car from Fram (Tough Guard)' Mobil 1, and this Pure 1 filter. You cannot tell what size particles are captured by the media this way (Mobil 1 and Pure 1 claim synthetic media), but you can count pleets. The Pure 1 had nearly twice as many, and the bypass and general construction seems to be better also. And the Pure 1 costs about half of what the Mobil 1 filter costs."
0," God save us from Janet and Mark: I'm giving this two stars only because these books really can teach children to read, which supposedly was their main purpose. I learned to read on them and hated Janet and Mark, particularly Janet. (My name is Janet, which didn't help.) If you need more reasons, check out this very telling review dated September 3, 1970 -- the day before my 6th birthday, which would be exactly the time I was being ""indoctrinated"" with these two kids and their Stepford wife of a mother. [...]"
1," A few things you should know about 'First Utterance': Not many albums feel genuinely dangerous. This one does.The band, in their photos, look like psychotics, hippies gone wrong. While some metal bands have cited Comus as an influence, in fact 'First Utterance' leaves a lot of metal for dead in the 'heaviness' stakes - although few metalheads would admit that due to the non-electric instrumentation. The album can't really be compared to anything else. It isn't folk. It isn't rock. It is unique. It makes you want to start jumping round the room and smashing things. It is Dionysian, violent, beautiful, timeless...Forty years after its release, 'First Utterance' makes most of today's music seem like mechanised sludge by comparison."
1," Absolutely Flawless Entertainment!: I saw the original presentation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo about 2-1/2 years ago and loved it. However, this extended edition of the trilogy exceeded my wildest expectations!! Seeing the new American version of the film rekindled my interest in the story and prompted me to purchase the trilogy edition. At first I was a bit worried that the dubbing would be what I call ""hokey,"" but let me tell you...it's fantastic. Don't get me wrong...I enjoy subtitles when it comes to foreign films. However, this time, I wanted to concentrate on the action and nuances first. I will view all three movies again using the original soundtrack with subtitles. If you are looking for top-notch entertainment in films, this dvd set is for you. I highly recommend this set for those seeking a unique and unforgettable gift. It's the ultimate gift of perfection!"
1, This book is excellent and insightful to any Catholic.: This book is excellent and insightful to anyone wanting to gain depth and understanding of the Catholic faith. It deepened my knowledge and renewed my love for our wonderful Catholic Church.
0," Informative, But Terribly Dry: The translation is incredibly hard to read, with no pattern to the text and sadly thread-bare quality to the language itself. This reads like an astute yet uninspired translation by an academic writer. The tranliterations are a bit out-of-date (Athena as Athana, for example).Admittedly, Bowra suggest that Pindar himself is hard to read. There is evidence for this in the subject matter of the poems: Pindar covers enormous depth in small space.There are notes at the end of every poem, which, for me, are preferable to endnotes. One learns more than expect about the life of a lyric poet: Pindar's movements from city to city and his expectation of payment for poetry.I would not recommend this translation to a friend."
0," Makes my dog fart like a skunk: My dog loves to chew on these, but dang, they give her the worst gas I've ever smelled in my life, and it goes on for hours. They probably don't cause the same reaction in all dogs, but I won't buy them anymore."
0," boring: The author seems to be trying very hard to fill up the book on a subject whose life comes across as ""uninteresting"". For example, the description of Marie Antoinette's nose and looks fill up pages. Bits and pieces about some individuals are spread among several chapters, making it difficult to get a full insight of these characters. In other words, the book is poorly laid out, and the stories are fragmented ... perhaps it is because there isn't much to say about Marie Antoinette in the first place."
1, family oriented: This winnie the Pooh film was very clean and perfect for our big family! We have small children and are very careful with what they watch but with this movie we didnt have to worry a bit!
1," Would you like to President of the USA? Then, play the game!: If I could give this great game 50 stars, I would!! It is far the best boardgame, I have ever played. If you want to spend the evening playing with your kids, aunts, uncles, grandma's and grandpa's, this is the perfect game. If you earn enough popularity points and money, you will be the winner and probably have been the President of the USA? Pretty good bragging rights, don't you think???"
0," Great service, nasty buzz and humm: I love the Vonage service compared with Verizon's old-world service, but my first PAP2 had a relatively loud background humm. I returned the unit to Amazon (VERY EASY!!), but the second unit had the same humming, so I am putting up with it now and will call Vonage sometime again. I've read about this problem from others, too.[EDIT 3/1/06] It's a little late now(!), but if you plug in a connector into Line 2 and short the wires together, the unit works great with no buzz!"
0," Junk - Will Not Waste Any More Money On This Product: No more of these for me. They used to last about two months, but now two weeks.I have seen that PUR has weaseled their words and now say two weeks to a max of two months.Never had any issues with this product, but something internally in the filter is not the same as the older ones."
1," Tools of the trade: This is a great find! A warning light came on in my car and instead of taking my car to the dealer so they could tell me I needed tons of stuff that would cost me loads of money I bought this little gadget. Hook up is a breeze and within a few minutes (start to finish) I had a code that allowed me to know what was wrong. Turns out it's no big deal, but an item the dealer would charge me $500+ for. A nice investment for $50, I am very happy. So much for being just a girl!"
0," what a piece of junk!: this thing frustrated me, my daughter and everyone else that tried to help her program it! it would not recognize any words that any of us spoke, we couldn't get it to accept a password code. buyer beware, stick with the old school lock and key journals."
1," Big and awsome.: I love this, but its big...real big. I love it, my son loves it and it keeps him and his stuff contained. I have told many people about this item. i would say it should be left up and not taken up and down all the time. I could see how other reviews had brake issues with the play yard, however I have not had any and i think its because I leave it up in one area."
1," The first toy my daughter smiled at, but the mirror might as well be tinfoil: My daughter has loved this toy since she was a month old. Once she developed the social smile, I would catch her smiling in response to the firefly's smiley face.Now she is almost five months old and she likes to grab and chew on various parts of the toy, but does not find the teether particularly interesting.I did give Freddy the firefly a bath in the washing machine in a mesh beg and cold water without detergent, as it makes no sense to give to your child a cloth toy that you know she will chew on without washing it first. The crinkly stuff still works, even three washes later.I am not fond of the mirror. The only thing it has in common with a mirror is the name, otherwise it's just a shiney surface, which, I guess, is ok, since it's a safety mirror on a toy."
1," Amazing watch: I used to wear oversized chronograph watches, but i'm faszinated by this extremly thin watch with it's deep blue coloured dial. Very elegant to wear in the office and with casual jeans too.Very fast and secure delivery to europe.This beauty can only be rated 5*****"
0," Not sure why others think this is so accurate: Had this unit for about a month and was going to return, but with cost of postage back to non-Amazon seller, just wasn't worth the trouble and cost. To me, this unit doesnt seem to work well. I've been out with a steady wind and the unit seems to indicate little to no wind. I got to help calibrate my Davis weatherstation and it rarely seems to correlate. The buttons are hard to push and controls are a bit unintuitive. I would not recommend."
0," Terrible, horrid, total waste of money.: Don't buy this book. Your money well be better spent elsewhere."
0, Don't Bother with this Seller: This was not the item I ordered. Sent 2 emails requesting help. NO response. Went to local electronics store and purchased right item. They never had the courtesy to respond.
1," Jeez, never heard of CS?: Okay sure you have very limited gameplay in the first person mode but hey, CS is a online game not single player. CS is probably the most real game anyone could get. First of all if you die, you DIE. This is real life people. If your killed your killed."
0, Does not show you how: This book just say that you should settle your disputes with methods such as mediation and negitiation but teach not tell you how you can do it.A disappointment.
0," Horrific Language.: I know that this was very dark humor, which I could live with. However, the word F- - - ! used in all of its tenses was disgusting and I'm not a prude!"
0," WARN no better than a cheap imitation: I live in the southern united states and purchased the WARN wench cover, because WARN is suppose to be ""the best."" I applied the ""aerospace"" protectant as directed, but within 60 days of installing on my wench....the black color had completely faded. I have spoken to other who purchased the same product and they took additional sun precautions and ended up with the same results. The cover fits great and protects from the rain ...but if you live in a sunny location and don't want a two tone wench cover, I would not purchase again."

0," 1 of Those Fragrances That Just Don't Smell Good on my skin....: Most fragrances just don't smell nice on my skin, & this is 1 of them...."
1," Wow!: Haven't finished the whole thing quite yet, but I'm very impressed by the book! It takes a very logical approach through theology and attends to many vital fundamental issues. If I could make one criticism, it's that Sheed seems to assume a certain amount of theological background at some times, but then later proceeds to discuss (in detail) things that such a background would presumably already contain. That's nit-picking to the max, though.Once again: great read, great theology, great stuff overall. While I'm reading it, I feel like every qualm I have is addressed and resolved almost immediately.Would recommend to anyone!"
0, Garbage: I read this book on june 10th and was shocked at how self-absorbed this woman has become. Everything that happened in the Clinton years she sees as her own design or influence. I didnt expect the book to reveal this scary truth.this is real creepy stuff...
0, Disappointed in Krups 10 cup Aroma Control: After having spent a lot of money on this coffeemaker I am thoroughly unhappy with it. The swing out basket is difficult to pull out and is constructed of very [inexpensive] plastic. I am afraid if I tug at it too hard it will break. The lid on the carafe doesn't twist on easily. Sometimes I have to do it several times before it's on securely and evenly. Pouring from the carafe is messy at times since there is no lip for this function. I also have to run hot water into the carafe for a while before brewing so that the coffee will be hotter. My old Mr. Coffee for a lot less money made better coffee.
0," Delusions of a would-be feminist: once again, mernissi has used the literary forum to vent her personal venom against her faith. As a reader searching for actual scholarly or literary value, I find her books an absolute abomination. A ""bayt arabi"" (arab-style house with a courtyard in the middle) is not a haram, nor is the extended family setting Mernissi describes. At least not in most households. But an account of life in a ""haram"" is sure to sell. I've travelled widely throughout the middle east and have spoken to countless women, in seclusion and privacy, learning their language in order to gain their trust, and rarely have I encountered the kind of frustration Mernissi depicts in this, or any of her books."
1," Profoundly absorbing writing by a medical doctor: I have read initially The story of San Michelle while I was a medical student in Trivandrum Medical College (India) way back in early 1960's. I must have reread the book at least 5 or 6 times since then. Everytime I read the book, I really wished to visit the island described by Dr Axel Munthe and his San Michele. I still marvel at the honest narration and great readability of the book. I would certainly recommend this book to every medical student anywhere in the World."
0," Much much darker than described: The marker must have been in inventory for a long time because it was a bit dried out and didn't work properly. When it did work, it was inconsistent, and even worse, it was NOT a light wood color at all. It was more of a dark walnut color. So disappointed. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it arrived on time."
0," Terrible: Though I have loved the other books in the Dark Series, this one is terrible. Destiny is very whiny and seems to enjoy her victim status. Nicholae is a good character but the relationship with Destiny has no sizzle. It was mostly blood and gore with very little romance. Even though I have been a strong Feehan fan, I can NOT recommend this book."
0," Not as good as the Movie: I guess I should have read the book and then seen the movie instead of the other way around. The movie is much better than the book. This book spends way too much time on Julie and very little time on Julia Child. Thus, the book was quite disappointing. See the movie, don't waste money on this book, get it at the library. Also, the foul language in the book was soooooo unnecessary and offensive. This gal is no lady. The movie can never be over-rated, but the book is grossly over-rated."
0, Not worth the money: I read a lot of great reviews on this product so I thought I would give it a try. Not that impressed with the sound quality. Starts off great but then it gets raspy and thin. The only other rosin I have experience with is the light rosin by Sherman which I will be going back to.
1, Like others have said these are a little thin.: The 2 separate strips of glue to seal it work good. Not like super sticky but as long as the item isn't hefty no need to tape as insurance.
0," Very unhappy 0 for 2 and no customer service on the weekend: We ordered the motorola hs810 headset and the charger was defective. We actually ordered two products from Tiger Direct and both products were defective. We now need to wait for Tiger to contact us, and wait for them to fix the problem with both products. Oh yes, what was wrong with the other headset we ordered? It was used... yes, somebody elses ear was wearing it and it wasn't a clean ear either... needless to say I can not recommend this company."
0," New remote that doesn't work: I bought this remote from Amazon and went through the easy programing. If you are concerned about setting up a remote, don't be, it was easier than anything I have seen. Installed the software via the supplied disk and let it do the automatic upgrade from Logitech website. I put in all my model #'s and only one of the ""Activity"" buttons worked.

0," Schizo Movie: This is a movie that couldn't decide what it wanted to be.At the beginning, the aliens vaporize all the humans they can, so it looks like they want the earth for it's natural resources. But they first came here millions of years ago before humans were here, so why didn't they just take it then. Huh??At the end, the aliens have come here to eat us as food. If that was the case, why did they vaporize their groceries at the beginning of the movie. Huh???Mostly, it is a movie filled with gore for no good purpose in the plot. Yuck!"

0," Save your time and money and pass this one by!: After researching this product and reading many reviews (admittedly more bad than good), I decided to purchase this product. In fact, I purchased through Amazon due to the fact there would be no hassle if the product failed to live up to its claims. The heater worked fine...for about 7 hours or so and then refused to operate. Customer service was no help. The room was 64 degrees and it was set to high and still would not operate. I'd say skip this lemon. However, if you decide to roll the dice, purchase through a dealer such as Amazon who will not hassle you if you should need to (and probably will need to), return it. And don't forget to open the box carefully so you have something in which to ship it back! Good luck!"
1," Another phat release from Dan: DJ Dan has always been one of my favorite DJ's, and this is exactly why. I wasn't even aware that DJ Dan had come out with a new mix CD until I stumbled upon it at Amazon.com. He definately does not disappoint. This CD is full of the funky, bangin' house that Dan has been spinning the last couple years. This CD has rekindled my decreasing faith in house music. By the way, does anyone find it strange that DJ Dan has a record called ""Get Next To The Opposite Sex?"""
0," Like a Plot from a Soap Opera: This movie is like a plot from a daytime soap opera that would be played out over a year and a half, here pieced together to form a feature-length film. Like most soap opera plots, it's corny and ridiculous and has many holes, flaws, impossibilities, etc. The acting is also horrendous as is the script, loaded with corny and laughably bad dialogue horribly delivered by the actors. It does have potential to be a so bad it's good piece of entertainment, if you're in the mood for that. Then again, it really is so bad that you may not even find it that good."
1," RCA Re-issue Coming June 2, 2003 -- With Bonus Tracks!: Wow! Wow! Wow, fellas! What a time this is for 82-year-old Carol Channing! She just got married, the DVD of ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" will be released on June 2 and now comes word that RCA will reissue the dazzling original Broadway cast recording of ""Hello,Dolly!"" (also on June 2) with cleaned up sound and bonus tracks by Channing's fellow Dollys: Ethel Merman, Mary Martin and Pearl Bailey. I wonder if they'll fix Channing's verbal error in ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" which has marred the recording for 39 years. No complaints! This 1964 recording is still the very best momento of one of the great theatrical experiences of a lifetime. Before you purchase the CD, make sure it's the new reissue."
0," Lacks Depth; Not the Original Recordings: If you prefer hired studio artists taking the soul out of the original, heartfelt performances of the artists who originally wrote these songs, then this is for you. If you would rather experience the depth and meaning meant to be heard in this great songs, then look elsewhere. Maybe start by googling ""Alan Lomax."""
0," Should not be in the ""Parenting"" section of bookstores...: Rather, it should be in the humor section, if anywhere. Half of the ""advice"" given is just plain bad - is it meant to be sarcastic? It sure seems to be. Yes, you need a sense of humor as a mother, but to have a book that claims to be a ""guide"" or give advice and have it in the Parenting sections of bookstores... that's not right. The breastfeeding advice is poor, and it contains offensive misconceptions such as, ""If you are LUCKY enough to stay home...""I think this book exists in order to give ""modern"" moms something to read so they can claim they've read a book on parenting."
1," An excellent compilation of Tommy's best from 1979-85.: Virtually every song on this compilation was a hit. The late Frankie Ruiz is the most-often heard singer here but Paquito Guzman and Simon Perez (both of whom left the band circa 1981) are also featured as lead singers. I failed to give this CD a 5-star rating because it has no liner notes or discographical information whatsoever, though."
1," A History Lesson In Lycanthropy: Not the volumes of Bray Road sightings I expected, but a good study on were-creatures and shape-shifters.

0," Buying different vacuum after only 1.5 years: I usually own vacuums for about 15 years on average. This one I'm getting rid of after 1.5 years. I hate it. The brushes continue to spin when using the hand tools and it put a hole in my rug. The cord doesn't stay locked in the channel up the back of the vacuum, so it effectively attaches at the base of the vacuum and I continually run over the cord. The hose is short. I spent the money for the separate extra long hose, but the vacuum tips over whenever I use it because it is too heavy for the vacuum. This vacuum is cheap and it has alot of suction power, but I can't say much else positive about it."
0," God, is this a Bad Movie: Awful, awful, awful. Awful script bleats on for four hours, big ol' fake beards (Jeb Stuart's beard is so bad that you'll want to rewind to take another look). Lots and lots of praying, so we know Stonewall was a good god-fearin' fella. Lots of really bad ""southern"" accents. This is just a BAD movie. Bad like a puppy that needs a whack with a newspaper. I'm wracking my brain to think of something positive to say about it... well, at least I didn't die while it was on."
1, LOVE IT!: Another must read for pregnant women to know all their options about birth. Gives you a beautiful outlook on the birthing experience.
0," Boelcke deserved much better: The backbone of the book are the letters from Boelcke to his family. However, Cap. Boelcke was writing to his parents, not to general public interested in WWI aviation. So, the writer should be expected to provide a reasonable amount of contextualization. But Mr. Werner had no interest in performing any serious research. His preference was for shameless propaganda. For instance, he will teach you that Oswald Boelcke had the luck of being born in a true German family. The flattery is so exaggerated that portraits that outstanding man in a kind of Mickey Mouse perfection, removing from him any trace of humanity. Four Stars to the letters from Oswald Boelcke, zero to the Johannes Werner's text, making the 2 stars average this book deserves."
1," Sophisticated rock-pop production turn for Bay Area quartet: Recording in their brand new self-built studio, this Bay Area quartet (reduced to a trio with Melody Baldwin's post-recording departure) has shifted from their country-roots base to a more produced pop sound. Their latest collection is substantially lusher than earlier releases, crossing guitar-rock with sunshine harmony vocals and the studio craft of classic '60s West Coast pop. Engineered by the band's drummer, Peter Craft, the sound is both spacious and intimate; the vocals settle comfortably into instrumental passages that fill out songs of disintegrating relationships, spiritual quandaries, and meditative circumstance. The lack of a clock ticking away precious studio time clearly freed the band to explore creative new directions in writing, playing and producing, resulting in a sophisticated leap forward.

1," A must book for making a meaningful life: This book is very insightful in helping one find meaning in one's life as formulated in the methods of logotherapy which was developed by a Viktor Frankl, a survivor of one of the worst possible existences in the modern era, the Nazi concentration camps. The first part of the book Viktor recalls his experiences at the camps and all that he learned and gained from them to develop his concepts. The remaining part analyses in more detail logotherapy. This book is a must for all of who find emptiness in our lives or are hurt by anxiety or other concerns. The book is easy to read."

The way up it was okay.. but on the way home.. the rack broke. Mind you.. you might be thinking it was our fault.. buuut.. the way the boards went my board should've been one of the first boards to go because it was near the clamp.. but when heard this huge noise on our roof.. we looked up and my board was the last one on top and then it flew onto the freeway. It really was surreal! Thank God no one got hurt! But be wary of this product!! I had my board for 6 years.. my first board ever and I'm really upset it's gone. I wasn't planning on buying anymore snow equipment because I was happy with what I had. So if you really want this product.. take your chances with it.. I wouldn't. If i get a new board, it's staying in the car."
1," The New Yorker Distaff Side: Helen Hokinson was a cartoonist for the NEW YORKER in its glory years, and all or almost all these cartoons were originally published there. (Many were reprinted in the HOKINSON FESTIVAL, so if you own that there won't be a lot of surprises.)New to Hokinson? Like Arno and Steig, she specialized on a particular type of New Yorker--women of the upper middle class in the years before they were expected to have careers. If you remember Elwood Dowd's sister from HARVEY, you've got the Hokinson type--garden clubs, dog shows, amateur theatricals and ladies' auxilliaries. Seldom profound, but very funny. Worth the investment."

0," Crude and short on true humor: I rented this movie because I thought the trailer was funny. Turns out, the humor was very crude and in my opinion, even over the line. I ended up turning it off half way through the film, and I honestly can't remember the last time I did that. I have never written a movie review, but found this film to be so disappointing in its lack of substance that I feel compelled to tell others."
1," Read, imagine, live: A classic of sociological thought, and one of the best (if not the best) accounts on the purpose and tasks of sociological mindset. Sociological imagination (or perspective, if you will) as intersection of biography and history - pure and simple, yet succinctly incisive and elegantly descriptive. Still a very relevant, influential and timely text for each and all."
1," Good Season - bad special features: Season 4 of Lois and Clark is provably one of the best seasons of the series. It starts off with the cliff-hanger from last season and ends it well. Along the way, you meet Mr. MXYZTLIK, watch Lois fight for her life - in court-, and see the happy couple struggle with having children. (Not in that order). It is a great way to end the series.There two complaints though: (1) Story: the very ending of Lois and Clark is far too quickly and neatly resolved to feel satisfying. It would have been nice to see them find another way to end the last few minutes. (2) Special Features: There aren't really any. The single special feature - ""Kryptonian Kronology"" - is very dull and is not up to modern standards of DVD special features.This is worth a purchase, only get it used. It's not worth the 45 dollar price tag."
1," A Fan of Catherine Cookson since the 1960's.: I read this book when it first came out, and decided to read it again. It is still my favorite book by Cookson. I've always saidthe charaters in her books are never happy until they are a hundred and one, but Cookson makes you feel the sadness and the happiness, and her books always make me glad that I did not live at that time, with all the poverty, when it was only the rich and the poor."

1," A fine photographic homage to Northwest railroads!: ""Rolling Dreams: Portraits of the Northwest's Railroad Heritage"" is a laudable homage to the Pacific Northwest's rail transportation network.D.C. Jesse Burkhardt's 78 color images (and 12 b&w ones) are sharp, varied, and celebratory.His grand and dynamic pictures (e.g., ""Sherars Crossing,"" where a southbound container train crosses a trestle over Oregon's Deschutes River) are nicely matched by quiet--and even somber--photos (e.g., ""Forgotten Rails,"" where wildflowers and fog hover above the abandoned Astoria line of the Burlington Northern).A few of Burkhart's pictures--such as the hushed Oregon snow scene of a stretch of the Southern Pacific railway--would have been far more effective had they been larger.And a couple of photos are a shade too dark.But Burkehardt is a talented photographer and writer, and he has produced a fine work."

I REMEMBER WHEN TOMMY WAS A ROOKIE WITH INDIANS AND WHAT A MAJOR MISTAKE THE INDIANS MADE IN TRADING HIM. ALSO WOTH MENTIONING IS HIS COME BACK FROM HIS (BIONIC) LIGAMENT REPLACEMENT AND THE TRAGIC FALL OF HIS INFANT SON AND THE VIGIL AND FAITH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD DURING THESE TRYING TIMES.

1," One for the heart: For all residents of Southern California past, present, or potential, there can be no better book about this unmatchable part of the world. Past residents (like myself) will sigh with fond remembrance, current residents will be amused, and potential future residents will be astonished. All will be entertained. The land, the geography, the history, and the weather. They're all discussed. The social outcasts, the wierd misfits, the kooks, the characters, and their schemes and dreams. It's all here, along with so very much more. Written by a longtime resident in a very entertaining style that combines dinner conversation with classroom lecture, this book will be a joy to anyone who has a love for the irreplacable experience of Living In Southern California. You will truly FEEL as though you are there. This book is one for the heart as well as the mind. Oh Los Angeles, how I miss you. Carey McWilliams, thanks for taking me back."
1," Portrait Of A Man: Fresh out of jail, the infamous Tupac Shakur recorded his latest and first double album ""All Eyes On Me"". Filled with anger, pain, sadness and relief, this two disc cd is pure gold to its listener. 2pac was not just another gangster rapper, his music still lives on years after his passing for a reason. Shakur was the 90's modern philospher/revolutionist. Nobody spoke pain and struggle better then this man, and it breathes through his music. Whether you live in the suburbs or on the streets there's at least one song that will speak to you. But Tupac was also a hypocritical and confused man and it reflects in his variety of topics. I wont speak on the track listing because almost every song on this album is solid. Don't take my word for it however, buy any Tupac release or read ""The rose that grew from concrete"" and enter the mind of a soldier. RIP TUPAC SHAKUR"
1," Williams gives an oscar worthy performance: ""One Hour Photo"" is a very strange kind of film. While casting this film, director Mark Romanek wanted to give the role to Jack Nicholson but he turned it down. With all respect to Jack Nicholson, this was the best news the project could have heard. I say this because Robin Williams is the only actor that could really do a great job playing the character of Sy Parish.""One Hour Photo"" is about photo technician Sy Parish (Williams). Sy is very passionate at his job. He puts his full effort into every photo he develops. He has developed photos for the Yorkin family ever since there son was born. He becomes obsessed with their family and imagines himself as ""Uncle Sy"". Once Sy finds out that Mr. Yorkin is into some shady things, he goes to great lengths to make things right.Robin Williams did a wonderful job in this film!!If you are a fan of thriller/suspense films you should enjoy ""One Hour Photo""."
0," Blade Runner Final Cut: I have not seen this movie in a while but I am not very happy with The final cut. When I originally saw the movie theatrical version I loved the special effects and the characters, I can't explain it but the characters in this movie, were not very dimensional. I believe the movie is missing some special effects the original one had.Don't waste your time on this version get the theatrical."
0," Didn't fit properly: I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy. However, I ended up needing to return it. It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps, except the one strap that goes under your belly. This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable. I definitely couldn't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat, but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product. Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works. My only suggestion would be, if you are a slightly bigger girl, try ordering one size larger than you think. I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size. Anyhow, it was worth a try. Now if I can just find something else. This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman."
0," Manufacturer confirmed information: After reading previous reviews on how the Arctic Twister is difficult to say the least to operate, I contacted the manufacturer directly.

0," NOT for oily skin: I really wanted to like this but was disappointed. I gave it a couple of weeks to see if my skin would adjust, but today is probably the last day I'll use it. My skin is naturally slightly oily, but this made it SUPER greasy. It goes on nice and light, so that was surprising.Today as soon as I left work all I could think about was rushing home to wash my face! What's worse, I have broken out badly - big pimples that also itch, so not sure if it's a breakout or an allergic reaction - either way, no thanks. I might continue to use it under my eyes where my skin is drier just to see if it helps with the fine lines there (only because there are so many positive reviews), but definitely won't be using again on my face/neck/decolletage."
1," Andre Previn plays Harold Arlen: This is a 1994 digital remastering of an LP Andre Previn made in 1960. As a result, LPs couldn't run to more than an hour's playing time so we have an all-too-brief concert of Previn playing ten mostly well-known tunes by Harold Arlen. I knew all of the tunes except one called `Cocoanut Sweet'. A lot of favourites that have become standards are here: `That old black magic', played up-tempo and somewhat demonically; `Come rain or come shine' - a beautiful tender rendition; `Stormy weather', `Over the rainbow' . . . An entertaining 45 minutes of Previn in jazz mode though I found the Telarc Jazz releases of the Trio more satisfying - longer and, with guitar and bass, obviously a more varied sound. The CD Uptown in particular features Arlen compositions with some Ellington.After Hours With Andre PrevinOld FriendsUptown / Songs of Harold Arlen & Duke Ellington"

1," Chicago's early Italians: ""ITALIANS IN CHICAGO"" is part of the book series IMAGES OF AMERICA. The book is a compilation of old photographs that capture the Italian migration of the early 1900's and the life styles of the newly settled immigrants in Chicago. The importance of family, neighborhood and church in establishing a new found Italian-American community is captured pictorially throughout the book. Photographs from the various conclaves of Italians on the north, west and south sides are presented. Although the conclaves are dispersed throughout the city a common cultural uniformity can be seen to develop. The book is a valuable supplement to any serious research on the history of Chicago."

Maybe she should just stick to recording for her family on her karaoke machine. Don't buy it if you're looking for serious popular music!"

(4) the wood handles aren't even finished, but just rough finished.Its sad that Amazon[.com] will take a good name like Sabatier and sell this poor quality product through the internet. I will definitely think twice about ever ordering from Amazon[.com] again."
1," The Losers: I have to admit that this movie was entertaining. The movie is based on a comic book, and the story seems to prepare us for the upcoming ""The A-Team"" adaptation. The movie has it's action packed moments and plenty of laugh-out loud moments also. Of all the leads in this movie, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the movie. In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day. ""The Losers"" delivers about what you'd expect and has some tricks up its sleeve which makes it worth checking out."
0," jWIN JA-C52AC Adapter: I have tried two different samples of this AC adapter which has an attractive price particularly with the settable outputs. Both samples failed to work as advertised. I tried using them with a Chamberlain intercom system that can be either battery operated or with an AC adapter with 12V input. These chargers made the intercom malfunction totally. Fortunately, when I disconnected the AC adapter, the intercom works fine on batteries and I will continue to use only batteries on the intercom. I did put a voltmeter on the output of each of these units and it came as no surprise to find that the output was not as rated but much higher. When set at 12V it was giving 22.8 V at the plug. When set at 6V the output was 11. Both samples behaved similarly and would not work with the intercom. This is junk and I will try to get Amazon to give me a refund on both units."
1," Ye Shall Know the Truth: I have had the pleasure of not only reading most of Bishop Spong's books, but meeting him and his wife here in Dallas. The book is not for fundamentalist, because the research is there to support the findings of Bishop Spong. It is not dependent on Bible proof texting that most fundamentalist are fond of to prove their questionable arguements which not only limits them, but the Bible also. In an age where Christianity is linked with hate, and radical racism Spong shows us that the stone(s) rejected by the builder's have become the cornerstone(s) of faith and reason. Fundamentalist, and Conservative Christians will not like the book as it exposes their flawed belief system. Thank you Bishop Spong for making us free. Truly a pearl not to be cast before swine."
0, Awful: This is horrible. You have to load a CD to recognize a memory card! Come on. Be more realistic get the blue-red memory card pack like Im doing. It takes about 10 seconds to load. You then have to enter the CD. I bought this for fifty bucks with a weird PS2 controller and a vertical stand. My PS2 even says I need a format CD.I had to get this because I could not find a regular emory card. Do not get this game unless you want to enter a CD and then your game. This is memory card is [not good]!!
1, One for the Money: Great fun when is the next one coming out? Went to fast had to watch again. Great afternoon watch.You nailed the players on the head with the actor now when you read the books you have faces to go with the book. Alot of action and laughter.Thanks for a movie you can watch with the children.
0," Another VS movie.....: Im a REALLLLLLL big fan of the Puppet Master Legacy so far until this, this had some BEAUTIFUL women and the puppets thats about it lol.The acting was terrible and most of the story is predictable. The main boy from The Goonies plays the scientist did a suprisingly annoying job and its safe to see why we aint seen him in many movies since The Goonies....this movie could of been a real good movie or atleast good enough for some people to recomise it as a cult movie, but instead i can see this being forgotten, added to the most terrible movies ever list or sold at a Gas station for $3.95"
1," Good album and good service from provider: The album was in good shape (except for a small crack on the jewel case-to be expected after so many years). It arrived very quickly, too."
1, Good for chewers: This is a great toy for dogs that chew up everything else. I have a little Cheagle (Chihuahua and Beagle mix) and she literally eats all her other toys. This is one of the only toys that she's yet to destroy and she loves it! She carries it around everywhere with her. I got the T-Rex and it's the cutest thing :)
0," Heart So Depressing: Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. I reached page 204 and can move no further, for if I come across one more simile, I might blow my freakin' brain out of my cabeza, or jump off of a really high object. Alas, the one positive note is that this book inspired me to fall into the work of an artist whom I love: Georges Bataille. Let me say this too: I don't read much contemporary literature; I was told that this was a great work of contemporary literature; I'll stick to a nostalgia for the works that were written when writers could actually write--thank you very much. I was truly floored by the emptiness of this piece; funny how a book can waste one's time."
0," Nasdaq 20,000?: Page 73 of this book reads ""Our best projection for the Nasdaq is about 13,000 around the end of this decade (2010), but it is possible we could see as high as 20,000."" Let's see, the Nasdaq made its way up to 2861 by Oct. 31, 2007 and now sits at 1316 as of Nov. 21, 2008. Now today, I see this guy on TV saying he predicted the current market meltdown and has written a new book due out in Jan. 2009 entitled ""The Great Depression Ahead"". What a joke."
0," hollow man 2 is indeed that-HOLLOW: there are many reasons to rip apart this movie, there are enough holes that even NEW YORK rats could go through. however, what this movie lacks, it makes up for with a nice presentation, bonus features and really good special effects. the story is slim-unstable serum. there is govermental paranoia, rediculous chases, cheese nudity, a slight look of HALLOWEEN(from the persons POV)--sort of DARKMAN look and feel to the actors in their roles, several nice killings and the typical no brainer ending(SEQUEL) hmmn?, the movie company was lucky it was filming on a dark dreary rainy days!!-lol. movie is not bad. its better than most if you want to be entertained. just try not to get too involved. RENT IT."
0," printing errors: I ordered three copies of 'Fondues and Hot Pots' for Christmas gifts. One of the copies is fine. The second jumps from page 118 to page 215, then after the index jumps back to page 151. The third skips from page 118 to to page 183, then after 214 skips back to 151.This book would've gotten four stars (great recipes and hints, but absence of pictures costs a point), but people ordering this book need to be on the lookout for similar printing errors."
1," Good game for young kids.: This game is great for fourth graders and younger, and for their parents too. Wonderful way to spark conversation from kids who will barely tell you what they did at school for the day. All of that said, you will tire of the game after awhile. Put it on the shelf, forget about it and then pull it down a year later to relive some fun.One way to extend the playability and to add some excitement is for everyone to make some of their own cards to add to the game. It's what we did with great success.If you don't have kids ten and younger you should think twice about getting the game."
1, Awesome product: Go to youtube and copy and paste in300 Gallon Plywood Tank - Build and Advice - CheapestLook for the video made by redneckcomputergeakI built this tank using this part it works great and has held up great
0, Color quality of DVD: I received the DVD and it seems to me that the color/ picture is very bright- almost like a white out through the whole movie. I bought it new or so I thought. I tested it on 2 DVD players with the same result.
1," I Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Book!: If you are even remotely interested in Cavalry operations during the Vietnam War buy this book. It is full of information that I have yet to see presented elsewhere. The photos of uniforms, patches and people all make this book a worthwhile addition to any person who is interested in Military history."
1," The best one so far: Easily the best volume of the three Avengers Essentials to date, we now see Rascally Roy Thomas at the scripting helm, along with Awesome John Buscema doing most of the art chores. Say no more! This duo is one of the greatest in comics lore... and even demi-gods Barry [Windsor] Smith and Gene Colan show up to help out on art.This collection contains the spectacular introduction of the Vision, the Avengers vs. the (old) X-Men, several battles with arch-foe Ultron, and the classic Avengers vs. Avengers thanks to the machinations of the time-spanning Scarlet Centurion. I'd give this compilation five stars, but the several issues featuring Hercules and the battles in god-ville are just plain dull. (Avengers #50 featured this crap? YEESH.) But don't let these few pages spoil the rest of the great fun."
0," worst book i ever read: Stay away from this book. It may be the worst book Iread. It is a bunch of cliches held together with overwrought writing. At first, I thought it was a satire, a take-off of hard-boiled badly written books. I got about halfway through this book, hoping it would get to the point, and then realized that it was to be taken seriously. Don't."
1," Fun: My wife loves this game, I catch myself watching it and getting into it like the typical male does. She love it. I bet kids would too."
0, Mr. Blue: TV broke 3 weeks ago. Sharp has a no return policy. Now suffering through the repair process. I deeply regret this purchase.
0," Incomplete story: I found this book to be a disappointment primarily because it left out the answer to an important question, ""Why is this cheese being moved so much?"" While it does address, in a humorous way, the basic characters we find within all organizations who resist change no matter what, those who are quick to adapt to change, etc., it leaves out the motivation of the ""cheese mover"", who seemingly moves the cheese frequently, without planning,logic or explanation. Consequently, the message I received from this book was that the best employees are those who go along with ""moving the cheese"" in a robotic, unquestioning way. I am dissapointed that this comes from such a recognized author and it runs counter to good management philosophy."
1, I'on know what i was on: I think I was still mad bout P fallin off or something because when this album first dropped i was like whut da hell. It didnt sound like the How U Luv That album back then. Now it sound like How U Luv That Vol.3. This is the best Big Tymer album. Solid beats and lyrics except Wayne being annoying on some tracks. Must have
1," amazing: they dont look like much, but they work extremely well.very impressed with those, they are ideal for posters but also heavier stuff."
1," I'm Hooked: I purchased a DS for my nephew, by brother and my mother. I finally decided to buy one for me. I'm hooked. I have several games to choose from. Some games click and some don't. When you find the one that does it's pretty much addicting. Everything is put on hold until I reach the next level. Get one, you'll love it! P.S. It's not just for those under 30. I'm 50+."
1, Makes great tasting coffee: I recently purchased the same coffee pot at Costco for 49.99!!! Extremely well made. I'm sure it will last a long time.
0," Discolored face after 2 uses: This things works ok, I suppose. But after only two uses, the glass on the face became discolored almost to the point of being unreadable."
1," Excellent Treatment of Christian Epistemology: Overall, I felt this was a very strong book from Frame. He addresses the epistemological issues of theology very well in a clear, precise, and cogent manner. Frame promotes his perspectivalism throughout the book as he emphasizes the unity and diversity we encounter in epistemology. I suppose I was expecting a more technical or philosophical treatment of the subject when I picked up the book and felt the book wasn't as technical as I had desired being that I have read much Van Til. Notwithstanding, this book is an excellent read and I would go so far as to say required reading for Christians seeking to get a better grasp of a Biblical worldview and hence its epistemology."
0," Can't Unlock: After being exposed to the elements for about a year, the combination became stuck and the Master Lock unopenable."
0," disappointed...........bad ending: This is one of the worst John Grisham's books and is the worst I've ever come across....Maybe it's because i don't like bad endings, but this is horribly unacceptable."
0, worthless without the answer key. where is it?: This may be an exceptional book but without the answer key it is useless. I can't believe you would not publish the key with the book!
0," travel detective: Sorry, but totally did not live up to my expectations! VERY disappointed. I wish I could recommend it, but just not that good!"
1," Wonderful Dishes!: I grew up with original Corelle dishes, and even though they are almost break-proof and stain-proof, I never liked the weight, feel and look of them. When I heard Corelle came out with their ""Ultra"" line, that are 70% thicker than original Corelle, I knew I had to have a set. I ordered two sets of the ""Autumn in Hanover"" pattern and they are wonderful. They do not look or feel like Corelle. They are the perfect weight and with two children, I don't have to worry about broken dishes anymore! They also stack up much nicer in my dishwasher then my old stoneware dishes, and they are easier to clean because the surface is smoother. Amazon.com had the best price I could find online, about $20.00 lower than other websites that carry the same dishes."
0, Does not pull in a signal where I live: I don't know if this is because of where I live or if it's just not a good product but I wouldn't recommend it. It's basically useless to me as a radio. It's fine as an alarm clock but if you want a radio you'd better keep looking. My mother has the same model and hers doesn't get a good signal either.
1," CW's best work to date: This is definitely Christopher Williams' best work to date. It is neo-classic soul at its best. It starts off with Dance which is a wonderful dance song. The album is pretty much mellow relaxing music. A great pick for those who like slow jams. Somebody, Real Men Do, Mary, and Flow are intoxicating. If you don't have this album, you need to get it and support real R&B."
0," A Disappointing Book: This book is neither an autobiography nor a systematic insight on computer industry. Instead, it is a sales pitch for the Microsoft's new business initiative on ""information superhighway"", which in others words -- the Internet. Consider the miserable performance of Microsoft today in the Internet domain more than 10 years after this book was published, this books feels like a joke, full of wishful thinking.What really bothers me is Gates' rambling on many random topics throughout this book. From politics to world hunger, the author does not have any new insight to offer to the reader, and simply repeats the general view of news agency. It reveals the shallowness of Bill Gates. Perhaps Bill Gates is a super-smart businessman, but he is such a lazy thinker.Do not expect to learn anything new from this book. This is nothing mentioned in this book that is not mentioned somewhere else."
0," Poor quality: This product was great for the few two weeks (comfortable, warm, and fairly light weight). Unfortunately, the inside liner quickly began to wear down, as did the arch support in the boot making them pretty uncomfortable to wear. I didn't want to buy a new pair of boots so I inserted a new insole. I continued wearing them for another month, in which time the sole of the shoe began to crack and pull away from the fabric of the boot. I waterproofed the boot when I first got them since I live in a snow belt, but that does no good if water can get into the boot through the sole. Ultimately, these boots left my feet cold, wet, and aching. If you are looking for a good winter boot for everyday walking in the snow, do NOT buy these boots!!! They seem to be made more for fashion than function."
0," Bait and Switch Foam Sleeve : Don't buy this product: What you see in the product picture and what you get are totally different items. This claims to be Shop Vac part number 905-85 ??? Take a look at the shopvacstore photo [...] ... Now take a look at [...] (linked from Amazon's site). The foam sleeve you get for this item doesn't even look as good as the one from [...].Fortunately Amazon has EXCELLENT customer service and return policies. I'd strongly suggest they review this vendor and ""tune-up"" their product listing to reflect reality and not a bait-and-switch product. I'm guessing most folks are too lazy to return a $6.00 item. I'm not."
0, I wish i had a cardboard box for every one who likes Masterp: THis album was as cardboard as it gets. If i were a shoe salesman i would put a pair of pumps on and throw it out the window. Have you ever ate ice cream from the Cardboard box? YO YO YO Props to my homie Royce Mcadular
1, GREAT MIRROR: What a great product. It looks very nice in our new bathroom. We use it every day. Highly recommend it.
0," Horrible: I mean, these bugs are located about 1/4 around the galaxy andthe ""brain bugs"" just shoot them toward Earth and they gethere in about a month! Voyager travels at around 413 times the speed of light and it's going to take them about 70 years to reach the Alpha Quadrant if they just used warp drive. They should have named this movie ""Beverly Hills 90210 Goes to Space."". If you like cheesy plots, and shallow characters, this is THE movie for you. About the only thing missing was Jim Varney (Ernest P. Worell) as a Starship Commander. Yeah, the satire was obvious in the ""propaganda news"" clips, but I really don't think intentionally making a movie this bad makes it a ""great movie"". Save you money and save yourself; don't watch this movie."
1," This book is an accurate portrayal!: I flew a lot of missions with the 281st Assault Helicopter Company in support of the Recondo School in Vietnam. I checked my logbook and might have brought Mr. Chambers back from Hon Tre Island and I was one of the pilots who inserted the striker company in support of his ""graduation exercise"". My call sign was Bandit 23.Excellent book!"
1," Great movie: A few years ago my husband and I watched this movie for the first time on HBO. We taped it just in case it would turn out to be a good one. We watched it many times since, and I thought it was time to buy it before our copy would finally give up and ""die"" on us. Boy, was I surprized to see that it wasn't in print. I got up right away to brake the safety tab out of the cassette to make sure nobody is taping over it by accident. Lets hope it will become available again soon."
0," Hard to see: Bought this for my elderly father who loves these games, but the cards and labels on this was too small for him to see and use. Directions were a little more involved than necessary"
1, Great fun for children!: Parents now have the opportunity to include their children on their bike rides. Great family time. Years back you could never see your kids without glancing behind you. Much more reassuring that your child is safe. My granddaughter gets a front row seat. She loves it!
0," poor quality control: I purchased a Line Pod a while back. The first thing I noticed was the sound of a loose screw rattling around inside. Later, after only about 30 hours of use, the effects started fading in and out. It's now to the point where the effects are not produced and I've given up using the Pod and I just now feed my guitar directly into my amp. Needless to say I've been very disapointed with this purchase."
1," Great for eyebrows & ear hair! Compact & reliable!: I've owned this trimmer for a few years. My spouse & I both love it. The attachment is perfect for eyebrows. It's also great for trimming wayward ear hairs. That's really all we use it for. I only recently finally changed the battery because it sounded like the motor was slowing. It's been reliable & is well made. Since it's about the size of a tube of mascara, it's easy to take on trips or even slip in a purse. The trimmer & attachment both fit in the handy travel pouch. Love it!"
1, Almost Perfect!!!: Very Fast shipping. Product arrived in perfect condition. Pins were a perfect fit. Washers were all same size there should be one slightly larger than the other per set... No big deal though.... since the washers do not move for proper door functionality I simply wrapped the smaller washer with electrical tape to give it a snugg fit and it works perfectly fine.... other than that small but fixable detail ... Perfect!!
1," Heinrich Himmler, Anatomy of a Mass Murderer: Excellent insight into the mind of a mass murderer. This is an interesting film and very informative for any history buff."
1," Excellent: This pocket manual really does contain everything you could possibly need for an excellent pocket reference during your internal medicine rotation. Also clearly references the larger text, in case you want even more information."
0," Not worth the money: Actually, I did not pay for this book, because a friend gave it to me as a shower gift, but the book is not worth the money because its content is so limited. I get the feeling that the author was trying to stretch his material because as another reviewer mentioned you see the same room again and again. I guess some people buy this thin book because the author is said to have a TV show, but I work and have never seen it, so I'm not sure of this author's qualifications."
1," Not a baby wrapping expert, but...: This is a very cute book on baby wrapping, even if you do have to adjust the fabric requirements. There are a lot of useful ideas that can make carrying your baby around with you a reality."
0," Does not fit on a regular wood Browning Gold 12, just Synthetic type: This HiViz XCoil Browning Gold PreFit Recoil Pad does not fit on a regular wood Browning Gold but just on a Synthetic type. I hope I knew it before buying this as a gift, very disappointed with the product."
0," A poorly written book!: I applauded Dr. Perricone's efforts in writing this book. However, I was shocked to see how poorly the book was written for a person of his educational level, an M.D? Some Page 63 has an incomplete and fragmented sentence. He needed to specify the ranges of the glycemic index. That is, what is low, 55 or less? What is high, 70 and above?I'm also disgusted about his endorsement of certain skin care companies.I would strong recommend the Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health instead because it is a well written book. Read pages 99-101 regarding the glycemic index."
1," Great product.: 8 inputs, all component or composite plus audio. One output with dual audio, component and composite video. Buttons on the front, easily labelled. Works well and quite cheap. Remote too. Very impressed."
1," Strong historical survey: This is a very accessible, readable history, but it's extremely thorough, and useful for many applications. Highly recommended."
1," Melancholic, soothing music: I have the lucky chance to find out about this group in Paris and was immediately taken by their music. This is not 'ranchero' music...it is melancholic, soothing, sweet music. This group is comprised of at least 2 generations of musicians and their love of the craft is evident."
0," This product does not deliver: This product is unable to charge my Ipod and play something from my Ipod at the same time. Every time I dock my Ipod on this product, my Ipod battery gets fried. I can only play my Ipod with this device, if my Ipod is not docked there. And even with that, sometimes the sound is pretty good. Sometimes it is not. Please know that if you choose to purchase this item because it is cheap, you are doing so at your own risk. After all, you get what you pay for."
0, Zumba Power: I didn't see anything in the description that said the 2 DVD's I purchased were in spanish. I would NEVER have purchased them. I just started taking classes and was so excited to get the DVD's so I could practice the new moves but after trying to get a little more workout time with these DVD's I am TOTALLY confused and very discouraged.
0," Not Clever or Hilarious: Although there are three blubs on the back cover of this book laudings its""hyperliterate wit"" I found nothing even mildly amusing and I do read a lot of contemporary poetry. I've read at least ten books in the last three months. Compared to Bob Hicock or Dean Young or Joshua Clover or Steve Venright or anyone else I've read recently, but for a few pieces this writing left me cold."
0," i wanted a pill splitter: I PICKED THE WORNG PRODUCT :( IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SPLITTR FUNCTION, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ODD BECAUSE MANY PRODUCTS ARE DUAL FUNCTION..."
1, Excellent pump: Pump works great and excellent price. It got really good ratings in other sites as well as here. Well worth it.
0," Faulty Disk: I was so disappointed when the product was damaged. I have sent the faulty disk in for a replacment to Simon and Schurster weeks ago. The lanuage courses build on themselfs, so I'm at a stand still until I receive the replacment and we plan to travel in a month so that doesnt leave me much time."
1," Beautiful!: This is by far my favorite lullaby CD. Beautiful is the best way to describe it. Each song has such meaningful lyrics, and they are so unique. I'd never heard any of these songs before. The first time I heard ""My Dream Come True"" I honestly cried."
1," Currie shines: Justin Currie's song writing really shines on this album. After a lack-luster major label debut, ""Waking Hours"" is a pop-bomb. While this album is certainly Scot-pop-rock at its best, it is much deeper than that. Maybe it's something in the description of a hometown that's dying from the inside out, or of a relationship that's rotting like a tomato left to long on the vine, but Justin Currie's lyrics cut right to the bone.""I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead/So if this Taxi's for hire/I'll get in the back/just to feel the friction of the tarmac and the tires""When a songwriter can peel a page out of you mental diary and put it to music so eloquently, even thought it can be tragically depressing, how can you not love it.While this album definately has a late-80's feel, musically and lyrically, it shines"
1, Nice but HEAVY watch: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Automatic Diver's Watch #3035This is a very good looking watch & keeps good time. It was much thicker and heavier than what I was looking for. Without luminous hands and hour markers it's hard to see at night. It would have been nice if the description had said that this watch needed a special tool to adjust the band.
1," A Very Good Book to learn Ancient Mongolian Culture or about Chingiss Khan: Very good reading about the Life and Times of Chingiss Khan. Very good background of his life and all of the conquered nations under his lineage. Near the end of the book also discusses Khubalai Khan and his background and conquests. At times, it becomes tedious to read but overall, an excellent book."
0," Doesn't hold decanter securely: I'm perplexed by the other reviews, or possibly I just have a bad one but I find the tip on the end of this is very slippery and does not function to hold the decanter securely well at all. I had been using it until the other day when you guessed it, the decanter slipped and cracked up it's side as it went. I cannot recommend."
0," False advertising: The product description says the fridge can cool 40 degrees below ambient room temperature. The packaging on the product, which I received today, says 20 degrees below room temperature. I am very frustrated, and of course there is no information in the package that lets me know how to return the product, etc."
0," Poorly Produced: First off, I want to say the Band sounds good and could still play well. However, the production value of the DVD is atrocious. It seems they had no idea as to the arrangement of the songs as indicated by the camera cuts. The sound is poor. It feels as if a few mics were placed near the PA, which is a poorly conceived idea. This was an MTV production in their early years. I don't think they had a clue! Its too bad because it would be nice to have a visual documentation of a terrific band who could still deliver these great songs live! I was very disappointed."
0," Not for me: Watched the short clip, I did not like it at all and would never watch this series, not for me."
1," Love it!: I recieved the Kindle as a Christmas present and I love it. No more running to the bookstore or having to wait for the mailman to come to get the next book in a series. You can also buy decal ""skins"" from Amazon if your interested in dressing it up a bit. Thin enough to fit nicely in a purse. I take mine everywhere. Battery life is also very good."
1, Well done.: Stayed very true to the books and a great cast as well as fantastic scenery. Enjoyed every minute of the shows.
0, Thumbs down...Horrible Movie.: Not what we expected....poor acting poor movie in general. Nicolas Cage's career is over. Terrible Flick!
0," Stars in your eyes: Now, this magazine is good if you are looking for information on todays pop stars. But I personally don't like it. The magazine is nothing more than a star obbsessed read. When I read a magazine I want to read about fun, helpful life articles and this definetley is not it. If you are looking for Pop stars than this is for you but if you are looking for something with a little less star appeal and a bit more realism this magazine isn't for you. And I am one of those people."
0, Why not extended??: I was so excited when I saw they were finally releasing LOTR on Blu-ray now I am just bummed that it is not the extended addition!!! What a waste of time and money!!!
0," Piece of junk: I guess I have been lucky in the past. I buy an electronic device, it works, I'm happy and life is good. This, however, never worked from day one."
1," Eat, Pray, Love: I loved this book. I laughted and cried through out and could not put it down. I especially loved reading about Gilbert's experiences in Indonesia. I wish I could take this trip and discover myself as she did!"
0," Not all pieces included when purchased on Amazon: The as seen on TV commercial for this item shows that it includes a hanging bracket, it also mentions lifetime free replacement trimmer cord. The box the item came in also mentions the hanging bracket but according to the website for the product, neither are included when purchasedon Amazon. If I had know that I would NOT have purchased it via Amazon but used the items website for ordering. I suggest people look carefully before purchasing items on Amazon as it appears they are NOT all created equal!"
0," DO YOU LIKE TOUCHING YOUR FOREHEAD???: Not very many ""belly"" moves. alot of low hoping and forehead touching. Yes its a good workout, yes the music is nice, yes I got bored really fast. used it twice!"
1," Breathtaking and unbelievable-The ultimate love story: Words cannot begin to describe the emotional impact of this movie. I just purchased the ""James Cameron's Titanic"" after a long wait due to backorder. I have not had time to read it from cover to cover but have skimmed the pages. It is a wonderful photographical view of the movie. Included are lines from the movie (I think I have half the dialogue memorized from the movie after seeing it four times thus far), comments from the actors and the producers. The photographs couldn't be better. This movie truly deserves all the credit it has received and more. I fully believe that this is the movie of all time for many decades to come and many that have past. Every detail of it is exquisitely done! I feel so fortunate to have been in the audience and experienced the ""aura"" of ""Titanic""!"
1," Best Price for an Excellent Magazine: I am an older geek (demographically I am probably very OLD compared to the average WIRED reader) who enjoys staying informed about emerging and fast-evolving technology of every type/sort/ilk. Unlike other hard-tech magazines I read, WIRED is unique in that it places a ""human"" face on technology, no matter how razor-edged it might be. How many tech and/or hard science magazines even pretend to present the ""big picture""? Humans are developing tech at a furious rate, and WIRED helps me ponder tech's implications/impact on society, the environment, finance, etc. Yes, I am interested not only in tech, but in hard and soft sciences, socio-economics, politics and other arenas which impact our world. WIRED satisfies all these interests."
1," Great read!: As a Southern Baptist, I had always heard of Lottie Moon, but never actually heard the story of Lottie Moon and her life as a missionary. Great read! This was a very easy read and is something that I can read aloud to my children until they are old enough to read it on their own. I would say, read aloud to children age 6 and up. Easy read for adults, you won't be able to put it down!"
0," Overly dramatic: Marozzi keeps using phrases such as gold and precious stones, and uses repetitive dramatic language to describe every battle. The book is interesting in spite of the unsophisticated writing."
1," Good but not the best: I Really like Black Dawn,but Soulmate was my favorite.I hope after Witchlight, she[L.J.Smith] writes a book that has to do with all the Circle Daybreak members.I also love when soulmatesfind each other.I to hope L.J.Smith writes morebooks.Like I said,Soulmate was my favorite.Black Dawn was my third favorite.GOOOOL.J.Smith write more great books.And if Your getting tierd of Soulmates finding each otherthen find other books to read."
1, Great Book New Edition Needed: The Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook (6th Edition). great book. the best of its kind. but when will the 7th edition come out?. the world is waiting for the new edition.
1, make up optional: Great product but I Still have residual makeup/dirt after washing with cleanser and need a toner for the rest.
0, Did not last: Installed and used one day then heard loud pop and no more picture. Not pleased with this bulb. Might try a different company
1," GREAT: i loved it it is one of the best books i have ever read in fact my family and friends keep stealing it on me they love it ""now i just need to show them jthm"""
0," Charger: Doesn't charge my iPhone quickly, the ripcord does not lock into place when extended, for the price it does it's job"
1," Excellent piece of work: I'm impressed with the functions of this Weather Station, its large display and its outdoor temp alongwith the moon phases. I like it."
1," 2 Year Old Loves It!: I recently bought these for my 2 year old daughter and she hasn't stopped playing with them yet. The dolls each come with two outfits, her favorite is the Ariel doll and her mermaid tail. I plan on getting more favorite moments in the future."
1," Good but hard!: This is one of the hardest games I have ever played! Even for a Harry Potter game (which are usually fairly easy). The dementors don't do much though. What I really hate is that Harry has to go into the basement to get rat tonic for Ron's rat. Why can't Ron just get it himself? The game is really cool, though I wish you could hit Snape with that expelliarmus spell like Harry did in the movie."
1," Telling u ive see it 100 times still am not tired!: Oh god we were ready me and my friends to see this! We all drove out to the nearest theatre and saw this for then we all saw the others in the series that night! We all saw that this was our fav. it is a spitting image of us! Though we are not bad influncers! He He! This not only has Freddy but my fav. Jason! Both together... in the ultimate battle! Funny, scary, what else?... Everything! This is my nightmare! Now were waiting for teh sequal! It will be directed by Sam Ramani fyi....... he directed the Evil Deads and Darkman and hero Bruce Campbell from the Evil Deads! This is going to be great! 9, 10, another is coming back again!"
1," Absolute must for every horse lovers library: As a 14 yr old rider of 5 yrs, I found this book unreplaceable. It has information on anything you wish to know about. Throughout the book, the authors display their love and knowledge of horses though their passionate reviews and writings. This book comes equipped with many many colour photos, to keep the reader's interest and confirm the writings. Beware though, this book is not about learing to ride and looking after horses. It is about the magnificent history, anatomy, behaviour and evolution of the mighty horse. Part 1 is about the natural history of the horse, Part 2 about the historical relationship of horse and man, Part 3 tells of horse and man today, the various disciplines and sports, and Part 4 has a much-needed glossary. A must for the tack room and every riding school. Worth every cent."
0," Please pass this one by...: What a disappointment. Wish I knew what Roger Corman had to do with them. We watched several and he was not mentioned in the credits at all. To add insult to injury, disk #3 was damaged and glitchy. We thought that all the movies needed a guy in a rubber monster suit to improve them. This is a virtually unwatchable set. We love Roger Corman movies and have the best of the worst. This is awful. It was about 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. I would have rather changed the litter box. Twice."
1, Must Have: This cd is definitely a must have. All of the songs on the cd urge you to enter into a state of worshiping God. Even my 6 yr old son loves the cd.
0, Does not work!: This tape was advertised to stop slippage on any surface. I used it on runners over hard flooring and carpeting. We are tripping over these runners all the time - very annoying and dangerous. Do not waste your money.
0," Don't buy it on the Kindle!: I've seen this book at the library and wanted a copy for myself. When I saw the Kindle version, I decided to purchase it. I regret doing so. No where in the description for the Kindle edition did it say that all of the photos were in black and white. Since I've seen the actual book, I know that the pictures were in color and good quality. All of the pictures in the Kindle version are black and white and have poor contrast. If you count on having good pictures to do needlework, don't buy the Kindle version of this book - buy the print version."
1," The only dress shoes that my husband wears: My husband is tall and has relatively narrow and bony feet. He had tried many other shoes before finally settling on this one. These shoes fit comfortably and give sufficient support. They are practically the only dress shoes that he wears, which has made my life so easy when it comes to gift-shopping! We would definitely recommend these shoes to others."
1," A Must-Have!: I used to have several HTML and Web Design books beside my computer. Now, I don't pile as many books as before because Web Design in a Nutshell guides me through. It talks about almost everything you need to know on how to put up a decent website-- the web environment, HTML, graphics, multimedia and interactivity, and the emerging technologies. It is a handy reference-- organized and easy-to-read. A must-have beside your computer."
1," THE BEST KNITTING PATTERN SET: This is by far the BEST set of knitting patterns I've seen so far.I just received it and I'm looking forward to doing all the January ones already.I'm a medium level knitter and feel confident I can follow the patterns and stitches. The more complicated ones will encourage me to find someone to teach me or seek out a knitting class to be able to knit the available patterns.The patterns are easy to read, and the photos are clear with vibrant colors which really make the stitches and patterns stand out.I would highly highly recommend this calendar simply as a reference or a new way to learn a pattern a day. Brilliant marketing idea."
1, Good value.: This is a wonderful resource for preparing for the CCRN exam. Allows enough detail for a better comprehension of presented materials.
0," Not Free SF Reader: A dense book, with the writer throwing a lot of stuff in. Presumably meant to be a literary fancy pants type of thing, but to me, that just made it incredibly dull and a slog to get anywhere near through much of it.Definitely not entertaining in the way Robert Anton Wilson is, for example."
0," Rather disappointing: I bought this item instead of a competitors less expensive model due to the reports I read concerning the matching of the coloring. Also, the manufacturer claims that their wiring is superior and stays connected. I had the power lead pull out during the initial install, another came loose 6 months later and the rear window defroster still isn't wired since three of the four wires were off in the packaging when received. I emailed the manufacturer who said they had no diagram and were unable to assist me in getting them on the correct pins. I would have been better off paying less for the competition and taking a chance on the coloring and texture matching."
1," Bench Dog 40-031 ProMax Cast Iron Router Table/Table Saw Ext: Just installed the 40-031 on my Rigid TS2424 as part of a 12"" left/36"" right cutting capacity conversion. Installation was easy (less than an hour) and it makes a great addition to my shop.....plus it save space! Highly recommend it!"
1," Powerful: This is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. A true testiment to just what humans can endure to survive. Rena is an example of the best qualities of humanity, she survived along with her sister but never sacrificed another human to achieve that survival. I would have loved to know this lady and to have absorbed some of her outlooks on life."
1," Better than the movie: Everything that was great in the movie, plus more!!! A very quick read, but the kind of book you can read again and again! Truly Great!"
0, James Patterson Thomas Berryman: Very poor quality not as stated pages just bearly hanging in well used not as stated. Very dissappointed. Review not on the book but the seller. Book as always James Patterson never fails...
0, Very Noisy: The fan is very noisy and vibrates a lot when it is oscillating.Also I did not see any thermostat with the fan which I saw it one of the reviews for it.Also the customer service number does not work.Overall dissatisfied. Thinking of returning it
1," Great Movie & Wonderful Music: This was a wonderful fun movie and the sound tract is terrific! I went right home from seeing the movie and found the soundtract on Amazon.com. I was enjoying it at home within three days of seeing the movie. It has some well known opera pieces along with some really cute mambo & french pieces. All in all it is a pleasant listen experience! See the movie and then enjoy the soundtract! I can't wait for the movie to be available, would love to see it again. Amazon is amazing....they always have it all and have it to me in short order ENJOY >^..^<"
0," interesting: placed my order with amazon 11/15, and it still hasn't been shipped out. Lousy service !"
0, One of the disk cannot play in my DVD plays: The show is great. But one of the disk I bought cannot correctly played in my DVD player. It gave a big crash noise. I had to stop it. I am wondering whether Amazon can send me a new copy.Shuang
1, Works Great!: We are on our second broken foot in a year and the product continues to work great. Well worth the money!
0," Poor excuse for a Christian book!: ""What has happened the Christian community?? This is one of the worst books I've read. Right from the start Eldredge claims that Bible Study is boring. That has not been my experience when learning about our God! Then he goes on to say that God called an evil infested creation ""Good"". Eldredge has created for himself a god that is different than the God of the Bible. God called His creation ""Good"" BEFORE sin entered. The ""wildness"" that Eldredge relishes is a result of sin. Next he completely denies the Omniscience of God. To state that ""God took a risk"" is to imply that God does not know the outcome. That is a denial of the God of the Bible. I'm greatly saddened by the popularity of this book! I'm greatly saddened by the state of God's people"
0, Mastery of your anxiety and panic by Barlow and Craske: The copy I received of this book was upside down and backword print. I was told it was the only one left in print so I was stuck with it or a refund and send it back. I decided to keep it but had a tough time reading it!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope my next experience is better with amazon. Unhappily yours Gail Mauer
0, Above and Beyond: Unable to view this as can not be read in the UK. Is there not another version which can be read here and if so why was it not sent to me?
0, Poor Calista!: This is a truly terrible movie and the only reason that it got released on video at all is that Calista Flockhart got famous! Save your money!
0," Not well done: AGORA was not well presented. The characters were not fully developed, the story misrepresented historical facts, the camera work was not exceptional and the scenes were at times disjointed. The average viewer may find the setting and historical background confusing. I would not recommend this film."
1," Sturdy, lifetime blender: This blender is fabulous. Although pretty expensive, I wouldn't recommend anything else. My favorite feature of this blender is the blades. They are super heavy and thick, and they are not sharp as with other cheaper blenders. Secondly, there is no mistaking when the blender jar is placed correctly on the base because of the construction of the base of the jar. Lastly, the blender starts every cycle with a ""stir"" setting as to not throw food up into the lid. I would definetely recommend this blender as well as any other Kitchenaid product. It's worth the extra cash to own the best."
0," Nice piece of Junk: I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend. I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it. The display, contrast and brightness were great.However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny. They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage. Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue. In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons."
1, John Wayne movies are timeless: Great story line -- lots of drama; great actors; LOTS of familiar character actors. Very fun movie. Family friendly; no foul language.
1," If you only buy one pregnancy book, buy this one: I'm an OB nurse and this is the book I buy for my pregnant friends! It presents information you can't find anywhere else and keeps you laughing the whole way through. The style is contemporary and hip and will make you laugh at things no one has ever given you permission to laugh at before."
0," This movie is serious...seriously lame.: I've seen B movies in my time, but this one doesn't even qualify to be in that category. The only redeeming part of this movie is Mark Hamill's well delivered 20 minutes of acting. Oh, and Melissa Galianos is kind of cute. Full of cliche lines, sub par plots, and a cheesy ending, this movie is something you can mock for ages to come."
1," Unique and interesting highlander novel: This is a unique highlander novel that I am happy I picked up. Started slow, but became interesting very quickly. Cool plot, nice details, and easy to follow. Hero is perfectly savage, heroine is gracefully solid, and all the characters are steadfast. The intimate scenes (and those leading up to) were well-written. Fabulous light read. I usually prefer my novels with a lot of suspense and action, but as a strictly ""romance"" novel, it was good."
1," Glad I took the plunge!: I admit the price kept these in my cart...for too long. They feel amazing on the skin, fit well and are extremely comfortable. As others have stated, get over the sticker shock and get a pair. I think I am going to get another."
0," STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is the first time I have ever felt ripped off on an Amazon purchase. I have never given a book 1 star and frankly it doesn't deserve that.The ""book"" consists of 20 pages of actual material which for the most part is useless since he doesn't explain any of his ""techniques"" except to refer you to one of his many books from "" The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System"" to ""Investing in En Primeur Wine"".The rest of the ""book"" consists of 82 pages of appendices and another 12 pages of the authors books along with summaries for additional filler.I'm glad I only got ripped off for 20 bucks. Don't be the next victim."
0, NICE LOOKING - BUT NO ICE: Internal components are plastic. Ice maker worked great for about a month and the ice lifting mechanism is plastic and broke. Amazon will only refund 50% of the purchase price and I have to pay shipping. If you are looking for an Ice Maker pass on this one as it's internal components will break. Too bad - really liked the looks of the unit...
1," Perfect for moms considering home births!: I purchased this video for my Child Development class at a large suburban high school. The birth process was very graphic at times; I was surprised how squeemish some of the students got. However, it was a valuable learning tool and very informative."
0," NO, NO, NO....: No, no, no.... One of the biggest disappointments I've ever owned. Not the Steve Cropper you know and love. No soul, or skill for that matter. Horrible, high-schoolish horn arrangements. The titles look tasty but beware. Lotta Help, not Little Help is needed.Spend your money on the Booker T Box Set. Or if you're looking for Cropper satisfaction, get Steve Cropper, Pop Staples and Albert King - Jammed Together... A very great CD. Everything Little Help ain't.Speaking of spending your money - Go out and SEE and HEAR Booker T. The here and now, live and luscious."
0," GHOST GAME DVD REVIEW 1/5: This movie actually had potential (in the beginning) for a mediocre straight-to-DVD horror film. However, too much bad acting was present throughout most of the movie and the screenplay was brainless. Only watch this movie if you have nothing else to do. Overall, it's not really bad, there are a number of films far more insufficient than this."
1," Good introductory to Pauline theology: This study takes Godet's thoughts on the New Testament and narrows the scope specifically to Paul and his doctrinal stances. It's more of a generalized summary on Paul's letters, and doesn't get very deep or overly technical. It's a good resource for introductory level Bible students looking to go deeper into the Word. I recommend this with his other study on the New Testament, which covers tother themes and the four Gospels. Both are great suppliments for busy pastors.For the serious study on Paul, Godet's commentaries on 1 St Corinthians and Romans are excellent, but are decidely for those with an aptitude for Greek."
1," better for biz travellers: if you travel 2-5 days a week, the shuffle is the way to go - you can put just enough music on it for the week and then reload it on the weekends"
0," Labor intensive: I tried the Demo and while a cool looking game, it is way to labor intensive. Power/mass consumption is way out of line. I had 22 generators, 5 mass extrators and 8 mass fabricators with only a land factory and air factory and 5 defensive guns. Nothing else but it would not keep up with power and mass ??? I got overrun by the computer on EASY. Not fun."
0," It is big, I'll admit that...: A massive work. I appreciate the amount of work and research that went into compiling this stuff. But it is organized in an almost completely useless way. Unless you know exactly what you're looking for, you will be very unlikely to find anything in this rambling 900 plus page doorstop. I was doing research for a script I'm working on. Well the book's index is arranged alphabetically. Almost completely useless.Want to know about specific folklore? Forget it. Unless you know the title of the book, movie or person, you're screwed.There are much better ways to learn about Vampires. This is a reference book for someone who already knows exactly what to look for. And once you know that, you don't need this book at all.Waste of money and time."
0, Devastating Loss: Went corrupt and I lost very important pictures. Don't take the chance with Viking CompactFlash Cards
0," Does seem a bit much for six episodes: I recall the Swamp Fox being pretty good but Efega Bacca being fairly routine. And when are they going to release Dr Syn, Alias the Scarecrow aka The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh??? I'd pay the price for that three episode set!"
0," What an incredible disappointment after ""The Alienist""!!: As a person who raved to her coworkers and friends relentlessly about ""The Alienist"" being one of the best books of the past 5 years, I was overwhelmingly disappointed by ""The Angel of Darkness."" The story of Libby Hatch was intriguing, but the book plodded on and on until I was begging for it to be over. I normally would not even stay with a book that slow, but knowing Carr's previous work, I assumed there HAD to be something better coming. Perhaps if ""Angel"" had been a tighter, less rambling 350 pages or so instead of 750, it might have been enjoyable."
1," Perfect Combination: Pride of Lions is the latest rock project by Jim Peterik(ex Survivor) as well as sensational debut for 25-year-old Toby Hitchcock who has amazing vocal range. Band name came from the concept that great rock legend has been handed down to younger generation. Toby Hitchcock has brilliant voice some of the greatest legendary male vocalists combined. What's good about him is that his voice comes smooth no matter how low and how high the tone. Given such flexible voice Jim Peterik's song arrangement became much aggressive and brilliant than anything else he has done so far. It includes excellent songs such as Sound Of Home, Gone, and Interrupted Melody. Hard-edged Unbreakable and It's Criminal reminds me a bit of Survivor. Last Safe Place can be made into excellent duet or could well be covered by some of the excellent female vocalists such as Avril Lavigne, Amy Lee(Evanescence) and Michelle Branch.It is highly commercial and wild responce in US is much anticipated."
1," Willoughby?: Clearly, the Willoughby in the Emma Thompson ""Sense and Sensibility"" was hard to equal. I thought this one was a bit too effeminate."
1, the life stone of singing bird: I was in the time and space with these characters while my imagination wondered and wandered which created a beautiful reading experience for me.
1," Intelligently produced!: Being a slow learner without patience, I find this series very encouraging. It progresses fast but you can replay as you go. I was able to follow the teacher and get a few steps in my feet in no time. It was like being in a tap dance class and being able to zoom in to check the details without other students blocking your view. I recommend Tap with Ginger without reservation."
0, Weak.: I am a fan of Terry Brooks but this was very disappointing. Maybe its because I just finished a Storm of Swords by George R. R. Martin which is 10 stars.
1," Much More Than I Expected!! AWESOME!!: I was a Chris Daughtry fan all along but I was really glad he got voted off. He was able to pursue his own ""stuff"" and not American Idol songs.This is a terrific CD. I love it!"
0," DOES NOT WORK WITH ALL PHONES!!!: It says it works with all phones, but it dosn't!! In fact it dosen't even fit any of my friends phones! I have a ""V series 2397 motorola"". I've not been able to find the correct adapter anywhere on the web or in town. I've tried everything, I'm almost going to give up on this issue. - Micxz"
1," Just as cool as the other glasses they make.: Basically, these glasses are as good as you can imagine them to be. Look at them, don't they look cool? Yes, they're that cool. I use them for coffee cups and my only complaint is that when I pick up the cup of coffee I don't realize how hot it is and then I'm surprised how hot my coffee is when I drink it. Yes, I'm an idiot. Still, damn great glasses."
0," mistakes: I am currently a medical student, and Physiology is on our required texts list. It's an awful read. Very dry, very dense. Difficult to keep interested from one scattered clinical tidbit to the next. PLUS, there were multiple mistakes in just the few chapters I made myself go through. Thinking about petitioning for a new text listing for next year's class..."
1," Promise Me Tomorrow: This is the second book of a 3-book series. The first one is ""A stolen heart"" and the third book is ""No other love"". The characters of her books are vividly written and seemingly alive. I have read all three and this book is just incredible. The story of the series is about three brother and sisters who were separated since they were young. Will they find each other? Read the whole series and find out for yourself."
0," Disappointing: The hide n seek care bear really wasn't all it was made out to be. My kids played with it, with my husband, on Christmas, and they all gave up after 5 minutes. It was giving out wrong directions, and just wasn't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek. So my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it's an ordinary stuffed animal--an rather expensive stuffed animal!"
0," Buy USA products!: Would have bought this set but product description states it was made in China. Found a different camping dish set on Amazon made in USA that the whole family loves, its made by Preserve and is available in several different colors and is made from recycled plastic. Its not only good for our environment, its also made right here in the USA! Preserve also makes other kitchen products that are good for everyday use, my family loves them!"
1," A Book to be read over and over: This is a book about an ordinary situation with extraordinary quirks. Alice White is a werewolf. She seeks out someone who can help her and ends up with shrink. Of course he believes her to be delusional but, quite fascinating. Alice tries to keep everyone at arms lenth for fear of what the truth will do to them and her. Along the way, she meets and falls for a wonderful professor, Erik Summers, and hopes that he'll be the one that accepts her for all she is....Of course that is when things get complicated. This book so honestly depicts relationships that you hardly notice that one of the factors involved is the fact that Alice is a werewolf.It's really a great book. It is the ONLY book I have read 4 times and refuse to let others borrow in fear I may never get it back."
1," The Deftones, once local to Sacramento,Ca, rock the world.: Around the Fur is an awesome release from the Deftones. With songs like ""My own Summer"" and ""Be Quiet And Drive(Far Away)"" how can anyone not like this. And who could forget the opening to ""Around the Fur""! The Deftones started in Sacramento, but are not rocking the world with their awesome music"
0," Worst Movie I Ever Saw: This is the 'only' movie that I ever walked out of before the ending. Unfortunately, yes... it was that bad. By far the worst movie that I ever had the distinct displeasure of enduring. Complete waste of my time. Is it possible to give it a rating lower than 1 star? Caveat emptor."
0," good idea, not yet there...: Another failed try! Let's see, if we want to replace paper books and save the Amazon rainforest; the technology is here: e-ink. The Sony e-reader and the Iliad by irex.com were the first. But, wow! amazon.com didn't review the previous and just made another try! Price is VERY expensive, first drawback. But the worst is this: no open to external formats!Dear Jeff; you must find a way to sell your e-books safetly trough the web site and let the Kindle read any other files from a PC. I guess the point is to control that the e-books aren't craked and fall in file swapping sites like emule like mp3 music.But have in mind soon you'll see a Chinese made e-reader open to all formats by 99,99.The point is to create crack proof e-books (hard task).Is a matter of software.Then the e-ink revolution will kill paper books."
1," Destined to become a collector's item: This book contains the entire magickal curriculum of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn as it exists today. Its author David Griffin, Chief Adept of Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, has been reported as saying that when this limited deluxe edition sells out soon, that there will be no further editions of this invaluable work. This means that the Ritual Magic Manual by David Griffin will soon become one of the most valuable and sought after collector's items in magickal history! The news on the street in the magickal community is that, once this limited edition sells out, its content will then become available exclusively on-line, and only to on-line members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn inside the Cyber-Temple at their golden-dawn.com web site. I am glad that I already have my copy and would reccommend every serious student of ritual magick to get this book while they still can. This classic work is bound to become a collector's dream come true!"
0," Colossal waste of time/money.: This book is the worst attempt at conveying information in a readable manner. It has typeos throughout. Written in German, translated to English. It's a dinosaur. This 3rd edition is from 1999. I can't believe that my class assigned this to the class as our only source of course material. The examples show only portions of what they're trying to explain, there isn't much on the net to clarify the examples, so you're pretty much on your own. The teacher actually called this book ""a piece of crap"" and blames it's use on the university. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. And I like BPM, a lot. Was looking forward to taking this class, but it's money down the drain."
1," A Wonderful Book!: This great book by L.M. Montgomery touched my heart deeply the first time I read it and even after reading it MULTIPLE times it still tugs at my heartstrings. It's a book about simpler times, love of the Lord, family and home. There are also many love stories in the book. You'll root for some lovers and grit your teeth at others. Be sure to also read Mistress Pat."
0," Not one of Ann's best book (in my opinion): I have read every book that Ann Rule has written, and usually can't wait to read her next book. This was no exception. I purchased, but for the first time, found it difficult to follow, with too many details. It took me awhile to finally finish the book, when I usually read it in two days. I have given every other book by her 5 stars."
1, A Classic!: This is a must have for anyone's comedy collection! Spies Like Us is a classic. Nothing But Trouble is just so-so.
0," Generic and Uninspiring: This film version of the great St. Anthony of Padua is quite disappointing in that it misses the real essence of this incredible saint, and presents him as some kind of ""revolutionary"" and corruption seeker, even going after Church officials, etc.Sorry, the real Saint Anthony was a very holy, learned man who loved God and man devoutly and wholeheartedly, a deeply spiritual,prayerful man whose closeness to almighty God gave him even miraculous powers to heal the sick, raise the dead, and convert the most hardened sinners. He was not a ""warrior"" or a ""revolutionary"" - he was a great Saint, one who closely imitated Christ.A much better film version is the film ""SAINT ANTHONY"", starring Italian actor Daniele Liotti, also available on Amazon."
0," do not see what the big deal is: Perhaps a portion of my misfortune was the years of hype the preceded me actually viewing this film.While it was interesting I found the character developement to be inadequate to lock in interest. The movie just seemed to pass time. It somewhat reminded me of the movie ""GO"" how you got to see the same 30 minutes over and over again.While the style was neat, this movie had little to offer beyond a few of the opening comments."
0," Loved these for 16 years, now they're worthless.: The uni-ball micro rollers were the only pen I used for about 16 years, and I loved them. I always have a few in every backpack, coat, desk, and car. They were smooth and dark and writing with them made me feel smart and creative.And now, they're worthless.I just ordered two new boxes, which is my usual behavior whenever I find there aren't a few immediately at hand in the usual locations. The box now has a ""helps prevent check fraud"" label. Indeed, I don't imagine anyone can commit check fraud with PENS THAT DON'T WORK.The ink is not as dark, it doesn't flow as well when they are working, and they STOP WORKING ENTIRELY and scratch emptily across the page within 5 minutes of writing.So I just angrily threw both new boxes in the garbage. I'm not upset about the wasted $16, I'm upset that now, after so many loyal years, I have to find a new brand."
0, O.K Book: The book was about a girl name Karana. She was stranded on the Island of the Blue Dolphins for a number of years.The book was good because she did not have any body to talk tobut her animals.
0," Wireless Doorbell: Another one that I had to return because it couldn't cover the distance from gate to house (100' or so).Otherwise, it seemed to work fine - But only for short distances (25' or so).JC"
1," little contrived, but good read: i really like James D Doss, and Dead Soul is no exception. yes, the premise is a little contrived: from a red-headed girl who needs to talk to Charlie Moon, a Senator who has a problem that only Charlie can solve, investigating the murder of a tribal member, a motorcycle gang out to do Charlie in, and a possible new love. it all sounds ridiculous written here, but it works. it's not Shakespeare, but it's not supposed to be. try it; you'll like it."
1," Thank you Sony: After years of hoping for a full release of all of The Three Stooges shorts...Sony is making that wish come true. The complete shorts from 1934 though the late 1950's.Let hope they release ""Have Rocket Will Travel"" on DVD also.Thank you Sony."
1, excellent listening: Fergie outdid herself on this cd. Her vocals are great. My daughter and I love the cd. She is a dynamic performer and I recommend this cd to all.
0," Oh God, it was terrible!!!: This was terrible! Horrible!!!! With Phylis Diller as a killer, with the name Poopinplatz! I mean, there was no thrill to this! The cover looked semi-interesting, but then I saw this and nearly cried, it was so terrible! And one character was this woman who was brought in as a supposed DOA. And then she was alive! I mean, how is this a credible movie?!! When I say horrible, I mean horrible. I swear to you all now, don't dare pick this up if you see it at the movie store. You will be in for a pile of trash."
1," Just what I was looking for: This is a very good product as long as you don't need it for heavy duty applications. It is very sturdy and stable. I am using it for constructing radio control airplanes, and the type of sanding I sometimes do could not be done without it! I am very pleased with it. As far as the deisgn, there was some confusion as to the installtion of the bolt that holds the main shaft in place. There was no hole or indentation in the shaft that made it obvious how the bolt goes in. It appears the bolt just tightens against any spot on the shaft, which then seems like it would loosen over time. But, overall it it is great product and just what I was looking for. Now I am thinking of buying the Dremel vice grip!"
1," Revenge, redemption and the human heart: This is Harry Bosch at his best. Relentless and methodical, he will not stop. Along the way he finds frustration, good and bad luck, heartbreak and even a little humor in his melancholy pursuit. This time is a bit more satisfying because everybody gets what they deserve. Even Harry finds some light on the very last page. I've said this before but every one of Connelly's books deserves to be a movie and Lost Light should be at the very top of the list."
1," Tamilee Webb's Total Stretch for Beginners: Overall, the DVD is good for learning the basics. I gave this production 4 stars because I found the routine short (barely 30 min.) and not too challenging."
1," works great!: Even though they are not the latest maps, they are great for the price! I plugged it in and was ready to go. Had some issues with the order where the first shipment never made it but the seller was more than helpful and promptly shipped out another card."
1," Extremely Hard: The title says it all!It's all about the hard core mayhem in the crashing,bashing,and destoying other enemy robots.Though this game is so much fun it is HARD.When i say that word i mean HARD!O yeah,you'll get past the first 5 or 6 missions then,bam it's tough.So i only recodmend this to good gamers.Have fun playing your video games!"
0," Piece of crap, stay away: When I bought from Amazon I saw bad reviews, I needed a cheap dvd player so I bought it anyway, big mistake.... I turned it on but never got the dvd tray to open, it just makes noises, but doesn't open... if you buy this you'll regret it... belive me"
1, almost perfect: if this stroller came with a cup holder I would have given it 5 stars... I dont want to buy extra pieces - it should come with it!
1, Read this if you have ever overpacked: This is a comprehensive book for the traveler. I read it every time I am about to take another trip just to make sure I don't overpack or forget something. BUY THIS BOOK FOR EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW THAT TRAVELS. Makes a great gift.
1, tigi bed head absorbed: Was addicted from the first use. It made my hair shiny and voluminess again which it had lacked for a while but self absorbed gave it the nutrients that it had been lacking. I also must say I feel in love with the smell it is very clean and it also reminds me of orangsicles at the same time. So all in all I say it is a must have if you notice your hair becoming dull and limp and yes it may be a little expensive but everyone should indulge themselves on occassion with being self absorbed.
0," (oh-so-slightly) Endearing and (pseudo-exploitative ) Cute: 2 1/2These once ""in the hip"" Japanese female goofy rockers have not aged so well, as I am sure they did not even sound all that well when they first emerged and became all the rage for a brief time. Perhaps the sad lack of cultural connection to different music forced ""open minded"" music listeners to dig this, but the overtly exploitive and gimmicky nature of these tunes, not to mention their dumbrock songwriting style, would have any hardened musical cynic laugh at the mere premise. Still, some of these foolish little odes to the little things in life carry enough kinetic weight and vocal intuition to remain slightly endearing, switching from it's extreme light-heartedness into (rarely accomplished but often attempted) unabashed child stomping glee"
1," Great natural product: No purfume, no bleach, just good old-fashioned soap. Even reduces or eliminates the need for fabric softener. Ideal for sensitive skin and noses. Less expensive per load than most major brands."
0," Surprised Amazon carries this piece of junk!: If there was a minus-star rating, this would get it! It doesn't heat evenly (if you are lucky enough to get it to heat at all), is NOT non-stick, and won't clean at all! The first time I used it I could not get it clean without scraping off the so-called non-stick surface, which wasn't non-stick. The second time it quit heating in the middle of making pancakes. I jiggled the plug and it finally heated (unevenly) again. The third time I tried to use it even jiggling the plug couldn't get it to heat. It now resides in my trash can! I can't tell you just how bad this piece of junk is, but my opinion is that Black & Decker should just fold up shop and slink off into the night."
1, Father and sons hobby dreams do come true Gary Joe story: It is a very touching story and also sad and happy feeling ...Love story .....
1," Uplifting and upbeat!: Life is hard. One of your sons died in a drowning accident. You lose your job of 35 years. You are estranged from your other son. Your relationship with your wife is one that has her worried about telling you she is looking for a job.What's next in life? Perhaps a shot at swimming the ENGLISH CHANNEL!This uplifting and upbeat film from Britain deals with loss and tragedy, life changes, honesty, perseverance, love, and friendship. The actors are perfectly matched as each faces his or her own demons.A great film to see with friends!"
1," Ignore that other person: This book is great, the series is the best I've ever read anywhwere. The plot is totally unique and I couldn't put any of the books down easily. The other person who review this book didn't read the first 3 books...so they can't even judge this book accurately. Read it!"
1," not a bad movie with really good 3d: This movie won't win a oscar but it was entertaining. The 3d is very good, they have plenty of 3d pop out effects,and they also make use of the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, which makes for a cool effect."
0," Buck up Lil' Buckarette, and get another career!: Should we be shocked, shocked to find that those who inhabit the highest socioeconomic levels are not all sweetness and light? Hello! They didn't get where thay are through altruism. The first few chapters were entertaining but by the fifth chapter I quickly tired of all the simpering, whining, and poor-me-poor-little-kid-aren't-they-horrid? I expected more, and expected it on the next page, but I didn't even get earmuffs. The protagonist should have told them to have a Coke and a Smile, quit and called the department of social services and the labor board on her way out."
1," Terrific Reference Book: Great book on older film flops. I am amazed at the number of duds that Liz Taylor appeared in, not including her own wing in the hall. If you are a film buff or wish to learn more about movie history, then this book is highly recommended."
0," Junk!!!! Bad finishes, not like picture.: So disappointed! I got this table for a side table in my little girls room. The first one arrived broken and discolored. I know it's suppose to look aged and shabby chic, however it just looked junky! It's easy to put together, but it looks like the bottom legs were manufactured in a different place than the middle legs. Finishes did NOT match. The appliqué on the side is cute, but the finish did not match the rst of the table. It looks yellowish and broken off easily when i was putting the table together.I contacted the company to ask to return the table and get a refund. They refused the refund and sent me another junky table. now I have 2 cheap looking tables....not happy with this purchase."
0, A waste of money.: A total waste of money. After I purchased this I realized I had a better program available on my computer.
1," Fabulous: This has to be the best Jimmy Smith recording ever made. I bought this recording on LP when it was first released and was ecstatic when it was rereleased on CD. Together with George Benson, this recording highlights both players' unique stylings and talents. One of my favorite cuts next to the title track is Jimmy's rendition of Herb Alpert's ""This Guy's In Love With You."" Soft and sultry, this instrumental version lets you fully appreciate Alpert's composition without the cheesy vocal track of the original version. Smith's exceptional technique on the Hammond B3 come to life on all tracks, and Benson's guitar work is unmatched. This is a MUST HAVE if you enjoy either of these phenomenal artists."
1," Goodbye Starbucks: Yay--perfect lattes with this little baby and the Bodum milk frother! At $50 for both, it pays for itself in three weeks. The taste and consistency are absolutley perfect. And compact--both fit in a slim drawer together."
1, Excellent toy for parents and children: Our son received this as a gift for his 2nd birthday & loves it. It's great to take in the car for long trips and play on the refrigerator. Our older son loves it too because he can say the letters with Tad. We play a game & he tries to guess the letter before he has the Fridge Phonics tell him. A must have for all kids & the noise level is tolerable (loud and soft options!)
0," too rigid: I was given this as a gift and thus started to read it. After about 30 pages I found myself flinching as I remembered my experiences in traditional ""Christian"" churches...wondering if there is then no hope for the eternal life for those of other beliefs. The thinking is too narrow for my needs and the book goes back to the store."
1," Bryson City Tales: This is an excellent easy read, hard to put down, stories from a recent medical collge graduate as he expeirence life in a small NC town. From the interview process, to his first birth, to the first bith in a hospital, to being the team doctor for the local high school team. Dr. Larimore brings up all the interesting stories as he learns how to be a doctor in a small town. If you pick it up you will have a very hard time putting Bryson City Tales: Stories of a Doctor's First Year of Practice in the Smoky Mountains down. One moment you will be laughing so hard your side will hurt as you here about birthing a cow..to tears in your eyes as Dr Larimore helps a young couple with the death of their first child that he had just delivered. If you enjoyed the All Creatures Great and Small series..you will love this!!"
1," This book has everything: You will probably never need another book to learn about even the most intricate thoughts and concepts of Mahayana Buddhism. Yes, you may use other books to digg further in particular areas, but you will always come back to this one.The basis for any Buddhist studies.I have read many other books from other authors (including the famous ones), but none live up to the purity of this author. His teachings are uniquely pure with no self-interest."
1," avril lavigne: I think that Avril Lavigne's ""Let Go"" is an awesome CD. I didn't know if it would be a good CD when I bought it or if ""Complicated"" would be the only good song. But all of the songs are awesome. I like her music because she has a lot of different kinds of different songs on it for all the different moods that people have. This is one of the main reasons I love her CD so much. Another reason I love it is because not only are her songs great, but she wrote them all, too. I think that is really cool that a young artist can be so talented at singing and also be able to write her own music."
1," informative,excellant book: I purchased this book for my online religion class. Metzger's book is very informative for all of my class needs."
0," What a disappointment!: I read the three previous novels of this author and loved them. Impossible to believe the same author wrote this one.I suspect Robert Ludlum ghosted it. Convoluted. A significant portion of the story takes place in the protagonist's mind.Little action. Little suspense. Morality big here - like Grisham, the author decided it was time for to write about the homeless. You can pass this one!"
1, Too Good: I just bought this CD single at Wal-Mart yesterday and found myself immediately addicted. I had to wrest myself away from my headphones just this morning. That's how good the CD is. I can't wait for Kelly's debut CD to come out.
1," a short story master: Bobbie Ann Mason is one of the modern masters of the short story, and to see why all you have to do is pick up this collection. The stories all have a melancholy feel and are simple stories of rural Kentucky. They do at times tend to be very similar, so it is best to break this collection up with something else. But reading this shows you the skill Mason has with the short story, and why so many students love her work. I especially loved the touching story ""Drawing Names."""
0," SVU Books Have Sunk Pretty Low...: I loved the SVH books, as well as most of the SVU books. But since the SVU characters have been in sophomore year, the plots have deteriorated and the new characters, with the exception of Neil, are awful & shallow. Sam's Secret Love Diary is the worst yet, not so much the writing as that the main character is a slacker/moron. Right away, it's guaranteed that the book is going to be terrible, even just for the reason that the narrator is a guy who's only interest in life seems to be getting another can of beer... Plus the plot is extremely weak, about Sam's new career as a filmmaker with Lila Fowler in his documentary. All this was inspired by a documentary about his favorite bar."
0," not ergonomic: I bought this after using the 12-inch wedge, which is uncomfortable to sleep on. Both the 7-inch and 12-inch do work for acid reflux, though the 7-inch doesn't work as well because you will tend to slide, making the elevation insuffient. In addition, they are not ergonomically designed. The main problem is the lack of lumbar support. The human spine is not perfectly straight. You need to put a rolled towel under your lower back to feel comfortable, otherwise you'll find yourself sliding down toward the bottom of the wedge in the morning. Prepare to get lower backaches. Also, this is not designed for side sleepers. I'm going to try stacking something under the head of the bed instead."
0, Not fantastic for spices: I am not a coffee drinker and bought this for spices but the device does not grind fine enough. Also starts to smell of burnt lubricant after a few seconds' use. Perhaps it's a defective device.
1, Yes Large...: These are not only large but extra large....just make sure that is what your looking for. Arrived very quickly and promptly!
1," Incredible: Basically just another amazing album from Sigur Ros. I can understand how some people dislike the music because it really does take a little patience to get into. The songs are slow and long, so if your in a hurry you might as well pass on this music. With that said, there's some incredibly beautiful music to be heard on this disc and I wouldn't recommend passing it up. Highlights are ""Svefn g englar"", ""Staralfur"", ""Flugufrelsarinn"", ""Vidrar vel til loftarasa"" & ""Olsen olsen"""
0, Don't buy it.: Without this antenna the radio in my jeep only picked up one station. With this antenna it only picked up one station.
0," Unhelpful: I recieved this book as a gift and thought the title sounded interesting. I am a professor and have to deal with students as well as other faculty. I did not find anything helpful in the entire book. Most of the advice was along the lines of ""can't we just get along."" There was little info on how to actually accomplish that."
1," better than most: Being a fan of Dave Grohl,Foo fighters and Nirvana I have read every book published on the subjects and nothing new is ever revealed .Most of the material can already be found in magazines already published however Nothing Left To Lose did reveal things about Dave Grohl that had not been revealed before as far as I am aware.The book was very interesting and well written."
0," Not great and not worth $20: I bought 4 of these (buy 3 get 1 free) when they were only $15 each - a couple of weeks ago. They just arrived and I am disappointed. Yes, they are heavy, but heavy as in a bath mat. The loops are too short and compact - making for a pretty hard nap. They aren't soft. They are smaller than all of the towels I currently own. I got the silver sage color, which on 2 lap tops and 3 PC monitors looked like it had a blue-ish hue to it - no they are just green, not blue at all and not a particularly nice green. The worst part, though, and the reason I'm sending them back is that the sewing is terrible. The finishing on the sides is way off. At $20, they should not be factory rejects.Update after a washing: color fades, too. Wow, they really suck."
1, ferret litter pan: Marshall Lock-On Ferret Litter Pan(Color May Vary)Much better than the corner type pan. The back and sides are high enough to prevent a ferret from pooping outside the box. Locks on to the cage to prevent movement. Recommended for anyone who has a problem training a ferret to use a litter box.
0," Sacrilegious Cards: If you want cards which will insult all Christians, this is the pack to get. Dogs in Santa attire are fine, but dogs portraying the Holy Family are beyond insult. Moreover, dogs representing Jesus, Mary, & Joseph, have zero esthetic value, aside from the blasphemy shown. Has Amazon no shame in selling such gross parody of what Christians consider sacred? Ellen"
0, Doesn't work!: This product worked only for about 6 months for me!!I dont even know why it stopped working?? I hardly used it...I wont recommend it..
1, THE BEST!!!!!!: We can't say enough about how great this seat is! It is so easy to use and it didn't take very long to install. Getting in and out is a breeze. Adjusting the straps are a breeze. This seat is the best on the market in my opinion. I only wish that it could be used as a booster seat later on!
1, Works well: I really like the Senco DS200-AC Duraspin using these bits. They work well and last a long time. I would purchase both agan.
0," Won't filet fish: I purchased 2 of these knives, B&D EK700, 9 inch, for the explicit purpose of fileting panfish, e.g. crappie, small bass, small catfish. When I used them for the first time (20Aug) it was obvious that they were intended for bread, tomatoes, and nothing more. The reciprocating blades separated and raw flesh moved between them as they sliced. This caused them to move away from the intended cut line. I would recommend that all potential buyers for this purpose look elsewhere."
1, superb illustrations: i do think that this book was well thought out andcleverly written and i am amazed that this mans talent hasnot been recognised further
1, Great book: So many twists and turns had you guessing right to the end. Well worth reading. Can`t wait to read book two.
0, disc 2 defective: Disc 2 defective - there are 2 copies of the parade of the athletes and no main program.
0," WHAT IS THIS MESS??????: Ever since the dreaded ""Badu Live"" CD, Erykah Badu has drifted into mainstream, commercialistic garbage, releasing songs that sound nothing like, or similar to those on her ground-breaking debut, ""Baduizm."" She further drifts into R&B oblivion with her latest release of ""Worldwide Underground."" After what I sampled from a friend, refusing to buy it after hearing the monotonous ""Mama's Gun,"" I was very disappointed! Even my friend can't get with this one, and he's as big a Badu fan as I am, or was. ""Danger"" and ""Bump It"", the only ear-catching songs here can't even save this CD from musical ennui. Erykah repeats hooks way too many times, songs linger on forever and the beats are so lifeless they need a defibrillator to revive them. EB dropped the ball on this one, and if she doesn't hurry and return to the down-home soulful, funk flava that permeated ""Baduizm"", I'm gonna have to stop listening to her...BUT, uhhm, I'm kinda doin that now. Better luck next time, Erykah!"
1," This is that Critical First Step: For the non-jazz pianist who looks at a ""fake book"" of jazz tunes and doesn't know where to begin-Assuming that you have a good ear, have a basic piano technique and can read music half-decently, this book can be very useful. Once you play through the written portions and try your hand at the suggested variations for the 8 provided original tunes, you are likely to have enough skill to play many of the tunes you might encounter in a ""fake book"" in a manner that sounds fairly convincing. From that point on, you can apply what you've learned with John Valerio's book to other tunes and expand from there.I highly recommend this book as that critical first step in that it provides you with stylistic ""rules"" that keep your efforts sounding ""authentic"" until you have enough knowledge and experience to branch out using others' ideas and those of your own."
1," GO BUY PUPPETS. YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME!: I am a young fan of Metallica, I am only 15 years old. However, after buying all of Metallica's albums, I come back again and again to listen to Puppets. It seems to be a complete story of the corruption of power that any political person will want to listen to it, be a fan of metal or not. Enjoyers of the new Metallica sound can learn a lot by listening to Puppets. Back in the day, when they still slashed on the guitars, this album was made. It was at this album that the band hit its peak. The precision in it is astounding. It was at this album that they perfected Heavy Metal. I wish there were 6 stars on this scale; I would give this album such."
1, Andy Russell: Bought this as a gift for a friend's husband. Thought it was by another author of the same name. Oops!!! But gave it to their grandchild. She loved it.
0," Interlinear Old Testament seems error prone: Excited about such a presentation as this interlinear text, I quickly looked up a couple of verses. Since Genesis is available for review, I decided to look there. Genesis 4:1 looked okay. okay now Genesis 3:15 - oops. H7779 (bruise) was incorrectly labeled as H2233 (seed/semen).I'm interested in using a book like this to explore and understand the meaning of the underlying text, but if errors are introduced by the author of this book on the scale that it seems to be based on the sample data, this makes the book, which initially comes across as an authority on the bible, instead be an obstacle to correct learning.How can anyone recommend a reference tool prone to error?"
0," Perry, Innocent-Paramount, GUILTY as charged.: As everyone else here has already noted, the release schedule on this, the most sophisticated of all 1950's television, has been slow and torturous. Most viewers who enjoyed this originally will be dead by the time they finish releasing this. If they finish releasing it.Look at the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart Shows, both widely accepted as two of the best comedies ever on commercial TV, both stalled from further releases at the fourth season mark.Of course the other side of boycotting, as has been suggested in more than a few reviews here, might just make it easier for Paramount to stop releasing them at all if no one's buying.There are certainly more important things in life to worry about, but it's a shame to see something of such high quality being so poorly handled."
0," Buy this if you want purple hair!: I purchased this trying to make my blonde highlights a little brighter. Well after one use it turned them purple!!!! I couldn't believe it! The purple washed out after a few washes with another shampoo I use, but I will NEVER use this again."
1," As the title says : It is just a guide !: It gives you a whole vision of DB2 V7 for OS/390 and Z/OS but it doesn't go into details (Of course none books can do it ) Use it at a reference book , and when needing more details take the IBM manuals (Just to add that text of this book often come from the IBM manuals parts) !If you passed the 69 tests questions provided in the book for 516 the exam, you can then enroll for the test , because it is quite the same level. The sample tests give you the idea of the questions."
1," ""Stranger"" encourages reading between the lines: Some of the things in this book are a little outdated...if not somewhat questionable in a realistic sense (as is communism which looks good on paper but has no practical application) but this does not detract from the brilliance of Heinlein. ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" is a wonderfully told story about love and the beauty/tragedy of humanity. Heinlein's use of archetypes makes this book easy to relate to and, ultimately, a timeless treasure. I had read this book in highschool and it is still one of my favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the sci-fi genre but craves a more ""philosophical"" plot."
1, Awesome: I'm a huge Supernatural fan so I loved preordering season 3 and having it shipped to me so promptly! So far season 4 is ROCKIN!
0," ""Lifeforce"" is garbage: This is one of the silliest movies I've ever seen in my life. Don't waste your time."
1," Most Informative Book I've Read On The Subject... So Far: I've read a few books on OBEs, including Mr. Buhlman's first book, Adventures Beyond the Body. I bought both of his books at the same time and I read them in order. This one is better, much more informative. If you could purchase only one book on OBEs it should be The Secret of the Soul. He answers more questions than you'd expect and does so in a rational and experienced way. He also provides a number of techniques and testimonials. I have not personally experienced an OBE, so I can't verify the accuracy of the information, but it seems compelling and worth investigating.I was somewhat prepared for the information in this book, because I've heard Mr. Buhlman speak about OBEs on the radio and Youtube. If you're new to OBEs and open to a non-traditional explanation of the universe, our souls and the meaning of our time here on Earth, this is a great place to start."
1," Works as Advertised: I was sad when I realized my Xbox couldn't play DVDs without this, but as soon as I got it and installed it I was happy. Works great, has worked great for years."
0," Doesn't Even Work!!: Huge box, unpack, assemble, plug in,NOTHING! It doesn't even turn ON!Now I have to pack, haul, and ship back.I hate when this happens. A lot of hasslefor nothing. I am going to go and buy locally.I ordered 2 extra bulbs. Now I have to mail them back tooto a different address.Skip this product!"
0," Horrible DVD quality: You can read the other reviews here to get an idea of the movie, but I have to warn people that the DVD transfer is very poorly done. The video is faded and looks cheaply produced even on a standard TV. The video is non-anamorphic (it's incredible that a NEW movie like this could be encoded this way) so it looks even worse on an HDTV because you'll have to ""zoom"" in on the picture to get rid of the black bars. The subtitles are burned-in to the video so there's no option to switch languages or turn them off. Finally, the audio is stereo (2 channels) instead of 5.1. It's incredible that such a fantastic, recent movie could get such horrible treatment on DVD. Empire Pictures needs to get with the program."
1, The best on the subject !: Being relativelly new to the subject of Japanese swords and fittings I was quite impresse by two things:- Quality of the pictures- Description of the itemsI think this is worht having for anyone that trully appreciates the japanese swordmanship and art itself.
0," Stolen Ideas: This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first novel, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself. Jordan is a thief."
0," ""Grim"" is right...: As an adult, die-hard fan of the Lemony Snicket series, I'm having a reeeaaaallly hard time even getting halfway through Book the Eleventh. After last year's stunning ""Slippery Slope,"" Daniel Handler seems to be treading water here, dragging things out so that he can make it to Book the Thirteenth, as is planned. But there's nothing in this ""Grotto"" worth much of anyone's time. No new interesting characters (some annoying ones, however); and Olaf and Esme's delicious devilry is put to little use. I'll slog through to the end somehow, but it ain't gonna be easy."

0," If This Scares You, Then You're The Clown: WOW! I have always been a little frightened of clowns myself, which is why I wanted to see this movie. Mercifully, I'm not afraid of wretched acting or I would have had a massive coronary. Simply put, this movie makes little to no sense and if you want gore, go to a store and squeeze some ketchup on a mannequin(since that's what the effects people did)."
0," HA - HA COMEDY: VIN DIEANSAL IS A REALLY GOOD ACTOR; BUT IN THIS ONE IT'S REALLY WEAK.IT'S ACTULLY VERY FUNNY WHEN YOU SEE THE PREVIEWS THE FIRST TIME EVER.THE PACIFAIR ISN'T THE BEST COMEDY EVER.I'M JUST GOING TO WACTH IT IN SATURDAY AND RIGHT ANOTHER REVIEW LATER(SIRLSEY,I CAN'T BELIVE POEPLE ARE REVIWING WHEN IT'S NOT EVENT OUT;NOT COUNTING AS ME.)"
0," Big waste of money: This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased. Luckily I got it on sale so I was only out $20 but even at that I was angry by the poor quality of it. The hair is impossible to get a comb thru. It was just a big ball of fuzz in the back when we took it out of the box and it still is. There was no way we could make it look good. The ""make up"" and ""nail polish"" changing colors did not work nearly as well as it should have. Just a piece of junk."
1," My students love it!: Personally, I think this movie could have a little more details to it, but my 6-8th grade Religion students really liked it. We got about halfway through the VHS version but the tape kept jamming and I couldn't ever get is past the halfway point. They kept begging me to let them finish watching it! The used DVD prices were pretty good so I ordered a copy and they were thrilled to be able to finish watching the movie. Christian Bale was a hit with the girls. One even commented, ""I know it's wrong, but Jesus is hot!"""
1," Harry Potter Complete Collection: Not being a Harry Potter fan, this was a semi difficult purchase. The price was fantastic and after watching them all, while Im not going to go buy a cape and magic wand. It was entertaining."
1," Fills a huge void: Most histories of the Gettysburg campaign effectively end on July 3, 1863. At most, a few sentences are added at the end indicating that Lee made his way back to Virginia. Even the sophisticated reader has had little opportunity to learn just what happened after the battle. This book changes all that. In great detail, almost every moment of the retreat to Virginia is described. The author makes great but appropriate reliance on primary sources to provide not just the only but the definitive study of these critical few weeks of the war. The book is generally well written, sometimes vivid. However, the author does spend more time than is necessary listing every pound of corn, every mule, every wagon foraged by Lee's army. This makes several pages of the book a numbing read and this data would have been better left to the appendix. This is, however, a small problem in an otherwise outstanding book. A must read for any serious student of the Civil War."
0," Brown and Boring...: I was totally bored by ""Antz."" The story was an insult to the audience as it straddled between it's lame attempts to be an""adult"" film (whatever THAT is! How about just making a GOOD MOVIE!) and it's fear of losing the family audience. The animation lacked any individuality, and the design was repulsive. Trying not to be Disney should not preclude good taste! And it's striking to note that Speilberg has said that even his own kids liked ""A Bug's Life"" better!!"
1," Nice graduation gift for a reasonable price: Since I have so many graduation gifts to buy, I was so pleased to find this bracelet. It has a message in just 3 words. It was inexpensive and filled the bill for all the girls on my graduation list."
1," Worth the price: This 1998 Roxy Music collection is named ""The Greatest"", one of a series of limited editions of artists from the EMI catalog in Japan (though Roxy was signed to the Warner family of labels). This is probably the most complete collections of Roxy out there on a single disc that covers the best of all the studio recording from the beginning of Virginia Plain all the way through Avalon's three singles including Take A Chance With Me. For me, one of the best inclusions was the dramatic For Your Pleasure, all 6+ distorted and experimental minutes of it. My only gripes is that they went with the disco version of Angel Eyes instead of the more rocking version on the original Manifesto release, and because of it's limited release that the price is really steep. If stranded on a desert island and you had to take one Roxy album, I'd go with this one."
1," I like my ramps: ""I like my ramps"" I just bought a four seater UTV (1250 lbs) and knew I wanted to replace the ramps (wooden) I owned at the time. Went to Amazon (of course), did my research home work. Bought these, my wife and I assembled them and loaded the UTV for a few trial runs, flawless, they are great. Off to the trails we go. Do not worry about loading or unloading, safe as can be. My wife (not very big at that) can manage the ramps like a breeze."
1," PortaMax Jr, turns portable tabel saw into contractor's saw: Adding the PortaMax Jr to your 8-1/4"" or 10"" Bench-top table saw gives you an accurate saw with a precise rip fence, equal to many higher priced Table Saws. Allow ripping a full 4X8 sheet of plywood lengthwise. This accesory is easy to install and Rousseau provides prompt replies to any questions that arise during installation.Table fits Delta, Makita and most other portable contractor's saws and allows you to make precise cuts using the strong, secure fence. I have used this accessory with my Delta 8-1/4"" saw for cabinet making, and general woodworking.The table is strong and is easily adjusted to remain level with the saw table. I am very satisfied and now I have a versatile table saw tha is nearly as accurate as rigs costing more than the saw and PortaMax combined."
0," Again, not up to par: After the disappointment I felt with Ms. Wright's first book, Blush, I thought the second book would surely be an improvement. Sad to say, the same mistakes made in the first were made in the second. Rehashed dialogue and repeats of same scenes were in this too. It is as if it wasn't properly edited. Hearing Jenna, the lead characted moan and cry throughout the whole book about how she wasn't good enough got real old. Again, a missed opportunity to tell what could have been a great story about the hustle and bustle of the black elite of Washington, DC. I think this author should give up writing romantic fiction or take a few more writing classes."
0," Dinosaurs? Where?: What on earth is this? Sequels should only be attempted if the makers of the original have something new to say. It starts off promisingly, with a ruthless organisation threatening the well-being of the lost world, but in no time everybody's stranded and we're left with something that's just a dull, plodding copy of the previous film. And where are the dinosaurs? There are hardly any, and the ones which do appear are so fake-looking and ridiculous you wonder if Frank Searle had a hand in their construction. Utter trash. Why they bothered to make this overblown bore is a mystery. Why anyone should want to sit through it more than once (if even that) is even more of an enigma."
1," Great value for the price: Other reviews have said that this was flimsy and not like the photo, however for the price it is great. Yes it is not stiff and will shift out of place, but so long as you make sure it is in place when you place your child in its seat, you're golden. I am sure this will be invaluable in the future for the new car seat we've bought. Learned my lesson having to wash and re-wash and re-wash the last one with diaper accidents."
1," The Latin Psalter: a work to be completed: For those desiring to read the Psalter in the Vulgate of the early church, this book is invaluable. The selected psalms are accompanied by extensive notes, explaining the Latin in terms of the Hebrew from which they were translated. For example, one aspect of Hebrew verb forms(completed vs. uncompleted actions) explains how the Latin translation can be either present or past tense. There is also a brief introduction describing the early history of the Latin Psalter text. The major disappointment of this book is its size; one wishes the author had annotated the entire Psalter, not just a few dozen psalms. In his introduction, LaDoceur alludes to just such a future project, but apparently it is yet to be realized."
1," What a blessing!: I also believe there are no accidents. I can't remember where I first heard about ""Writing Down the Bones,"" but the recommendation was so intriguing that I had to order the tapes. Now I drive along in my car listening to Natalie Goldberg describe all the things we have in common, and her words validate me as a writer. Because of ""Writing Down the Bones,"" I acknowledge writing as my ""practice"" and have stopped scattering my energies. Thank you, Natalie."
1, Great!: This was a great book it was filled with adventure and exitement! When you read this book your in suspense till the last moment! It is just a great book!
1," I love these headphones!: They are absolutely great. They are light weight, let in just enough ""street"" noise without ruining the quality of sound-at least for audio books anyway, and have only a single wire to contend with...a definite bonus in my book.They are soooooo comfy to wear, it's like they aren't even there. I love to listen to my mp3 player at night in bed, and when I wear these head phones I can't even feel them on, I just hear the book.I would certainly recommend these to anyone."
1," outstanding translation: The English translation is one of the best I've seen in manga. The translation for ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" is sadly stilted, and loses much of the class-society ambiance of the original (members of different social classes spoke differently in feudal Japan). However, in ""Blade of the Immortal"" (original title: ""Mugen no juunin"", or ""Inhabitant of Infinity"") the translation team has done an outstanding job. Hurrah for Dark Horse! (Maybe a revised translation for ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" may be possible?)[I'm certain my comments will be buried among others that explain the storyline. But here goes anyway.]"
1," Thought-provoking, fascinating book for anyone!: Recommended by a co-worker, I shied away from it at first because of the religious topic. I COULD NOT put it down, and am on the 4th book of the series. This book will change your outlook on your personal life, your beliefs, beliefs of your loved ones, and will create an acute awareness of how our present world may be headed this way. It may startle you, but it is an intriguing book, ""moving fiction"" is how it's catagorized, and it is. Read the first book, Left Behind, and you won't be able to wait to read the following books...It's for everyone...it's a fabulous story, based on happenings as related in the Bible. Learn how not to be ""Left Behind""."
1," Extremely sexy...: After I visited France, I got more into French music. I picked up Hélène Ségara's CD without knowing anything about her, but this one becomes one of my favorite CD. I have to say I was lucky that day!Hélène has a very sexy voice, but I don't have an elegant way to describe it. Most sounds in this CD are beautiful. This CD is also a good testing CD for your system, the bass is very rich and just right for me... Very high quality CD."
1, A Pentecostal Classic: For years this book was the textbook on Pentecostal Pneumatology. It is a clear and concise study of who the Holy Spirit is and what He does. It was written in a way that allowed both laymen and serious students to understand the subject well. I believe it still holds up today. It could be used for a Sunday School elective or Wed. night Bible study even now. Every Pentecostal should own this book as well as those who want to understand what Pentecostals believe.
1," Very Solid: My four year old has destroyed three different beds within weeks of getting them... This one is STILL STANDING and extremely well too. After reading the review about this bed surviving a hurricane I figured that if it could survive a hurricane it could possibly survive ""The Deconstructor"". Also IN THE PAST my son has refused to sleep in a bed since moving out of his crib but he actually is still so excited about his car bed that he has slept in it every night. The only thing he was upset about was it didn't have eyes and a mouth like ""Lightning"" but I explained to him that only cartoon cars have those features and real cars are more like his bed, he accepted it. :)"
1," discs works good and no problems: Great price and great discs, I've not had any costers with these discs and they are durable at even high write speeds. I will continue to buy these discs in the future."
1," For little boys or big boys!: I gave this ant farm to my husband for part of his Christmas. It also included a 52"" Panasonic flat screen TV. Christmas afternoon, the TV sat in the box, but the ant farm was up and running with him sitting in front of it with a magnifying glass!!I had ordered the ants ahead of time because this is not our first ""ant rodeo,"" so if you're thinking about ordering one, order your ants so they'll arrive about the same time! Then you're ready to go.This is a big ant farm and plenty big for anyone. Realize that the ants will only live for a couple of months, max, without a queen. You don't want a queen, though, because they lay hundreds of eggs a day and the farm would burst at the seams. Plus, they won't mail queens, so get over it. Just enjoy your ants and order some more when they finally poop out. They will work 24/7 and you'll enjoy their quirky tunneling decisions.I'd like to have a gel farm but I can only find tiny ones.Enjoy!!!"
1," ""Wicked Tribe, Rooling Tribe!"": Otherland is one of those books you fall head over heels in love with, and then go about to all your friends exclaiming that this time you've done it, you've truly done it, and have found the best fantasy book out there that you've been waiting for all these years so-go-read-it-now!... And then they ask you to explain what it's about and you're at a loss for words.""It's, um, about a virtual reality world... No wait, no, that's not describing it at all. It /is/ virtual reality, but it's not some silly SF book like you're thinking... Where's it take place? In Africa. Um. In the Otherland system. Err-- in Australia. Wait. Oh, just go read the bloody thing!""There is a lot to this book. You've got bushmen, evil aboriginals, net friends, a mesterious AI, a quest for immortality... It goes on. There's no concise explanation I can give. Yes, it's a massive tome, and there are four more just as big, but you'll just wish you could spend more time in this world by the end."
0," Cheap chinese piece of junk: This gauge got stuck at 550 (just above the red) shortly after I got it. Tank went empty, got it refilled, and the gauge won't budge. I'm certain it's got more in it than that. Should be reading closer to 1800 right after a refill. Tapped on it with a wrench, but it would not un-stick.Figures... it's made in China."
0," Disapointed: I felt so very sad when i saw this movie. I loved the books, and the movie ruined the whole spirit of the book, the spesial relationship between Eragon and Saphira, and that was totaly wrong in the movie. He said to her "" I am the dragonrider and you are the dragon, and we do what I tell you"" like she is his slave. 3 part stupid, 1 part lucky, is 4 part annoying and booring, and it seemed to me like he was more 4 part stupid. He was way to lucky, i keept hoping he would die, so he at least had to suffer the consiquenses of his actoins, but noo, he keept living and learnd nothing. That movie was a shame, because the books are so much better. There he has to suffer the consiquenses of his bad choises."
1," Outstanding product and price: I could not be more satisfied with the quality and value of these sheets. You will see quite a bit of lent in the dryer filter during the first washing, but that's to be expected. No piling occurred. Super comfortable and warm. We lowered our thermostat at night to accommodate. The queen size sheets fit our bed perfectly. I have never posted a review on a product but I was so pleased with this purchase that I felt compelled to share in hopes of saving others a lot of money. No need to purchase Lands End or Eddie Bauer flannel sheets which cost two to three times as much."
0," Very disappointing DVD of a great film.: I truly like this film. It is funny all the way through, and James Belushi is the perfect foil for uptight yuppie Charles Grodin. However, I am sorry I bought the DVD. First of all, it's not in widescreen. Second, it has zero features. No trailer, no production notes, no cast notes. Nothing. There is of course better picture quality than the VHS edition, but there is not one other thing to recommend it. It would be different if this was a budget title, but it's a $20 DVD!... Buy this only if you can't find a VHS copy."
1, A great book and a must read: This was the most insightful book I have ever read about the New Age movement. It is written honestly by a man who dove in head first searching for answers to life's deepest questions. This book allows you to follow the author on a quest for truth and gives the reader rare insight into what the New Age movement is all about and what lies behind it.
0," Zero Points are too many: Without question, this is the most obscenely overpriced and worthless book I've ever bought."
0," picture book, only!: my son is a huge byron barton fan; we read _machines at work_, _planes_, and _trucks_ several times a day. i was VERY disappointed to see that _tools_ is merely pictures with the name of the tool below/beside/above it. tools included: clippers, rake, electric drill, pliers, hammer, saw, hoe, shovel, screwdriver, monkey wrench, trowel & mallet and chisel. first of all, i wouldn't classify a rake as a tool. secondly, the pages feel flimsier than on his other board books.save yourself the trouble. this one's not worth getting."
0," FXSpringer01: Filmed by a five year old with a hand-held camera. Blair Witch Bad! Story line is not bad, but don't waste your money."
0," Antique Info: I saw the publication date, and thought it would have info useful for my son, who plays paintball. While I never expected him to use the hygeine or medical section, I was hoping for a lot more regarding movement, fields of fire, and basic tactics. Not so.What I found was a rehash of a bunch of Cold War era FM's. All the info was Euro-centric, all the equipment was out of date (I doubt we even have 90mm RCLs in any armory inventory,) there was no real discussion of movement or signalling (despite the chapter). It did not help I found the entire manual online.The only thing saving this book from one star is the fact there were useful references. However, unless you are utterly unfamiliar with the Army, I would NOT recommeend this book."
0, My shells had expired before they ever shipped: We love Annie's white cheddar at our house. That's why I bought the case. I was certainly disappointed with the chalky consistency of the product we received. Then we noticed the date stamped on the cheese powder package--it had already expired months before I even ordered it. My kids won't eat it. Very disappointing.
0," Awful: All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is just... Awful. I thought the story was kinda stupid, the characters were annoying, the voice acting wasn't all that great for the most part, and I hate how they switched the actor for the role of Charlie. There are too many songs, yes it's a kids movie and kids movies have songs but this amount is just too much, I could seriously skip every song and only watch maybe a half-hour or so of movie. The ending was stupid. I could keep going, but I'll stop. All-in-all, this movie sucks. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
0," Big flop: I saw this film when in came to TV and was so much looking forward to having it on DVD. I finally got it...or did I? When they put it on DVD, they edited and chopped so much of the full version out of it that it makes no sense at all and is only a shadow of what was a great mini-series . I watched it and was so sick from what those idiots do to it that I dropped it into the trash can, which is the only place for it. Don't buy this mess hopping for quality. Matter of fact, Don't buy it at all! Just don't."
0," Good lord, this sucks: When I rented Disney's Hide and Sneak, I wasn't expecting much. However, I did not expect it to suck this much.The first problem you will probably notice is how boring the gameplay is. There are a few puzzles that a braindead person could beat, and there are stealth parts that nobody can lose at.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics and sound is OK."
0," Poor and Inconsistent DVD Player: This was my second DVD Player with the first being a Toshiba SD-2109, which I loved but did not have the ability to play CDR's and CDRW's. After reading the technical readouts on various websites, I purchased this JVC Player for this particular ability. Additionally, the gold finish went well with my Sony WEGA. At first, the DVD player worked fine. However, after three months, this JVC started skipping on DVDs (New and Rented)and as a matter of fact, once, it completely jammed. It made a terrible sound (sort of like my DVD was being completely destroyed) and I was forced to unplug it and replug it back in. There was indeed some damage to my DVD. Now (about 8 months after purchase...I've been lazy about bringing it into a service center), it cannot go completely through one DVD without skipping. I am very disappointed with this product and am considering purchasing a new Sony or Panasonic DVD player."
1, Great Wipers: Have had these on my BMW 330 for about 3 months. They work perfectly in Oregon winter rain. Wipe windshield clean without streaking or chattering. Much better than other wipers I have on my other vehicles. Buy these!
0," Not great.: I did not think this was such a great book. Somewhat of an arrogant type of person, not at all a humbleness to her. Sorry, I didn't like it."
1," keeps getting better!: Again, another wonderful, tear-jerking, humorous, sweet book filled with true stories about motherhood. You can't go wrong with any Chicken Soup book. I hope there will be many more to come!"
0," Disappointment: Not the best guitar. Bought a Washburn Rover from Amazon that is perfect for a portable with better ease of use, sound and tuning. The name ""Martin"" on this does not necessary mean it is good."
0," Krups Kettles are getting progressively worse: This is the 3rd cordless tea kettle of the Krups brand and it will be the last one d=for us. First one was great, lasted a long time, almost 4 years, the second lasted two years. This one was much noisier than the first two, as soon as you turn it on, it was loud. The worst thing it started leaking after about 10-11 months of 1-3/day uses. Good bye to Krups."
1," Great knives.: Be sure when ordering these knives to get the ones made in Germany, a big difference over the ones made in China. The German knives do not come with the handy wooden knife holder. I wish it was sold as a single item!"
0," Not worth a penny!: I bought this product hoping to pull a dent, not to hear it pop. Every time I tried to pull on a dent it would pop off and nothing happened. It may be a good carrier for glass, but this is not a dent puller and not worth anything I spent on it."
0," This is so lulzy: This is one of the worst movies ever made, but it is one of the funniest things I have ever seen! Every thing about this piece of crap is so bad that it is so funny! If you want to turn off your brain and see one of the dumbest things ever made by mankind, this is your movie!"
0," Completely trivial: It seemed like a chore to finish this book. I cared about none of the characters or the situations they were in (the racial stereotypes were especially bothersome), and the earthquakes themselves (and the damage they created) were pretty ridiculous. Sorry folks, one earthquake will not send an entire state into the ocean. And being able to predict exactly how a building will collapse, and exactly what damage will happen where (let alone being able to predict earthquakes to that degree of accuracy) is impossible not only currently, but probably forever.Save your money!"
0," Should have read the reviews first...: Like many others, I purchased these at a local store to decorate melting wafers/melting chocolate. I had a perfectly smooth cake pop and the pens would not write at all on the surface. Looking back at the package, it does not say it will work on melting wafers. It just says, ""Perfect for cookies, cakes and more!"" And lists things like cheese and frosting as other foods to write on. If I would have read the reviews online, I would not have purchased the Wilton brand. I have since ordered Americolor pens and I am looking forward to trying those out.I didn't rate these Wilton pens at 1 star because they probably work on other foods, but they did not meet my needs at all."
0," Poor Quality Transfer to DVD Format: King Of The Zombies is a great campy/funny B&W film, and Mantan Moreland steals the show. Unfortunately this transfer of the film print to DVD is the worst that I have ever seen, and Im not referring to the scratches, dust or spots on the print that was used, this actually adds to the vintage feel of the film. The problem with this DVD is that the frame of view has been cropped in on all sides so any scene where the actors head is close to or at the edge of the original frame gets there head cut off down to the nose or mouth and this is through the whole film not one or two scenes. I don't recommend that anyone who enjoys vintage film of this type buy this DVD."
0," Be Careful, Not for small children: I just wanted to add to the choir. This movie is not for younger children. It is way to scary. The other reviews said it well. Santa almost dies twice. Santa Paws is nearly incenerated but the young orphan girl climbs onto the incenerator conveyor belt and they both nearly die. Merry Christmas. Lots of talk about my parents live in heaven now and I don't have anyone to take care of me. Youch! My child was sobbing about the possibility of losing us, who would be there for them, what if Santa dies to? Thank you Disney. The only good thing about this family movie night was that it was a rental and it didn't get put under the Christmas tree."
0, Broken after a few use.: Looks nice good price lots of accessories BUT broken after a few dvd use. Says wrong disk in every DVD....you decide...
0," Don't buy this book: I completely agree with Gary's comment below. This book is of little value except for those who have very limited knowledge of small business networking. This is to say, this book may be useful for those who are NOT in the IT consulting business.You won't get any warm and fuzzy feeling, if you are looking for valuable insights of running MS Small Business Server 2000 as the title of this book implies. In most cases, the author tip toes around the most basic concepts, congurations and setups without any appreciable new insights in very verbose albeit walm and friendly fashion.This book really should have been part of the ""Dummies"" series, as it serves inexperienced business persons or very incompetant consultant types but not technical persons with hands-on experiences in NT and 2000.Notice how so many glorious reveiws are from Washington State. My suspision is that authors' buddies have helped him out on this. This is NOT a five star book, period."
1," Keep up the good work Katinas: I bought the Katinas Destiny CD for my kids when my friend recommended it. It's great music and lyrics and my kids and I love it. Our favorites are It's real, Thank you, You Are, Sold Out believer and Who do you Love.It doesn't have lyrics that sounds borderline. It is good, fun, christian music."
1," Linksys card: It was very easy to install, works great with my system and picks up and gives off a strong signal. I had no problems with placing, and the delivery of this order everything went smooth."
1," Flirt's Satisfaction: This was just an enjoyable read which I did in one sitting. Drew thought Sydney was just ""plain"" and out of her league by reopening Flirt near his restaurant, Satisfactions, but he found out different during the snow storm.I enjoyed this story and though the author did not let us know who Merry's stalker was, I was hoping it was her ex-husband.It was good to have other Coleman members stop in as well and look forward to more relatives to read about."
0," Strange knife: This knife is weighted improperly. The blade is too heavy for the handle and it feels as if the whole knife is being pulled down, which is an unpleasant way to cut. It got dull very quickly with just routine use and I don't recommend it at all. Just another example of ""celebrity"" (I use the term loosely) branding and the lemmings who will buy anything."
1, Quality Music: My favorite is : Sumn like a PIMPPlay it in your car with a powered subAwsome/Quality Music and beats -
0, bad movie: The movie was not what I thought it would be the ending was not a good ending at all and thought it would of been a better movie
1," Great for the most part: Everything about the bottle is great except one thing: the cap. You practically need vice grips to open the cap spout so I leave it open most of the time. Otherwise, very satisfied."
0," Disappointed: We purchased this schredder a few years ago and it was working great when shredding small batches, including credit cards and cd's and dvd's.A few weeks ago we gathered a whole bunch of paper documents (not credit cards or dvd's ) to shred as we are cleaning house, and the thing stopped working early on (10 minutes or so into shredding). It will only work now for about 1-2 inches of paper, even thin newspaper thickness items, then has to stop for several hours to ?reset?. The thing is not overheating (takes 2 seconds to stop) and it does go in reverse. Occasionally now it will shred one whole sheet of paper, then it quits.We have to purchase another shredder and we still have a pile of stuff to shred.Thought it would work better than this, and the warranty is expired.I recommend giving this shredder a heavy duty workout as soon as you purchase it."
1, DOES WHAT IT SAYS: I ORIGINALY ORDERED THE WRONG SIZE MEMORY (INFORMATION GIVEN BY TECH WAS IN CORRECT) & SENT THEM BACK. THIS MEMORY IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.
1," You Will Adore this book: Out of all the cross stitch books I have ever owned, this one is my absolute favorite! The patterns are colorful and cute. They are adaptable to so many different projects. I cannot put this book down."
0, Not good: Advertised to curl and condition and it does neither. My hair was a bit wavier but oh so dry. NOT a good conditioner.
0, Below Average Vacuum Cleaner: I got this vacuum cleaner about a week ago andit is one of the best vacuum's I've ever had.It was not that difficult to put togetherbut you do need a screwdriver and you haveto look for the 4-6 screws that come with it.All in all a good name brand vacuum fro ma good companyat a great price that works well and does a good job vacuumingmy carpet.Update: This vacuum cleaner broke after a monthof using it. It was easy to assemble but workslike crap and my older vacuum cleaner workedbetter then this. The parts are cheaply madeand the model is of poor construction.It makes a loud noise and is hard to pushand even operate at times.I change my rating from 4 stars to 2 starsfor this product.
0," A Total Misfire!! BUYER BEWARE!!: I have to say I was diappointed ""Vehicle"" was not included because I thought it was his best song he sang, though I was not unhappy that he did not include ""Inside Your Heaven"" but listening to this so-called music, I wonder why he bothered not including it when everything else is about as sugary and fake as that song was. I could understand if everything else was cutting edge, but this is just bad elevator music. ALL OF IT.You can tell whe an album is bad when it came out yesterday and there are already so many used ones for sale- I just wish I could add mine to the bunch, but it ain't worth a nickel if you ask me."
0," poor quality ? d/t made in China: I've had this unit less than a year, first the clips on the base cracked within a few wks, then a piece of the heating unit cracked & broke off, finally the whole frame on heating unit fell off. All this after careful use of the unit. I just received a replacement ( had to pay shipping cost), I don't expect any better results as it is the same product. Shame on Cuisinart, I trusted your brand name. Never again."
1," Great!: This product makes shaving sooo much more comfortable than shaving within regular shaving cream. If you have a rough beard like I do, you should absolutely try it!"
1," Surprisingly Good!: Read a few reviews and set my expectations fairly low. I didn't think the story line was going to be cohesive and just thought this movie was going to be some good eye candy.I was pleasantly surprised and I like the movie a lot. It was a bit slow in the beginning, some of the characters (as opposed to the actual actors) were a bit over the top, but seeing Brooklyn Decker always keeps me interested. I even caught myself pumping my fist in triumph when the good guys succeeded (trying not to spoil anything here, so I'm being generic)!I would watch this movie again and again and recommend it to anyone interested in seeing an action movie.I can't wait to get it for my step-father who's a retired Navy chief. This will replace Top Gun as his favorite ""Pro-Navy"" movie."
1," I love the Lesbian People: I love the Lesbian people. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read that helps us raise our children in a difficult, homophobic world. Highly recommended."
0," Like wading through molases!: I just could not wade through all the initial detail. I'm usually a patient reader, and I've enjoyed other works by Drury, but I couldn't get through chapter 1."
1," Good, but not the best...: I would say this is vintage Sting, in that, like all other Sting albums, it is quite different than those that came before it. I don't think Brand New Day has the poetic lyrics of Nothing Like the Sun or the great variety of style in Mercury Falling, but I am pleased with Sting's newest endeavor. I wasn't too impressed the first time I listened to this, but I have played it twice more, and I have enjoyed it more each time, so be patient! I do have to say that this album lacks the almost scary clarity of Sting's voice (which is the best part, in my humble opinon) -- too often the vocals are lost within the music."
0," Do NOT buy this!: Today I purchased a 40 GB ""Flash-Hd to Go"" and have spent the last 3 hours attempting to: 1. load the software (totally un-intuitive experience) ultimately without success; 2. after multiple trial and error attemts, transfer pictures from a 512 MG Fuji Film chip, again without ANY help from the 4 page so-called Users Guide, which transer according to the, again, un intuitive, device screen apppears to have occurred; and 3. transfer the pictures to my Windows XP Professional 240 GB computer, with NO success and NO help from either the laughably inadequate 'Users Guide"" or the manufacturers web page. It has been a frustrating and exasperating experience that I would not wish on any enemy, much less a friend. It goes back to the vendor tomorrow for a full refund.This manufacturer should go out of business, and fast, if its so called Users Guide and Web Page Support are an indication of how it advises its customers on product installation and use!Good Riddance! An afternoon wasted!"
0," internet/mobile bluetooth: i would love to give a review, but have NEVER received the product so i can't tell you a thing about it..."
1," Great movie.: Night of the Hunter is such a good movie. I am glad Robert Mitchum got the part, because to me, he makes this film. His portrayal of a religious fanatic after some money was spot on, especially the part where he uses the words ""love"" and ""hate"" on his fingers as an example of the battles between good and evil. Robert Mitchum made Harry Powell a man most people would most likely hate, and he did a very good job at it. One of my favorite scenes from the entire movie is the river scene. The song makes it even better. I give this movie four stars!"
0," Avoid at ALL costs: This is the absolute worst product i have seen in my entire lifetime! I tried to connect it to my Ps2, which the people at linksys said would work (it would not communicate with my 802.11B Linksys router). i followed all of the included instructions (from linksys) and all of the Ps2 instructions and.... nothing. so, i called Linksys and was put on hold for at least a half hour (no exaggeration) and then talked to a person who barely spoke english and had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. this person told me to change a lot of DOS settings on my windows XP computer, which really screwed it up. i finally gave up and took the piece of junk back. i will never again buy a Linksys product ever again."
1, Indiana Jones: This is a great collection of classic films. The sound and video quality are excellent. I highly recommend this collection to any Indiana Jones fan.
1," They do it again!: Tell me, can these guys make a bad album? So far I've been blown away by every album I've picked up by this band & there seems to be no sign of them slowing down. 'Worlds Apart' is Silent Force's third album, & it continues to show how this band brilliantly takes power metal to another level. OK, so ""brilliant"" might be a bit of an exaggeration, but in a world full of power metal bands it's nice to be able to identify bands that stand out on their own & not sound completely like all of the other well known bands that are on the scene such as Primal Fear or Metalium, or maybe even the almighty Hammerfall. I still think so far 'Empire of Future' is the best album from Silent Force, but believe me you won't be disappointed with ANY release from this band, & this one is definitely no exception!"
0," Make sure this supports your camera's RAW images: I bought the software ( Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same. So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which Canon camera made the image. So far, there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package."
0," Software locks up Windows XP: This Organizer is a real neat idea, to bad the software doesn't work.It cost me 50 dollars to get my computer running again, after it locked up. I will call tech support on monday, but from the sound of the other reviews, I don't think I will get any help. Without the software it's just about worthless, I can store my CDs on a shelf a whole lot cheaper! UPDATE!!! I contactedKDS and got a patch for windows XP. It now works like it is supposed to. I have been using it for a couple of weeks with no problems. It's to bad that KDS didn't have the organizer working like this in the begining."

0," Hancuffed Consumer vs. Customer Service: I have 2 kids and together they have about 8 various vehicles that take the flexpack ""flash charge"" battery. My kids LOVE their Speed Wrenches and their Jack Knife(s). The Motocross Bikes are awesome too. Anyway, I was told by the company about 1.5 years ago that they were going to sell the batteries seperately. Well, to my knowledge, they never have. I would love to be able to buy the battery separately. I cannot afford to but the charger every time I purchase a battery. I am very disappointed about this ""handcuffing"" of me the consumer. They have the monopoly on the flexpack and are using it to force you to buy the charger since the bateries are not sold separately. I was told that they would be about 9.99 alone. I would buy about 8 more for extras. What ever happened to customer service? Please start selling the batteries seperately."
0, The Beatles Happy Go Lucky Kids? Or Lucifers Demonic Agents?: The Beatles Seem to be the perfect symbols of the 6o's...

1," Great Game!: This is a great game for Dreamcast. It has amazing graphics, sound, and tunes. When I first got it I was a little dissapointed, but then I began to really enjoy the game. There are only two cities, but they are huge. You can travel offroad, and even under water. I recommend this to Dreamcast owners. Also, make sure you check out Soul Calibur and NFL 2K."

0," Slow, cheap.: This is definitely Irwin's low end bit. I drilled some test holes in wood (older Douglas Fir which is pretty hard). Compared to old somewhat dull Dewalt bits, these were slower, got hotter faster, and were generally unpleasant to use. The 1/8"" bit broke after 6 holes."

1," Love from Lisa, Dale, Scott, Janet, Sherry, Nancy, Don, Kate: I can't believe this...I saw you guys open for Ann and Nancy Wilson in Seattle a couple of years ago and you blew me and my friends away. We wanted to jump on stage and just rock with you. Man! We RAWKED SOOO Hard that night. We didn't want it to end. I ran across you guys on Amazon and this CD is amazing! Did everyone hear that. They are one of the best live bands I've ever seen. Are you guys huge yet? We all have huge crushes on you, the most beautiful, energetic all female band, ever. All of us, men and women. Pope Jane is SO AMAZING! So Full of Raw Desire...Superstars. Better than the Indigo Girls, more powerful than Ani DiFranco, able to leap tall buildings with a single song, faster than Sheryl or Sarah. The singer reminded us of a young Ann Wilson. And isn't that Kelly Strantz managing you. She's good. No B.S. and pretty powerful in this town. She's a keeper too. Love you guys and see you at the Grammy's. People, buy this CD."
1," FANTASTIC MOVIE, with stunning actors/actresses: At first I was sceptical of the quality of this film, because of the title, the plot . . . it didn't sound sound very exciting. But I can assure you, this movie is VERY good. Cook (Abby), Dunst (Verena), and Hoffman (Odette) played inspiring characters, and less known Keena (Tinka), and Kartheiser (Snake) were fabulous and are great new actors! I found the idea of the DAR (Daughters of the American Ravioli) very inspiring. The whole movie gives young women courage. It tells a wonderful story about five girls with ambition and plans, it tells about the obstacles they overcome. I definately recommend this movie!"
1," Great: This was a great read, a little slow in some places, but still a good book. I can.t wait to read the sister.s story"
0," This book doesn't work: Color me disappointed. I admit that after reading ""How to Avoid Huge Ships,"" I've had no issues whatsoever with tankers in the 320,000 DWT and over class. But this book has provided absolutely *no* protection from ships between 80,000 and 160,000 DWT. While I realize vessels of this size may constitute ""large"" in some maritime parlance, I'm here to tell you from bitter experience that if you're run down by one of these behemoths, they seem plenty huge enough. I urge Captain Trimmer to be more specific in the titling of future books regarding substantial watercraft."

1," Prepare yourself for terror!: I just completed reading this book at midnight. I cannot sleep. I'm scared of the diabolical inhabiting my neighborhood and Stephen King planted the seed of my recently acquired paranoia.This book will haunt you. The characters created by Mr. King are very real and his ability to make them so real is frightening in and of itself. The town of Derry is a setting not unlike my own community and probably a bit like yours as well. The meshing of plausibility with the paranormal confront you with terror and it is unrelenting.""Fiction is the truth inside the lie, and the truth of my fiction is simple: the magic exists"" Stephen KingWrite on Stephen!"
1," Dave's Not Here...: We've all had those times where we got blazed with a couple of friends, and then couldn't decide whether we wanted to listen to music, or eat, or sleep or whatever. All you need is this Cheech and Chong CD, some munchies, and your set. This CD is so kick-ass when you're herbalized. After you listen to ""Dave"" you'll bust a gut laughing before you even know it. ""Basketball Jones"" is a killer as well, the sexy cheerleader vocals and hilarious lyrics make it a definate C&C; favorite. Many times I've caught myself headbanging to ""Earache my Eye"", that catchy guitar riff is still stuck in my head to this day. But the biggest gut-buster of the whole album is in ""Sergeant Stadanko"" when Chong says ""Well if it's oregano, you can put it in your soup and eat it. You beaner!"" I nearly wet myself with laughter. I guess you had to be there... Oh well. Everyone should hear this CD, pure genius!Donkey smell..."
0," mawkish: silly, mawkish, trite, stereotypical. So many adjectives to apply to this poor novel. Was there a plot? I couldn't find it. I couldn't finish it either."
1," An album to listen to when alone with someone you love.: ""So Tonight That I May See"" is an album of such feeling and texture, it is impossible to acurately describe it without having listen to it. If you want a rich melodic album, then by all means, buy this album. If you dont like to think while listening to music, do not buy this album. This album forces you to think and feel about what is being said, and what is being played. When you are alone at night, with the person of your dreams, put this on, and listen to it together. You may come away with a deeper understanding of how music can effect people emotionaly, and spirtually. Then again, I could be wrong, its only my opinion. =)"
0," Gremlins 3 gone wrong!: OK, I'm a fan of Del Toro and he produced this garbage so that made me interested enough to watch it.Yes to a pretty cool Gothic feel to it, although the mansion interior is a total copy of ""drag me to hell"" (which was a MUCH better movie anyway).Every time I watch ""Pieces of April"" I just can't believe how GREAT Katie Holmes was in it, but here she is a complete mess..she has absolutely NO idea of what she's doing...btw, what else has she done even close to that first movie???Guy Pierce is another talent who's a total waste here...btw, what else has he done even close to ""Memento""???The girl Bailee is just OK...actually annoying so I couldn't wait for the creatures to get rid of her.This is an attempt to do a Gremlins part 3, but that has gone totally wrong!NO humor at all, and absolutely FULL of plot holes.I couldn't believe about how bad it was 99% of the time (and I REALLY wanted to like it! I mean it!)DO NOT waste your time."

1," This book makes auditing as fun as possible: I used this book for an auditing class and I got a lot out of it. The book sets each chapter up in an understandable, and digestable way.The tables and charts are excellent summaries of the reading and it is entirely possible to just skip the reading and memorize those. Each chapter has thought-provoking questions at the end and activities that are helpful in analyzation. This book takes you from the first step in auditing to the way to fill out the audit report. I have fond feelings for this book."
1," A great action playset: i have recently purchased the skull island playset, and several others, all very great toys, this figure set is amazing! Kong and these bat like creatures, can have so many adventures and more as you control kong to punch and bash the terapusmordax. I think this is a very great figure pack for all ages because there is nothing little ones could choke on, and both figures are very durable, (not easily broken). I give this set 5 stars for great entertaiment and durabilaty. bad grammar, sorry.."
1," GOOD GUIDE: Give you all the proper maps you need,all the upgrades you should get.pretty clear and concise guide thumbs up"
1," Billy Joel's Social Conscience: ""The Nylon Curtain"" was Billy Joel's attempt to challenge Bruce Springsteen for the hearts and minds of heartland rockers. His catchy unemployment anthem ""Allentown"" may have been the most misunderstood ode to the down and out this side of the Boss's ""Born in the U.S.A."" For good measure, Joel also throws in a Vietnam Veterans tribute in ""Goodnight Saigon."" The more lightheartead ""Pressure"" was also a big hit. Coupled with another decent single in ""She's Right on Time,"" this album could have been Joel's best if it didn't peter out with less successful filler material in the second half. As a result, it confirms Joel's status as an artist more adept at producing singles than fully realized albums."
1," There may be more scholarly treatments...: There may be more scholarly treatments but the impact that this little book gives the reader makes it one of the most important books you can buy.

1," A major book!: I read this book prior to buying for my grandson. I was so transported by the beautiful writing, descriptive stories, I felt like I could hear and see the forest. I laughed, cried, and learned. Have recommended repeatedly."
1," Best of Ozzfest 2002!: I first heard these guys on the Ozzfest 2002 sampler. When Ozzfest came around they were the first band of the day and in the top 5 best(along with Ozzy, SOAD, Rob Zombie, and Ill Nino)Although they are way better(and not to mention a lot heavier) live, this is still a great disk. There aren't really any bad songs here but some standouts are Ride of your life, (I feel)Down, Said She, All my friends crush you, and I like It(one Way)Kelly, the lead singer has a voice reminescent of Layne Staley and the band kind of remind me of Alice in Chains but you would never confuse the two bands. I would definetely reccommend that any metalhead looking for some more straightforward rock pick this one up. You've got to see em live!"
0," No a very good book.: I did not find the book to be very helpful at all. It's confusing, seems to have no direction. As an SBS consultant, I was not at all happy with this book. It offered me no genine insight."

The tap is much smaller than it appears (6 inches tall) and is simply two cone shaped pieces of plastic that fit together. The plastic is cheap and scratched... this item is WAYYYY overpriced. Upon delivery there are no instructions or materials for customizing it. I feel like I got taken advantage of."
1, A Very Analytical Point of View: The Author of this CD really took his time to study about this subject. It is really in depth but has very real ideas or theories that can be applied to everyday life. There is a lot of detail so it can seem somewhat boring but if you have a desire to improve in this area then this is book can be very helpful.
0, Week Battery and Signal Strength: I am using this phone for last one month. This phone really looks great in terms of features.

1," great product: I love this little IPod. It is very hardy after a few days I accidently dropped it in some water and it still plays ;like new. I put both music and books on it.

Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead, it's going back for sure."
0," Just Like Everybody Else: I love Godhead, and I love how original they sound. Nothingness, Power Tool Stigmata, and 2000 Years of Human Error all displayed their unique approach to industrial and metal. All three albums had their distinct sound and style, but they all blended the electronic sounds and samples with metal guitar. Sadly, with Evovler, they seem to almost leave behind their industrial roots and opt for a more straightforward metal album. I don't feel that Jason's vocals suit this style, either. On past albums his voice seemed perfect for every song, but he does not have a purely metal singing voice. I understand that they wanted a stripped down album in order for them to all play the song exactly as it sounds live. Or their attempts at commercial success after years of sounding innovative without much recognition, and their constant moves from one label to another. I just wish they wouldn't have sacrificed some of their original sound in the process."
0," Phee-yew: Four short romance stories that all had resolutions which were obvious; unsubtle and (worst sin of all) boring. Don't waste your time or money. The last story by Joan Johnston had the most interesting plot, and that gains my 2 stars. But even it was predictable and lacked tension."
0," Wait for the originals: We all love the original Star Wars movies don't we? Well most of us at least.These are not the original movies, they are tidied up versions with 'extra' scenes. The cleaning up of the special effects is effective in places, however the extra content is not.What has been done is to add ridiculous, ill-fitting CGI sequences in order to prepare us for the lamentably poor prequels. We get a daft sequence of Han-Solo talking to a CGI Jabba which looks like a college graphics project. Worst of all is the new song and dance routine in Return of the Jedi which makes Fraggle Rock look like West Side Story.A digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable, these tacky cash-ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of Black & White classics."
0," Great design. Too bad it is not reliable: I have owned many mp3 players and i can say that this unit sported by far the best design.

Too bad."
0," Really disappointing camera: I have a canon S3 IS and can say it is a really good camera. Based on my experienced with my S3 IS and reading some reviews I decided to give this A570IS camera to my wife.I bought the first one some time ago and it arrived dead. I returned it and decided not to buy another A570IS one, but considering good reviews here in Amazon I decided to give a second tryThe second one works (I guess) fine, but, I doesn't work with NiMh rechargeable batteries. The same batteries working with my Canon S3 IS doesn't work with this A570IS. Batteries going fully charged directly from the charger to the camera seem to be discharged for the canon A570IS. Since using Alkalines is a waste of money with digital cameras I don't know what else to do. I guess my best option is return this second one and forget about this canon A570IS."

1," Excellent book to learn about the impacts of El Nino!: The author explains in very clear language the complicated El Nino phenomenon and its far-reaching ecological, social, economic and political impacts during the last few centuries. The book is an excellent example of how an interdisciplinary approach can shed light on a complex oceanic-meteorological event and its ramifications throughout the world and human history. The author weaves meteorology, oceanography, history, economics, ecology, and political and social sciences in to a rich account of the history of El Nino. The book is founded on thorough scientific research, yet completely comprehensible for a lay person like me. The clear style of writing kept my attention to the last page. The numerous illustrations and graphs are very effective and helpful. Anybody who is interested in El Nino and its impact on human events will find this a very insightful book."
1," Let's play Golf....on Game Boy: If you have played Golf before, then you know what to expect: 18 holes, swing at the ball, aim for the hole. There are two courses to choose from: US Course and Japan Course. The holes would take place in, obviously, America or Japan.The one problem I have with this game is that it can be difficult to get a Par or anything above that point. It's still just as fun to play as real golf, though. There are different clubs to choose from, and the holes are well-designed, despite the difficulty getting a Par and above.Not only is this Golf, but it's Golf on the go. You can play through the 18 holes in the US and Japan courses while in the car. Meanwhile, several other golf games pop up over the years. This is still one golf game you should try out, though. I really have nothing else to say. All I can say now is: It's golf, and golf is a good sport."
0," Waste of Money: The good things...the mobile is very cute and I like the song choices.The bad... the mobile broke in less than one week of use! The aquarium sounds feature began making just white noise and wouldn't stop until I took the batteries out. Also, the lights that the mobile projects began to get too dim to notice.I exchanged the mobile and the second one had the same flaws. In addition, the mobile does not turn unless I push it to get it started. The music will play for so long that it runs the batteries dead within about a week, and the batteries are a pain to change because you have to take it off the crib and unscrew the battery cover. During this process, the fish usually fall off of the mobile.I kept the second mobile for looks only. I don't bother using it's mechanical features anymore. Save your money!"
1, Great Recording: Very essential Music.The Arrangements&Styles work very well.He has Great Depth&feel here.it's Classic Ellington.He was always Constantly Changing Music.
1," Innuendo or not, this is still a good album: I've been a fan of Queen for a long time. Yes this was the last album they put out before Freddie Mercury succumbed to AIDS, but it is such a great album. This album does not have all the different arrangements as albums in the past. It still rocks though. People always give the earlier albums of artists more props than their more current stuff and it is a shame. If you enjoy Queen's legacy give this album a go and really listen to it with open ears. It isn't much different in reality to earlier albums. Innuendo kicks with a punch and it was a fitting title for the end of their original line up and it did put a stamp on the 70's and 80's even though it came out in 1991. Pick this album up and have a fun time."
1," OK game: A good game, yet, I find it lacks something. At last I found what it was, multiplayer(at least 2 player team battle). Other than that it is a great game. My favorite gun personaly has to be either the Shotgun or the Sniper Rifle. The game is so realistic it is amazing."

1," Not quite as good as I remember it was...: Still an entertaining read after all these years, but it doesn't hold up to the passage of time as well as I thought it would. When I first read the Shannara series (back in the mid-80's I believe) I remember being totally captivated by the story and the characters, but 20 some years later it just doesn't satisfy nearly as well. The story seems hurried, the characters a bit thin, and the magic just isn't there. I still enjoy Terry Brooks writing, but after having read LOTR several times in between Shannara reads, it's now obvious just how blatant the copy of the story and characters is. I'll still continue to read some Brooks novels, but with less enthusiasm than I did when I was much younger, probably still a good series for younger readers to sink their teeth into however..."

1," Inspirational and Informative: This book is a well written, accurate depiction of women in funeral service. It is a must read for anyone, women in particular, who are thinking about a career in funeral service. This book was the catalyst for my entry into the world of funeral directing."
0," Don't be Fooled: I purchased this flatware set earlier this summer. I thought that it had to be great quality stuff, because it was very heavy and I bought it from a reputable department store. Boy, was I wrong. I washed my set one time in the dishwasher and almost all of the pieces had rusted while in there. The cycle was 45 minutes long and it had a heated drying cycle. So it is not like my flatware was lying in puddles of water. I am very disappointed with the quality of this flatware. I should have purchased the Onieda flatware like my mom said. Be smart...go with someone else for your flatware needs."
0, Getting worse each edition!: CHECK EVERY PROBLEM - I just worked through the composite beam chapter 16 and the errors are prolific!?!#$# So bad that you begin to question yourself! I have the earlier editions from the 1970's which are great and I have used them continuously over the years as reference. Obviosly the new edition is LRFD and not ASD but I am extremely disappointed in the number of errors.
1," Nice Helmet: It's a good basic 3/4 face helmet. Don't be scared by the description saying ""Scooter"" helmet, it's a standard DOT approved motorcycle helmet. Most people will want a face shield too though, unless you enjoy the taste of bugs."
1, The Dalai Lama: Very well researched and informative. A must read for those interested in the Dalai Lama.
0," Already thrown away.: This case looks very cute in the picture, but once you put it on, it sticks up so high off the iPod that it's ridiculous and makes the buttons hard to touch."
0," used a couple of times and it just quit working: Purchased one early this year. I have emailed the company, The Price Pros with a question, possibly a problem with the heater, and have not had any response from them. The heater itself worked fine until it just cut off and never came back on. Not a happy camper here."
1," Comparitively one of the best of '99: With a hit song leading the way like 'Simon Says' and amazing tracks such as Queens, The Truth etc. this is easily one of the greatest albums of 99'. Pharoahe easily outshines Jigga and DMX and other more popular artists who came out with chart topping albums this year. I'd say that Pharoahe is just as conscious and clever as Mos Def is lyrically, but Pharoahe's music and style is just more high powered and bumping. Rawkus records will be rising in the new millenium, no doubt."
0," GoodWill or Trashcan?: I purchased this dvd expecting a great workout after reading the reviews.I did not find it anywhere as effective as Jillian Smith's Shread it with weights.Jillian's works multiple parts of your body, and seems very current. Angie'sis monotonous and only specific parts of my butt were sore/worked out.My advice, look elsewhere if you want to spend your workout time gettingresults. I have also heard that there are free kettlebell workouts online."
1," Good-looking piece for the price.: This changing table is very sturdy and solid. It's got a lot of storage space, especially behind the cabinet door, and the drawers are fairly deep.I had no problems putting it together by myself (even at eight months' pregnant!) but it was a time-consuming process. It took me close to two hours to finish.For the price, this is a pretty nice piece. It has the appearance of being high-end without actually being high-end: the drawer insides are made of a lightweight material similar to balsa, the drawer bottoms are made of stiff, laminated pressboard and the back of the unit is made of even stiffer pressboard. The exterior of the unit is made of heavy, solid wood."
1," Extremely useful product!: If you have dust in your DSLR camera, then go ahead and buy this! It works like magic. Just remember that if you have dust on your sensor, then you're going to have to turn the camera on, put it on BULB mode and then press AND HOLD the shutter (so you can access the sensor) and at the same time use this blaster in order to get the dust off the sensor."
0," Marginal product: I ordered the case to protect my wife's new machine but was disappointed in the quality and design. Inside the top of the box where the handle mounts, the metal strap was rusted. My concern was a few years from now carrying the machine by the handle of this case and having the handle fall off destroying the sewing machine when it hits the floor. If this manufacturer uses cheap metal that rusts, they may also use cheap plastic which becomes brittle. This caused me to evaluate the fasteners on the side. I would have preferred to see rivets here securely connecting the side latches fully through the case. We don't want a latch to fail causing the machine to fall out the bottom of the case. This storage box may be cost affective for the manufacture to assemble but do you want to spend your hard earned money on a nice sewing machine only to see it destroyed after falling out of this storage box? I may be critical on the quality of this box but I'm also an automotive engineer."
1," Had more features than other brands: I purchased this UPS for my desktop computer. I have no available USB ports on my computer, so I was really concerned about where I would plug in a UPS to enable automatic shutdown. I started looking around online and found that Cyberpower included serial connectors on their UPS models. This was perfect because my computer had the available serial port. It's actually nice to be able to put that port to use, because otherwise I would never use that port. I don't know why other brands don't include a serial connector as well. The only small negative, is that Cyberpower does not include a serial cable! So I had to purchase one of those separately. Everything was easy to use and install. I've had no problems with it. I feel protected from surges and power failures. I would recommend the product!"
1, SURGE PROTECTOR: I plugged it in and it works.I guess i will have to be hit by lighting to see the true value of this product.
0," Mastering the ""Basics"" of Windows 98: This is a very long and expensive book for people who have never previously encountered a drop-down menu, and who might benefit from an explanation of the intricacies of mouse clicking. I expected 1623 pages and two CDs would do more than describe dialog boxes. I expected technical insights that would aid me in troubleshooting--and find myself disappointed."
0, THIS BELT SMELLS SOOOOOOO BAD: THIS BELT SMELLS SOOO HORRIBLY BAD!!! I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PLASTIC AND AIRED IT OUT FOR OVER A WEEK IN A SPARE BEDROOM. THE WHOLE DOWNSTAIRS SMELT OF THIS ODOR SO I HAD TO THROW IT OUT. I COULD NOT STAND TO EVEN RE-PACK IT!WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BELT!
0," not so great: This slip cover feels really nice, but never stayed smooth, and looked really sloppy. Plus the sizing was odd. I ordered what was supposed to fit amply, and it was a stretch."
0," Paranormal: I am sorry I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She enjoys it, however the subject matter and the way it is presented leaves a lot to be desired. A waste of time and entertainment in my book."
1," Worth watching: Kevin Kline gives one of his best performances as a fill in president. Sigourney Weaver as the first lady. Frank Langella and Kevin Dunn as the presidents right hands. Ving Rhames as the Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the president. And Charles Grodin as Daves best friend, and a host of real life reporters and senators bring a very amusing story about a man chosen to temporary fill in for the president when he is incapacitated by a stroke, by a look-alike. He (Kline) proceeds to win over everybody, and makes the preident more popular than ever."
1, Lasted a Very Long Time: I needed a small case to hang from a belt loop or pocket book. This went with everything and is STILL looking great! Highly recommend.
1," Donald Fagen Establishes Himslef as a Solo Artist: The secind installemnt if the Travel Trilogy, Fagen with the help of producer and Steely Dan mate Walter Becker expolres new arrangments in Fusion. Fagen take you on a trip into the future in his futuristic car, ""The tech is Balinese"", he claims of his new ride, it has it all just like the recording. Sophisticated engineering and mastering by Becker make for an almost Steely Dan experience, but it's more than just that. It's truly a work of art. Fagen's imagination drives you to unknown destinations. Another audiophile must!"
1, What happened to that Big Draft Kerry said was coming in January '05????: It's now December and still no draft. Re-enrollment in the military is at it's highest ever. And we are winning the war in Iraq despite Kerry spinning it another way.2005 is almost over and still no draft Kerry. Time to come clean and admit you lied about the draft only to get votes. Time to apologize to all of those American boys and their parents that you scared half to death. It's the right thing to do. C'mon Kerry. Do the right thing ..... for a change!
1," A pleasant surprise: I can hardly top the endorsement from Elfman himself, but I can vouch for the originality of the approach. These songs span a variety of genres, though they mostly take the originals in a more jazzy direction. The exception is ""Nothing Bad Ever Happens,"" which ends up punkier than it ever was. The key to any good tribute song is being faithful to the spirit without slavishly copying the original. On this album, only ""Little Guns"" comes close to being a sound-alike -- and since it's a fun song anyway, that's fine. This is why the other Oingo Boingo tribute album, ""Dead Band's Party,"" was mostly a disappointment, since too many songs were note-for-note recreations. Not the case here. This would be a listenable compilation even if it wasn't a tribute album."
0," Used paperback: The ""used"" paperback had a moldy odor to it as if it had been in a damp basement for years. I would never purchase a ""used"" paperback again."
0," Great product but you can get it way cheaper: This is a really good product, but this price should be for the 16 0z bottle."
0," Good God, what is this THING?: This mockery of the Star Wars universe has to be the biggest waste of money I have ever been sucked into. (Next to the Jedi Academy Trilogy, that is.) These characters are NOT the characters we know and love from Star Wars. And Han and Leia's children... ordinarily, I would have loved a book that lets us get to know Jacen, Jaina and Anakin better. But THIS is ridiculous. The kids were much more interesting in the Corellian Trilogy.The only way I can appreciate this book is if I pretend it was all some big hallucination that Luke had after a visit to Yoda's dark side cave. Don't waste your time or money."
0," Not worth the price: I just received my Hohner Kazoo from the seller and am extremely disappointed. Although item amount is never specified, the picture that accompanies the listing is for a jar of kazoos.Now, I know that the pictures are not always accurate on Amazon but the original list price is $17.50 and the item weight is 8 ounces so don't think I am out of line for expecting more than one plastic kazoo. There is just no way that this is a $17.50 kazoo which means that I did not save 84% on this purchase when I paid $2.80 as it stated on the product page. I paid $2.80 for a $2.80 kazoo. Not much of a bargain when the same kazoo can be found at numerous sites on the web for 99 cents."
1," Excellent movie!: Highly recommend! This movie has so many good parts, I don't know where to start. Definitely worth watching!"
1," Sweet Deal!: Needed a spare HDMI for the bedroom lcd, the lcd is only a 720 so I figured this one would do just fine and it has done so! Picked it up for 0.39 W/FS Through Prime!"
1, Good value: Our son had this shower head installed in his house and we tried it out and thought it performed well. I saw this shower head in Amazon and had to order it as the price was right. Shower head is very functional serving as a rain shower and a hand held shower. Luv it!
1," somewhere in time dvd: This was a delightful film. The music alone makes it well worth watching. Seeing a young Christopher Reeve was sad but he did his best with this story, a bit ""smaarmy"" but I enjoyed it."
1," informative and extensive look on historical fashion!: An informative and extensive look on historical fashion, this book is quite useful for Artists, historians, and fashion designers! Covers historical eras I seldom hear about!"
0, gave it away: Ive never tried kc bar-b-q so i didnt know what it was going to taste like. When i finally got it i took one bite and eewwwww not the greatest taste.......not like any bar-b-q ive tasted. Jack links should take this beef steak off the market.......maybe ok for older people that cant tolerate hot food.....my older friend really liked it so i gave it to him. try the peppered beef steak by jack links its the best by far.
0," Beer mix is not what was stated in the product description: I have brewed my own beer numerous times via the ""more complicated"" systems. I purchased this kit as a gift for a Christmas gift exchange and therefor am not certain who it will end up with so I wanted something simple that I thought most people would enjoy. I have obviously not used it, so my rating is not based on that. When I ordered the product, the description said it came with the west coast pale ale mix...and when it arrived today it was the American light. Probably not a big deal for whoever ends up choosing the gift...but also not what was advertised which is a little annoying. Basically, just be careful when ordering if you are looking for a certain mix. Probably a good idea to just order the mix separately."
0," Could not get the cats to use the box: I had the highest hopes for this box & I have to say that the design is rather ingenious. I can't comment on the wet bottom issues that users descibe as I never got the kitties to even give the box a try. I think if I had it to do over again, I would *first* switch the cats to crystal litter *then* introduce the new box. I think both at once was just too much. On a very positive note, the company was remarkable about refunding all my money for the box and the unused cartridges. I was very impressed -- just sent them my Amazon invoices, they mailed me UPS return labels, and then sent a full refund check."
1," I miss Chahli! and true fans...: It's true, this album isn't as good as their first. I truly miss Chahli 2na but I really love the song with ""El Nino"" Poree finally throwing down some rhymes! They still fuse the funk and latin with ease too. I love the Brazilian influence on Suenos en Realidad. That's my new favorite, I think. OH, and for the reviewer from PA down there, TRUE FANS know that it's ""O- ZO- MAT- LI! Ya se fue! Ya se fue!"""
1, Great DVD for the family: I love seeing these Gomer Pyle DVD's. I watched this show when I was little and now my daughters can enjoy them. I wish more shows like this were on TV today.
1," A Great DVD!: I was lucky enough to be able to review this before it was released and I have to say that this was a great DVD that brought back my memories of sitting and watching this great cartoon on Saturday mornings when I was a child. The DVD was a great movie and my kids loved watching it with me as well. Ever since they saw theThe Smurfs (Two-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy), they have been hooked on the cartoon, so having this new movie to share with them just solidified their love of the little blue characters. The artistry of the film and the cartooning was amazing! Outside of the movie itself though the bonus features on this DVD were so much fun and you will leave watching them so much more ""in the know"" about Smurf lingo (my favorite) as well as character guide (a close #2) that will leave you knowing a bit about every smurf! Overall, this is a DVD that any Smurf fan will simply love!"
0," Gift Card Nightmare: I received an Amazon Gift Card as a workplace gift in August 2012. I'd previously ordered many products through Amazon with no problems. After placing my order using the gift card I could immediately tell the system hadn't applied my gift card to the order. After a couple of emails and one extended phone conversation I was told by Amazon CS on 8-10-12 that my gift card amount would be credited to my credit card. I checked with my bank on 8-22-12 and no credit was posted. I once again contacted Amazon CS and got yet another email reply saying my gift card amount would be applied to my credit card, in 4 or 5 business days. Exactly what I'd already been told back on August 10. I have yet to see any satisfactory resolution from my customer service runaround."
0," Disappointing: I had high expectations for this item, as I own several Cuisinart products. This skillet is very noisy when heating. I contacted Cuisinart, customer service asked to hear over the phone. They easily heard how much noise it makes. They sent a new controller. Same. They had me return the skillet ($15 - my cost) and sent a new one ($10 - my cost). Received the new skillet today. Yep, it is as noisy as the last one. Does it work? Yes. Is it annoying? Yes. And I had to pay an additional $25 to find out it is just the way it is designed. Very disappointed."
1," A wonderful series of books for all kids: I have read almost the entire series of the ""Junie B. Jones"" books aloud to my 9 year old daughter, who loves them and laughs out loud at Junie's antics. I volunteer in our local elementary school library where the librarian reads these easy chapter books to grades 4 - 6 and holds these kids in rapt attention. My youngest is in kindergarten (and much like Junie B) and his teacher had borrowed one of the books from me to read, because the library copies are always checked out by the ""big kids"". This is a WONDERFUL, ENTERTAINING series. One that is good for older kids to read on a rainy day, and a joy for parents to read at bed time. Cheers to Barbara Park for her wonderful character!"
1," Great sound and surprisingly sturdy: Because of the low price, I was worried that this portable CD player would break soon after purchase, or the sound would be terrible, or it would eat batteries ... something had to be wrong with it at that price, I thought. But after using it for a month I can say with confidence that it is a fine CD player -- much better than the Sony I had before, which cost three times as much. The Koss CD player spent an entire day with a six-year-old girl who dropped it repeatedly, and it emerged unscathed. I recently sent it sailing off my kitchen table to crash into my hardwood floor, and again it was completely fine. Great sound, very sturdy and you can't beat the price."
1," He is the master after all.: This book really does not have a lot of content or instruction. If you really want to learn more about pool you'll find more in other books by less prominent pool players (ie, Robert Byrne, Phil Capelle), but he does make some very good points about the fundamentals. However, above all other things, Willie Mosconi is the greatest pool player to have ever lived and any serious pool player should read his book out of respect if nothing else."
0, A rip off at half this price: Not worth your time. It is a bootleg-quality compilation of Charlie Parker tracks. Not all of them even feature Miles Davis. Sound quality is very poor. Look elsewhere for far better collections of this music.
1," Backlight won't work for long with rechargeable batteries: I've had the Sansa m240 for about six months. It plays my recorded podcasts well and battery life seems much longer than with the Creative Nano it replaced. One annoyance: I use rechargeable AAA batteries (1.2v), not alkaline AAA batteries (1.5v). I seems that the lower voltage rechargeables prevent the backlight on the display from working except when they are fully charged. Also, it feels kind of cheap in hand..but still worth the $20 I paid."
0," Awful salesman!: We never recieved the game we ordered. When he sent it the first it was wrong thing, sent it back wrong again. Then he tells us he does not have the game we ordered and it sold for 250 dollars. We had to get 3 games we did not even want. This is after 30 emails or more back and forth. It was ridiculous. I would advise anyone to never order anything from this company. I read other reviews and saw some people had same problems. Hope this tells everyone something. For others with same problems i know what you feel. Just keep emailing and maybe you will get right game. Thank you"
0," Terrible: These are hard to get on the dog's feet - they're hard to get adjusted, and they will not stay on! If he steps in just a few inches of powdery snow, the bootie comes off. The velcro straps are not secured to the bootie, so if the dog steps on an unraveling end, the whole bootie comes off - then you may lose the bootie AND the strap! I'm still looking for a better alternative, but havent come up with one yet."
0, Too much of John Wooden & not enough on drills.: John Wooden is an excellent coach but fails to meet the needs of teaching kids this game. His examples are with adults and kids are edited into the video. Everything he says is true and valuable however not interesting for my 8 year old or myself as a new coach.
0," Independent Student in California: THIS BOOK REALLY DOESN'T HELP THE STUDENT STUDYING ITALIAN ON THEIR OWN, AS IT DOESN'T GIVE THE CORRECT ANSWERS. YOU DO THE EXERICSES AND THEN WONDER IF YOU ARE GIVING THE RIGHT ANSWERS. A BETTER CHOICE OF BOOK FOR THE STUDENT STUDYING ITALIAN INDEPENDENTLY IS, ""LIVING ITALIAN"" BY MARIA VALGIMIGLI. THIS BOOK IS VERY AFFORDABLE, GIVES YOU EXERCISES TO DO WITH THE CORRECT ANSWERS IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK, AND COMES WITH A TAPE. ...."
1, Beautiful: These tea cups and saucers are a match to my dinnerware. They are the same fine quality and design. Lovely!
0, Hose Failure in less than 6 months: This unit was fine while it lasted; but it didn't last nearly long enough.I packed hose in the unit just the same as it was when rec'd. Pour hose material in my book.
0," Written by a pastor?: I read this book prior to becoming a follower of Christ. Even then, I was struck by how vague the author's reference to the God of the Bible was. I remembered about the book a couple of months ago. Found it on the shelf. Looked through the book. Looked up the author's oficial site. ""Dr. Gary Chapman seeks to fulfill his call to the ministry as a pastor, speaker, and author."" Written by a pastor? Not a single Bible verse in the whole entire book?"
0," Great Toaster, But Poor Plastic Fit & Finish: The KTT261 Kitchen Aid toaster makes great toast. The features are rich cpmpared to my old Krups toaster. However, the fit & finish above the ""Kitch Aid"" band was poor. It was cut crudely, had dimples and bowed out. This toaster works very well and would be a piece of art if not for the fit & finish of the plastic housing."
0," Lessons Learned: Gilgamesh is an epic tale that demonstrates, even though the story is thousands of years old, several lessons that can easily be applied to life in current times. Like Gilgamesh we all face challenges as he did in this story; an example of some of the lessons that he overcame that can be applied to our own realities would be Gilgamesh overcoming Enkidu's challege for his throne, Enkidu was as big and strong but Gilgamesh took on the challenge and ended up not just winning the battle but also he gained a new best friend. As their relationship grew so did their confidence in eachother and soon they decided to travel on a mission to kill the tremendous monster of the pine forest. The heroes set out on this journey with an intent to increase their power an infulence over their region of the world, but in the end they do far more than they ever imagined, learning that nothing ever last forever and that surrenders must be made in order for wisdom and happiness to prevail."
1," It leads you to a magical world: The first time I heard Loreena's music I was with my best friend at the University, ten years ago, trying to escape from the burdens of the world. He gave me a copy of ""The Visit"" and I loved every song. I didn't hear from Loreena again until February 2001, when I came into a music store and, by instinct, I bought a copy of ""Book of secrets"". This gorgeous piece of art transported me to a magical and enchanted place. It was like to be born again in some fantastic land lost between the memories of my childhood and the beginning of my adulthood as Loreena's crystal voice starts surrounding your soul in a soft and lovely atmosphere. ""The Mummer's dance""-one of my favorite pieces-is strongly linked to the most important and clue moments of my life. Every time I feel in a crossroad I play this song, close my eyes and, immediately, everything comes back to its original place."
0," Great book; terrible annotations: If you have not read these books and are the type of person to jump right to the last page, then this is the book for you. Tracy and Margaret have a terrific knack of hinting towards the next 100-150 pages with their little side blurbs. I cannot begin to tell you how many annotations begin with, ""as we discover later..."" It's like a cruel joke.I am on page 500 of this 1300 page book. At about page 300 I resolved to stop reading the sidebars. Unfortunately, when they place an asterick within the text and place a little one or two sentence blurb right beside it, before you know it you have already read it. Tracy and Margaret do a wonderful job of systematically destroying any suspense left in the book. If they would join my poker table, I could quit my day job.Read the books, they are quite good. Get versions without the annotations, they are quite bad."
0," have not received: this is terrible service...I ordered this product 1/29/07 and it hasn't arrived to date 02/12/07...I receive books via media mail in 3-5 days, can't believe the product isn't here...probably won't order from this person or Amazon again with this kind of service."
0, Makes you feel good (???): This book makes you feel good but in a false way. There are not many examples and only few practice tests.

1," IT'S AMAZING WHERE YOU CAN FIND SALVATION: AS A SMALL BOY IN THE SOUTH, DURING THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY ROBERT AND HIS TWO SISTERS WERE SOLD INTO SLAVERY TO A COTTON FARMER BY THEIR FATHER FOR A FEW DOLLARS. A FORM OF SLAVERY THAT WAS PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STATES THOUGH NEVER EXPOSED. ROBERT GREW UP UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES REMINISCENT OF ANTEBELLUM TIMES AND THE TWISTS AND TURNS HE HAD TO ADAPT TO WERE EXTRAORDINARY. WHAT THIS MAN WENT THROUGH AND OVERCAME INSPIRES GREAT HOPE.

1," Sexon's Work Is Both Gritty and Incandescent: To read the poetry of Anne Sexton is to drown in the moment between sleeping and waking. Although Sexton's poems range in tone from gritty to incandescent, her content is consistently sharp, insightful, and stinging. She's one of those rare talents who manages to write with a purpose AND a passion. The first time I read her work, the thought that sprang to mind was: ""Wow. She's writing what everyone else is only thinking."" Sexton has a great capacity to verbalize the unspeakable, and she does it in such a way that it scars you and heals you simultaneously. Take, for example, her ""Transformations"" series (the re-written fairy tales.) Here we have incest, beauty, fear, love, repression, magic...all tangled between translucent words with spines of steel. To say I am in awe of this book is to only scratch the surface."

0," Worked for 2 days then died, DO NOT PURCHASE.: I am beyond disappointed with this device, I purchased it from CompUSA and I have no problem with CompUSA, but the manufacture should take this off the shelf immediately, I had no choice but to trash it, I couldn't even take it back because I live 2 hours away! The amount I would have to pay in gas, this item has costed me over $100.I'm positive I'm not ever buying anything from the dlo manufacture, even if they deside to redesign a robust product, it's not worth it!I'd rather go with the original manufacture of the iPod for compatible peripherials!I'm sad to see this company still in business, they really need to be reported to the Better Business Bureau."
1," found a great way to re-use these: Our almost 6 year old boy will go through these really quickly (and he has 2 younger brothers who will like them sometime) so I cut the pages out of this book and slipped them inside Mead's sheet protectors for 3-ring binders. He completes the puzzles with overhead markers and then when he is done (or makes a mistake) we wipe it off with a wet cloth and it is like new again! He likes mazes, too, so I plan to do the same with the Usborne maze books."
0," Simply awful: This is the worst book I've finished in a long time. Only a sunny beach in Hawaii and no other book for days pulled me through. Thin, one-dimensional characters with ridiculously over-simplified emotions and ham-fisted clunky dialogue abound in this adolescent teleportation fantasy. Perhaps an introverted teen (from the eighties) might find the characters intriguing, but any mature reader, even a sci-fi fan, would have a hard time not laughing at most of it."
0," Expected So Much and Got So Little: Over the years I've purchased several books which were recommended by Don Imus. All of his previous selections have been outstanding. I'm not sure if he really read this book cover to cover. There are funnier books you can read and there are more religious books you can read. I just did not ""get it"" from this book. Father Joe by all accounts was a wonderful man, maybe a book solely on his life would have been more worth while. If there wasn't all the hype surrounding this book maybe I would not have been disappointed. I expected so much and got so little."
1," Kindle 3?: I love my Kindle 2! I just got it four days ago. I use it mainly to read fiction, poetry and non-fiction that can be read cursively and sequentially. But for my social sciences books, which I need to browse and have an overall view from the outset, I will still use the hard copies. At least these days I'm reading more, thanks to Kindle.BUT, I've heard a rumor that Kindle 3 is right around the corner, and will be out ""sometime this week"" and, more importantly, that it will have a bigger screen. Here is the link to this article: http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/03/nyt-big-screen-kindle-coming-from-amazon-this-week/Can anyone, please, confirm to me if this is true?Thank you."
1, A surprise: I ordered this book expecting your typical sex manual/self-help guide. It is so much more than that. It deals with all the aspects of the Kama Sutra including the emotional link required to make this work.I loved this book.
0," Has anyone seen Patricia Cornwell???: Has anyone seen Patricia Cornwell???Without doubt, this was the WORST book I have ever FORCED myself to read. Cornwell could NOT have written this piece of junk. I have LOVED all of Cornwell's previous books and am appalled at this work. Don't waste your time and money. Frankly, I want my money back. It really deserves NO STARS."
1," Temianka - as good a writer as musician: Henri Temianka was one of the last of the old-school grand musicians. Aside from the fact that he was a brilliant violinist, he shows his talent as an author in this informative and entertaining volume. He shares dozens of stories about his musical relationships with other famous and not so famous artists, composers and managers.I learned a lot from this book which surprised me because I thought it would be just another series of embellished personal stories in the guise of a biography. The book was excellent and offered behind the scenes glimpses of the concert world and the zany things that can happen to a concert artist."
0," BORING AS HELL: This game is a major drag. Actually, maybe I shouldn't call it a game but a movie (CARTOON), because you really don't get to play. For the most part you just get to watch and listen to the endless boring dialogue between the uninteresting characters. The only purpse you serve is to direct the characters to the red arrows, so you can watch a little movie/video clip. The fighting scenes aren't much better, you get to choose a target and mode of attack, than as usual you get to watch.The graphics are really good, but if I wanted a video/movie or whatever you want to call it than I'd watch a movie, and I would choose one with a better story."
0," You have to be in the right mood: With the exception of a few tracks, this CD mostly consists of noise, dissonance, and screaming. Definitely better than nu-metal, but still not something I listen to on a regular basis. It's not bad if I'm in a really grouchy mood and need to let off a little steam."
1, too melodic: don't get me wrong man i love dream theater they are the best ever but they were too melodic bak then i hate all the boring slow stuff like learning to live and waiting 4 sleep give me shredding that's real talent kevin moore is so boring i don't know why he was ever in dream theater think god they replaced him with a real keyboarder like jordan rudess kevin is almost as bad as yanni. train of thougth is teh best evear.
1," masterpiece of electronic music: This was the 5th album that Klaus Schulze released and what an absolute classic this one is! Side one (""Bayreuth return"") must rank as an all-time great electronic piece. I recently read that it was recorded just on 2-track and in one go which makes it even more unbelievable when you're listening to complexity of the arrangements it has. Timewind features some beautiful sequencer work and atmospheres that makes this one more ""accessible"" as the albums that were released before. So, all in all it's a good starting point to begin your Klaus Schulze collection!"
1," The perfect system for my small living room!: I live in an apartment and am very cramped for space. The Ensemble 4 surround sound speakers are the ideal solution for me. They are small and unobtrusive, yet they sound really great! My friends can't believe that all that sound is coming from those little speakers. The woofer hides under an end table and the small speakers are mounted on the wall. I would highly recommend this system to anyone that is looking for big sound from small speakers...oh yeah, and the price absolutely can not be beat- I know, I shopped around!"
0," huge disappointment: like most of you, i LOVED songs for the deaf, and i enjoyed lullabies to paralyze enough to buy era vulgaris. but when i got it home and started listening, i was thoroughly disappointed.i'll admit,some of the songs have a certain appeal that grows on you the more you listen. especially the first two:turning on the screw and sick sick sick. another halfway decent song is suture up your future. the only 2 good songs on the album are make it wit chu (a great song) and 3's and 7's (my favorite queens song.) but everything else is an obscure attempt at pushing artisitic creativity to the point where the album just becomes bad.i give this album 1 and a half stars.do NOT buy it.no matter how much you love the band."
1," psychologist w/ ADD's view: one of my specialties is therapy w/ adult ADD folks, including myself. I'm unusually happily married this time. this book wld be very useful for folks who learn thru reading, both ADD folks & those who love them. the religious references can be ignored if not relevant to u. Dr Bob"
0, Crap: The cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone. This cord is pure crap.
1," Why Irish eyes are smiling.: Any fan of Irish folk music must have this one. My favourite is 'Seven Drunken Nights' but just about every classic Irish song is on this one. Some songs I hadn't heard for many years and hearing them again was like meeting an old, dear, long-lost friend. Some tracks are repeated with live recordings but the overall enjoyment is undeniable: so pour yourself a pint or three of Guinness, sit yourself down in a nice cosy armchair near a blazing log fire, and enjoy!"
1, No illusions: This little book reflects the reality of infantry life better than 99% of military histories.

0," Disappointment: This product appears not to work under Windows XP. To make matters worse, there is no product support! It took almost two months to get a reply from product support and then the answer didn't pertain to my problem. I had to discard this product and purchase another, thus being out the cost of the product entirely."
0," Please do not bother: I, like many people, was a big fan of Scott Smith's book, A Simple Plan. What set it apart from others in the genre was a well thought out plot with twists and turns you did not see coming. Unfortunately the same is not true of The Ruins. As engrossing as A Simple Plan's plot was, this one is just as flat out boring. I saw the end coming a third into the book but kept kidding myself that because it was Scott Smith something big would happen. Needless to say - it never did. I would rank this as mediocre in the cheap horror genre at best. I have not been this disappointed in a novel in several years. I hope Smith's next novel is better than this but am not sure I would read it to find out."
0," Short, Mildly Entertaining & Anti-American: I purchased this book in a airport bookstore primarily due to a lack of good books to choose from. This particular book looked like a humorous quick read, which it was. Actually, it read too fast (took me under 1 hour) and took constant jabs at American business and culture. Written by a French author, I wasn't surprised by the blatant anti-Americanism, and I would guess her cynicism towards business culture will be received the wrong way by many readers in France, where this book has already sold 300,000+ copies. In fairness to the author, she did also poke fun at French laziness and their long time high unemployment rate. I think most Americans who read this book would get a good laugh from this humor, but I seriously wonder how many French will take this advice seriously? If you can get your hands on a free copy, it's worth at least reading a chapter or two, but I wouldn't spend any money on it."
0," Below-average offering (2.5 stars): The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on ""II"" and ""Up On the Sun"" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit ""Backwater"" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either."
1," A true review of this Book: In general, this book satisfies its purpose as being a math workbook, not lesson book, which provides a large number of SAT-like math questions, partitioned into categories. The book does not teach concepts like the Barron's book, but through doing the questions and reading the explanations you can extract the concepts and the train of thought. The only part where the book is slightly flawed is that some of its questions, towards the end of a question set, titled ""hard,"" really require more thinking than is required on the real exam. However, this can only help your practice, but do not be discouraged if you can only solve some of those!"
0," By far the worst movie that I have ever seen.: The movie had absolutely no point. Never mind buying it, but I regreted renting it. I fastforwared the whole tape. I am a big fan of movies and especially Nicolas Cage's but this was low."

1," Great portable player -- but a little flimsy: This is a great portable cd player -- one of the best I've tested -- but I think that it is a little flimsy. I abuse my electronics, and I like them to be durable. (Read: I drop my nice things quite often.) But the sound quality on this product is top notch -- and the headphones are very very nice. I also like the red rim (also available in blue). The button configuration is easy to use; all of them are in the right places. But I think the best thing about this player is the fact that you can use two different types of batteries! You can insert two AA or two AAA. There are different battery covers provided to accomodate these different configurations. What an awesome feature!I highly recommend this product."
1," Amazing harness!: After reading previous reviews I had high hopes of having better control of my dogs on walks, but was concerned about a rash/wound forming under arm from rubbing friction. So here is my experience...I have 2 very large dogs that pull on walks and as soon as I put the harness on there was an immediate change in them. No pulling at all! I can even walk them with my kids & stroller which I was never able to do. And no rash or rubbing under armpit area. Best product yet!"
0," RIP OFF Alert, Publisher & the Author are Thieves...: WARNING- New Edition came out in Feb.'09...This publisher, and author(more like assembler of other peoples work)adds a few paragraphs every 6 months, and reissues another edition just to extract another ~$100 for a textbook that is a 400 page paperback that is an assemblage of other peoples work. This makes the used value essentially ZERO.Students can't afford to be ripped off by predatory publishers, and authors like this.Shame, Shame Wadsworth Publishing, Cengage Publishing, and Shirley Biagi"

1," BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!: My expectations for the new Wilco album were through the roof before it even came out, and when I finally heard it all of my expectations were completely blown away. Jeff Tweedy and Co. have outdone themselves. If you're a Wilco fan, this album is a must have. If you are not a Wilco fan, one listen and you will be."
0," Neither good science nor good fiction: As in Meg, Alten has taken a heck of a promising villian (Megalodon) and turned it into chum. His science is considerably off, which spoils a lot of the enjoyment for me. We know there is no hydrothermally-warmed layer of water at the bottom of ""The Trench."" If we make the logical assumption that Meg would behave much as modern sharks do, this weird-acting anthropomorphic creature is impossible to accept as a shark. The humans are no better. Simple one-dimensional figures, they stumble through one miraculous surival escapade after another. The only thing Alten gets right is pacing. The plot hums along nicely, and the book is a fast read, but neither the creatures (reptiles evolving gills? If it's possible, why hasn't it happened in 400 million years?) nor the humans hold the reader's interest."
1, Built like a tank: This are made to last. I 4 of these for one cabinet section and they work very well They were also pretty easy to install.
1," Invitation to experience the real Father.: The video is worth the purchase to hear the exchange between the author and a hurting woman on a plane. For 45 min., you'll see and hear real tenderness expressed through a man who understands the Father's heart for each human being. Treat yourself to refreshing Truth."
1," Hauntingly beautiful: We saw this artist in person at the Small Bridge this summer. The live performance was awesome. This CD is as good as it gets without being there. Eoin's music is highly creative and original. It sounds like a blend of ancient and modern, or maybe I should say timeless. I listen to it frequently for a mood adjustment. We'd love to be able to purchase more work by this artist."
0," Piece of Junk - don't waste your money: This is a piece of junk that tries to do what a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer is designed to do. It is cheaply made, and you will waste your money if you buy this juicer. It is not made to last. Under the stress of juicing wheatgrass, it will crack and break. The gears of the handle are molded lexan plastic, and will not last. The handle will break too under load of wheatgrass. You can crank a stainless steel wheatgrass juicer and not have to worry about the handle breaking in half. The stainless steel crushing blade will also crack at the seams after a bit of use. After a dozen uses, it cracked on each seam. Don't listen to the seller by email, they lie. They said it is tough. That is b******. Get a good stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, and it will last."
1," The best ""New Age"" CD I've heard.: I'm a classical music lover who hasn't been impressed very much by most New Age music. Then my wife exposed me to The Fairy Ring and I immediately fell in love with it. I love it so much that I bought two copies -- one for home and one for work. I can't give it a higher recommendation. If you want beautiful music to relax to, you can't do better than this very special CD."
0," David Poque's advice will cost you $100: Mr Poque says that you can not do a ""clean install"" with the Windows XP upgrade. He says that the only way to do a ""clean install"" (the only way to go to avoid trouble) is to purchase the full version of Win XP. This is false. Win XP upgrade works just like all other Win upgrades. When you do a ""clean install"" it will ask you to insert the disk from your previous version and then install WinXP. Buy the upgrade and save your money. There are many other errors, but this is the one that will cost you money.Female readers will be upset with the fact that he always refers to the ""administrator"" as a male and the ""subordinate"" as a female."
0," What the ?!?! were they thinking?: I ordered a few other movies the day I ordered this one,and I forgot to read the customers reviews.BIG MISTAKE!!!

Laughed even through today.Do any of you KNOW how hard it is to A. hold something in your left hand that is larger than your fist, while B. putting a finger in one nostril as you yodel AND roll the die until you get three twos?!?!? All while fits of laughter make your body convulse as your vision gets blurred from all the tears (my dear husband even took a photo to prove it)!The next time we play (which will be soon) we will have more than just four players (although it played well with four, we can't imagine the craziness with more!!!).Thanks Matt, Robb, and Jeremy for this amazing new game!!!!"
1," Infrared works well with Windows ME: Even though it said that the infrared wireless printing only works with Windows 95, I found that it worked just as well with Windows ME installed in my laptop.Two great benefits of the BJ-50: 1. Infrared wireless printing (if your laptop supports it) 2. There is battery in the printer, so you don't have to connect it to an electrical outlet to print! Both features are VERY convenient.Print quality is decent, but I can't comment on ink life since I have just begun to use the printer."
0," Repackaged psychoanalysis: The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds. Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them. Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory. The author says repeatedly that we were ""whole"" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again. Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset. For example, in the section about ""rewriting scripts"" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants. But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child!"
1," Color's fading? It might not be the cartridge: If your printer's color is starting to fade, (especially reds and magentas) and you're thinking the cartridge is running low, it might actually be the printer is dirty internally. Unfortunately, the cleaning process is intricate and not a do-it-yourself task. What's going on is dust has settled on the lenses and mirrors in the laser scanning unit. My sources at HP tell me this is a ""dirty little secret"" with the 1600 and 2600-series printers and that you'll probably need to have it cleaned every 18 to 24 months depending on how dusty your area is.I'm telling you this in a review for toner as this cartridge is used in the affected printers. Five stars for being a high-quality product that's not going to leak toner on you like some off-brand refilled cartrige might."
1," WHAT A COLLECTION!: I have listened to Gino Vannelli ever since I was a kid & this collection was what i have waited years for! The only fault with this cd was that it should have been made into a double cd set. there were other good songs like ""jo-jo"", ""Feel like flying"", ""The evil eye"" & ""Sally(she says the sweetest things)"" just to name a few. But other than that i was satisfied with the cd. Gino & his brothers made the best use of 70's synthesizers & it sounds as good today as it did when first made!"
0," This movie is Doomed ---There is a reason for Editors after all!: Dune was an incredible story and incredible movie -- although albeit only the most diehard fans could follow it on first viewing. Others learned to love this master piece of sci fi done with no holds barred on the excellent filming, acting, directing, and music. Truly David Lynch was masterful. Ok, now let's get to the 'Extended Version' . This was just god-awful, it is obvious why David Lynch refused to have his name associated with the ridiculous mess with added footage and where good footage was replaced with bad. This version could be the basis for an entire course for movie Editors. It clearly makes one appreciate what good editing can do for a film, and how bad editing can destroy it -as it did for this Extended version of Dune. No wonder they had to use a fake director's name like 'Smithe'."

0," TERRIBLE. THEY DESERVE 0 STARS!: I ordered this item on Monday, April 30th. I used two day shipping because I needed it quickly. I have pet green anole lizards, and the mesh screen top to their tank got a tear in it, so I have been forced to temporarily house my pets in a smaller container while I wait for a new top. Two day shipping MY ASS! The item hasn't even shipped yet, and it's friday. I looked up tracking on the order and the estimated delivery date was May 29 through the begging of June!!! What the hell? I will never ever order from this company again, and I will tell everyone I know to avoid them. The product might be great, but I will never know, because these morons couldn't be bothered to ship me my product. This product was NOT OUT OF STOCK. It even had one of those ""Order in the next x amount of hours, and get it by Wednesday"" tags beside it. I am so frustrated that my lizards are suffering and I have to go find a new vendor and wait even longer. What a crappy way to do business."
1," Definitely helpful for beginners but pricey though: A beginner would find the book certainly helpful as the author handholds and takes you for a stroll across the stack and various protocols. However, I'm not convinced that the content given here justifies the price of 62.25 (when I bought it in 2009 the price was $39 and I had some qualms even then). The other option is to fire up Wireshark fiddle around it yourselves. The tools and the info are all out there free for the inquisitive."
0," 100 miles per hour screaming: 100 miles per hour screaming just about sums this one up, its basically a dumbed down death metal album which isnt saying much, their earlier stuff has a lot more too it. It not totally bad though, I liked the last 3 songs on the album, and Cold Murderous Music has a very sweet sound. My suggestiong would be to buy one of their older CDs, unless you like death metal, and hope that they will spend a few years making a good black metal album next."
1," Great stuff: This mouthwash is the best ever. It takes a little more than a few drops to really work, but it is great."
1," Good Bedtime Book: A little boy can't sleep because there is a tiger in his closet who keeps finding new ways to make noise. My girls love this book at bedtime. It is great for kids who are old enough to start seeing humor in books. They laugh at each new antic of the tiger, and I often hear them repeating phrases from the book throughout the day to their stuffed animals (such as, ""Tiger! You are driving me crazy! No more noise!"").The book also provides an opportunity to show kids that they need to be quite at bedtime. And the onomotapoeia gives the kids a chance to ""read along.""The pictures are friendly and, even though they take place in a darkened room at night with a tiger in the closet, are not frightening. The humor helps kids' imaginations turn toward the pleasant rather than the scary when they hear bumps in the night."
0, DO NOT BUY! MALFUNCTIONING POWER SUPPLY!: We loved the product while it worked but recently the power supply died after 1 year 7 months. Of course it's out of warranty and the company won't even respond to questions on how to send it for repair. Look at http://forums.rokulabs.com and you will find many other customers with exactly the same problem. So steer clear from this product and this company.
0, SO NOT RED: I was also disappointed - I think there was a typo somewhere because now when I look it up it shows sienna was the color I thought I was seeing...
0," Female and foul-mouthed in the Army.: I enjoyed this book more for my parallel experience of being a female soldier and linguist than for any real literary merit. Williams has a very jaded, negative view of the Army. For someone who was supposedly ""so educated"", her constant foul language was off-putting. Was she unable to find better words to express herself? What annoyed me most was the narcissistic tone of the whole book. The Army is about ""us"" and ""we"", the squad/platoon/company/etc, not ""I"" and ""me"", the individual.Having seen the comment that someone wished they could have read what she did during those 12-hour shifts, I must add that she had to submit the manuscript for classification review (for security purposes) before being allowed to send it to the publisher."
0, B&D Leaf Collection System: I can not rate this. I recieved only part of it and have had no luck dealing with Amazon to get the missing part.
0," Furious: I have never critiqued a book on Amazon. However, I am so sorely dissappointed by Rushdies latest book, Fury, that I feel obligated to warn Rushdie fans to avoid this book at all costs. If you have respect for his previous works, like I have, than this book will definitely wreck your image of a genious writer with the gift of magical realism. However, if you are interested in hearing an intellectual writer snobbishly gloat for nearly 250 pages about his life then buy it. I have my reservations about American Society as well as he does - but geez to dwell on it for so many pages and then 'cut and paste' people magazine into the novel makes me wonder if he secretely loves to hate the country he loves. To top it all off, this is the most amatuer plot I have read - since I've reread my own writing when I used to think I could write. Don't waste your time."
1," Better Than Most but Lacks Learning Stragegy and Psychology: Barry Farber's classic 'How to Learn Any Language' approaches language learning from the perspective of a person who grew up in a largely monolingual America and went on to learn many languages fluently.Language technology and understanding how the internal workings of the subconscious mind greatly impact future fluency in a language are topics which are largely ignored by Farber.His techniques are solid, his stories are hilarious, but his mental and psychological approach is non-existent.I highly recommend you buy Farber's book, but please do supplement it with eitherThink and Grow Fluent (Secrets of Language Success)orAutomatic Fluency - Nine Steps to Speaking Languages and Finishing Fluent (Secrets of Language Success Series).This excellent ebooks will provide you with the little known secrets of programming your mind for your future fluency."
0," Blah blah blah oh and I'm so tough: Larry Winget is known as The Pitbull of Personal Development and boy does he not let you forget it. He seems to spend more time talking about his confrontational style than he spends giving actual useful advice. Basically you get a couple paragraphs of advice you heard from every other self help nut, then a couple pages about how tough Larry Winget is.If the author was half as tough as he tells you he is he wouldn't have to spend two pages reminding us after every two paragraphs.Take out the author's tough guy shtick, which gets old after the first two pages, and you have yourself a regular old self help book with the same common sense advice.If you're overweight, stop eating so much and exercise.If you're in debt, stop spending so much and don't use any more credit.If your girlfriend dumped you, get over it."

1," A True Conservative: America has come a long way since Reagan and so has the American right. No longer is the mainstream right, the ideology of small government but rather it was been hijacked by neo-cons and ""compassionate conservatives"". This can no longer stand and the true Libertarian-Right, in the mold of Ronald Reagan, must once again take a stand and take back the American right. Bruce Bartlett has started this war with this superb book that shows how Bush, the supposed conservative, has a more liberal policy then Clinton and spat on the 1994 Revolution along the Reagan years."

1," had Sooo much trouble finding it on CD: I'm 29, and for years the only way I could listen to this great album was from my dad's old scratchy LP from 25 years ago. The atmosphere in the version of Battle of NO is unbeatable, great harmony on songs like Mother of Love and Dream are blended so well. And of course, Rippling Waters makes me feel like I'm sitting on the porch of a country store. Great album, if you like Nitty Gritty, you'll love this album."
0," Don't expect a fun page-turner: I am a huge Sex and the City fan and was hoping for a fun, interesting summer read. However, I found myself struggling a bit to finish this book (I actually stopped about halfway through and then finished it later). For the hundreds of pages, there's surprisingly no real plot. It's more of an often-boring look at the characters' lives, not to mention, I really didn't even grow to like any of the characters. I'd agree with others that Janey in particular is shallow, self-absorbed and really somewhat annoying.If you want to read a Candace Bushnell book, I would HIGHLY recommend reading Lipstick Jungle. I've been disappointed with a few of her books but Lipstick Jungle was actually a great one that I couldn't put down. Definitely don't waste your time on Trading Up."
1," Great fit, Great sound: I had tried several other bluetooth earpieces before this one. My major complaint with the others is that they didn't fit into my ear, and hung loosely. I'm over 50, and my hearing isn't what it was 20 yrs ago. This device fits into my ear very comfortably, and the sound quality is very good. I've seen reviews that mention that the power switch on this device is too small. I have very big hands, and don't find the button size to be a problem. I highly recommend this device."
0," Great musicianship, but lacking impact: I have many, many fado CDs in my collection. Although the musicianship displayed in the CD is very good, the emotional delivery of the fado is overshadowed by arrangements that are too complex, effectively preventing the musicians from expressing the feeling that makes the fado a special art form. Cristina Branco's voice is good, but it lacks the despair and anguish found in other fadistas.If you want a display of technical musical ability, this is your CD..."
0," a bit disappointed: Having read the book many times growing up & seen the CBS series, I was a bit disappointed with the movies. While great for loyal Christy fans who're familiar with the characters & the incredible story, I agree with some other reviewers that 'newbie' fans shouldn't start with the movies. The original CBS series was great!!! Although Lauren Lee Smith, Diane Ladd & Sam W. are commendable, I think Kellie Martin's Christy, Tyne Daly's Miss Alice & Randall Batinkoff's David were MUCH MORE believable. At times, the acting came off a bit overly done or not enough & unfortunately, Lauren's Christy struck me as a bit...bland. The saving grace: 3 cheers though for Stewart Finlay-McClennan's returning performance as Dr. MacNeil! Hope this helps: I'd try to get the whole series 1st, and then these movies."
1," As good as it was 50 years ago!: I still say this is the best-written sitcom there ever was. I LOVE the casting, the fact that it's an ensemble piece, that the comedy comes from the situation (situation comedy, duh!). This show makes me laugh over and over and over again. It's a show about sweet people and the things that happen in the course of their lives. It's *that* funny because it could be any of us. I just love it. Oh, and the packaging is the best! Each disk has its own case, so there's no scratching like there could be on a spindle, as some shows are packaged now. It's 5 seasons, 5 disks per season. YES!!!"

0," Huge Disappointment: This camera was a gift, and it was so bad, that I returned it to a store that it wasn't purchased from, and traded for a camera that is ... less but works better. Sony neglected to inform Mac users that this camera doesn't work with Macs. The box says that it is Mac compatible, but upon further review, you see that it is only compatible for Mac if you are trying to download pictures, not video. If that's all I wanted it for, I'd have bought a digital camera. The TRV27 works much better, is more ergonomic, has a bigger LCD screen, and is compatible with most if not all home computers. To the makers of Sony - why come out w/micro mv if there isn't any supporting hardware/software? As far as I'm concerned, the IPB-7T is merely a ... paperweight!!P.S. All of you PC users out there, GO GET A MAC!!!"
1, The Illustrated 1893 Diary of a Trip to the World's Columbian Exposition: The book was a nice quick read and skillfully matched the diary of an 18 year old young man attending the the Expo with his father while displaying photographs of what he was observing. Anyone interested in Chicago or US histoty should enjoy the book.
0," Odd response: I believe that Culler seems to have missed the point here. Clearly, the first Seattle reviewer was referring to Culler's most recent book, from 2003, titled ""Deconstruction: Critical Concepts in Literary and Cultural Studies,"" which he edited."
1," Tickled Pink: When I saw some guy on the train wearing these hideous yet retro-ish headphones, I wanted a pair. But had no idea what they were. When I stumbled upon them again, I purchased them right away. Thanks Amazon.Upon trying them, all the hype on the internet proves true. Deep cello solos to jazz sessions, loud or quite sound phenomenal.What's great is after using cheapo headsets for so long that now when a great bass comes up or a sweet high, I don't hold my breath to listen to the massacre. Now, there's just music."
1," Lusine - Serial Hodgepodge: Abstract and proud, Lusine's SERIAL HODGEPODGE wears its credentials on its sleeve, from the torn-up female vocals and melodic underpinnings on ""Ask You"" to the crispness of ""Slur."" ""Drip"" sounds like a lost Tim Hecker track, however, while ""The Drop"" edges into Akufen-like house rhythms. And, as if just to prove he could do it, he moves to downtempo on the gentle ""Everything Under the Sun."" Though the tracks show sharp production values, they can be sterile at times; for instance, ""Falling In"" is smart and danceable, but also cold. ""Auto Pilot"" is slightly warmer, while ""Figment"" is slightly choppier. The final track, ""Payne's Gray,"" takes a completely abstract route, with a cello cutting in and out. Doubtless, there's an eclectic quality to these tracks, showing a great range of imagination and ability. But a more concrete vision to link the tracks together as an album would also be welcome."
0," Can't win one lap of first race...: Even on the first race at the first level, one wreck and you can't win the first race, which means you can't get any money to fix the truck, which means you have to completely restart. No demo mode, no practice mode. Bad design, bad game, frustrating and getting rid of. More trouble than it's worth. My 9 year old and I both tried and neither could win even one lap of the first race."
1," Breathtaking.: Yes, it's the lady who performed ""Bad Girls"" & ""Hot Stuff"", on this album she reveals to us her Christmas self. The Album is full of that Christmas Spirit and Donna Summer does a great job with the classic ""White Christmas"", ""I'll be Home For Christmas"" & ""O Holy Night"". There are a few new Gems on this album, ""Christmas Is Here"", ""Christmas Spirit"" & the Spellbinding ""Breath Of Heaven"" & ""Lamb Of God"". By listening to ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" you'll tell that she is in great shape; the orchestrations are grand and the Choir spectacular. Recommended."
0," Infuriating rubbish - and I have myself to blame: The book is well criticized in many of the 1-star reviews so I won't repeat the valid points made there but just add to the numbers.I am shocked that I actually bought this book - but there it is in my order history, bought from Amazon in late 2004. My age at the time (28 :-) ) does not justify this choice and I can only hope that it was a ""people who bought this also bought"" inspiration after putting Csikszentmihalyi's ""Flow"" into my cart.On the upside, I don't have any friends or relatives to think less of for giving it to me as a gift. And this teaches me to never ever trust the average ratings on Amazon again but always to check for very low ratings."
1," This one is a keeper: I have enjoyed this DVD many times since my purchase. DVD, price and delivery were all what I expected they would be."
0," A Great Story, written like a first draft by a novice.: I assume that Carlton's editors were not available to ""edit"" as this book is so poorly written and constructed that I gave up half way through (and wanted to much sooner). An example: How many times do we have to hear about how strangely Spindler acts or Sculley's health? Just once if it's only going to be brought up over and over and over and over and over and over (etc.) again like we hadn't just read about it in the last chapter (or page). This is one of the most fascinating corporate stories to tell and unfortunately, Carlton is over his head in the telling. A complete and total waste of time and money. Geez, I hope they don't try and make an $80 million movie out of this turkey. If only Tom Wolfe had done it."
1," A Blend Of Pop-Rock and...Pop: Anyone who has heard both Enema of the State and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket knows TOYPAJ is probably the better of the two. This album is by far not punk but hard pop. It's quite a bit better than EOTS. Songs like ""Stay Together For The Kids"" and ""Anthem Pt.2"" have the more ""rockier"" feel to them while the first single ""Rock Show"" and ""First Date"" have more of a poppy sound. My suggestion is if you like their pop-rock, go for this. If you want a harder Blink then by Dude Ranch (in my opinion it's the best)."
0," Maverick Mistakes in Real Estate Investing: Simply horrible, describes how the author blows hundreds of thousands of dollars."
1, FANTASTIC: Fool for Love is a GREAT read! All of Kayla Perrin's works are excellent but this one is OUTSTANDING!!! A MUST READ!!!!!
0, The audacity of these guys: How greedy do there Jokers have to be. In an economy like this they are still scrounging for everybody's money. I am definitely waiting for extended release.
1," If you liked Anne Frank, you'll love Simone Liebster!: This excellent auto-biography provides a glimpse into the life and trials of a girl and her family who found themselves facing the wrath of Hitler. As members of the Jehovah's Witnesses, they refused to support Hitler's war machine and so the Nazis vowed to exterminate the group. Persecuted for their beliefs, not for their ethnicity, this story tells of Simone's quiet fight for right. Sustained by her hope and faith, she overcame opposition of the strongest kind and has found the strength and courage to share her story. For anyone who loved Anne Frank, this is a must read!"
0," Wrong Adaptor Sent: I was sent a 1/8 to 1/16 (?) adaptor.I had to make an emergency trip to Radio Shack to get the correct adaptor, but Amazon did refund my money."
0," Be prepared for extra work!: I'm not sure if Little Tikes has reduced their quality control measures but this is the second toy we've purchased that didn't assemble properly.Holes were missing from the panels that secure to the back of the shelving units. I had to punch them out with a screw driver in order to assemble the panels. When the phone unit didn't attach correctly, I notified Little Tikes. They said that the problem was common and recommended I increase the size of the holes. It didn't work and we've since tossed the phone and it's cradle. Little Tikes offered to replace the unit but that would have meant another assembly. We chose not to take our chances! Purchase at your own risk!"
1," A contemporary master of the short story: This is a fine introduction to the short fiction of William Trevor, focusing on the most Irish of his stories--and more accessible than his imposing Collected Stories. Trevor has always been a confident writer. His stories have such a logic to them. They seem not have been invented at all. Perhaps this is why they are so affecting. The best stories include ""The Ballroom of Romance,"" the classic ""Theresa's Wedding,"" ""The Paradise Lounge,"" and my two favorites, ""The Piano Tuner's Wife"" and ""Honeymoon in Tramore."" Trevor is a giant of the form."
0," A Ph.D. should know better: Grammar and spelling errors begin on the first page of this disappointing book. Shouldn't a Ph.D. know how to spell ""Gandhi""? (She spells it ""Ghandi."") Shouldn't a highly educated author know better than to put the periods outside the quotation marks?I found the chapters to be simply statements of the obvious: ""Be nice to students,"" ""Be available,"" ""Keep a positive attitude.""Not much of substance here for an aspiring prof."
0," Enough already!!: In my opinion Ms. Mayes is doing for the literary world what Thomas Kincaid has done for art.I was absolutely entranced with Italy after reading UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN.........and equally so with BELLA TUSCANY. I must admit that while I truly enjoyed the photographs contained in IN TUSCANY I was less than satisfied with the written content. I feel that the passion Ms. Mayes felt with her first book, and so openly shared with the readers, has wained with each successive book and she is nothing but commerical at this point.I feel she has allowed celebrity and money to corrupt her art ..... much the same as Mr. Kincaid. So, when will we see the Bramasole tea towels or the Cortona coasters???"
0," Buy a smaller sliding miter saw instead: Purchased this 12"" compound miter saw on the reccomendation of a friend and I regret that now. The saw itself is ok. It is easy to adjust, smooth to use, and has plenty of power to cut framing lumber. However, I find this saw to be WAY too big for my needs. Iyt is big, very heavy, and the base is very deep making it hard to fit on a miter saw stand. Instead I wish I had bought an 8"", or perhaps 10"", compound SLIDING miter saw.I bought the reconditioned saw (no longer available at this time) and after a few weeks, mind has developed a bad crack in the cast aluminum base. I haven't fingiured out what I am going to do with that yet - presumably bring it to dewalt for repair. In any case, I would not buy this saw again."
0," Poor design disappoints: My 9-year-old son got this for Christmas. The simple stuff is easy to make using small gears lying flat. We tinkered together for a while to make some of the complex systems displayed on the box, but frankly, they are impossible to make. I believe another reviewer for a version of this toy said that it would require adults using superglue to hold pieces together to make the cool stuff. I agree. The pieces do not fit together in a predictable or stable way to allow gears to turn as you build a tower (well all but the simplest tower with the small gears). I'd build a tower only to have it not work, or have it fall apart because the gears would only mesh if the pieces were not firmly fit together. The brief instructions don't help. The instructions crucially lack drawings of sample set ups. My son gave up after 15 minutes and I did a half hour later."
1," Nice Mix of Ab Work: This DVD is a nice mix of Pilates styled ""core"" workouts and 5 minute straight forward ab workouts. The Pilates sections are mostly 10-20 minute routines with each one focusing on different areas. There's also a sort of bonus section called More for Your Core that has a half hour Pilates and stretching workout and some 15-20 minute routines that use a Pilates ring, hand weights and a stability ball."
1," Good book: just revisited this book after having read it 20 years (or more) ago, in the original. It is very eye opening. When I first read it at the tender age of 24, I diagnosed myself as hyperinsulinistic, and got off the sugar. That's not an easy trick, considering the culture of family around me that did everything in her power (Mom, who else?) to sabotage my new diet, and play manipulation to make me feel bad for not sharing in the addiction she raised me on. Now, she's 80, and freshly diagnosed diabetic, and refuses to go on Dr's drugs (made her feel bad), so this book is now going to her. It's all related, it's not a separate thing. Also new is high fructose corn syrup, came out after the book, so is not mentioned. Google fructose rats for some eye openers on the creation of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, congestive heart failure, cushing's syndrome and other irritations caused by fructose."
1," Nice to have: I bought this when I was 6 weeks along. I'm a scrapbooker, so I really wanted to do a scrapbook journal of my pregnancy, but I'm just so busy (last semester of college) that I was worried I wouldn't keep up with it. It's fun because you can write a little something every week- whatever you want- and you're not stuck commentating on specifics weekly. Some of the pages and prompt throughout the first trimester so far have not applied to me, but it's not a big deal. You can always tear unused pages out. I was a little disappointed in the cover's material (it would scratch easily, IMO), and it was a little smaller than I was envisioning, but I still love it. I keep it by my bed and write in it weekly. Overall, a cute book to journal your pregnancy experience =]"
0," The Good, the bad, and the really ugly: The material in the book is pretty straight forward. It introduces you to Autocad 2005 and walks you through the procedures pretty good. As far as I got! That's the good. The bad was because I got the ebook version I had to keep jumping back and forth between Adobe Acrobat Reader and Autocad when I had questions. Now the UGLY!! If your computer crashes. You've lost your book. Or at least the security key to read it. The book is still on my D drive, but apearently the security key to view it was stored somewhere on C drive, which crashed, and it is now gone, and the ebook is worthless. And by the way, don't think about printing it out. It's well over 700 pages and the security key only allows 30 pages to print a month. Lets see; how many years is that.....?"
1," TERRIFIC!: I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON IN LAW- HE HAD IT IN HIS CAR WITHIN MINUTES OF OPENING THE PACKAGE, HE LOVES IT!"
0," Bogus book: Bogus book written by someone who has never seen the Eddie Eagle program. If you see a gun...Stop! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult! That is the Eddie Eagle message. Over and over again. Books like this are a lie, written to promote a gun control/anti-gun message, and to malign the NRA. Go NRA!!!!"
0," A guide to Freelance Prostitution: I get that this was meant to be a DC version of ""Sex and the City"", but it was far from it. Jessica Cutler was an aimless slut/prostiute...literally. I am not saying that to be mean it was just what she was. She had no purpose or personality. In fact her main objective seemed to be to have sex with six different partners in exchange for drugs and cash or just to find away to pass the evening. She constantly used drugs and exchanged sex for drugs, money, and an apartment. But, throughout she maintained this unfounded sense of superiority for whatever reason...and this annoyed the heck out of me. This book should be called ""How to be a freelance prostitute""!"
1," Great for the absolute beginer!: Just recieved the book yesterday and had a chance to read the first couple of sections. The book is clear, and does not set up unrealistic expectations of how the learning process will go. Although I already know how to read music, the book does explain very well how to get started with reading as well as the acctual playing of the instrument. I would certainly recomend this book to a beginer, but if you already play, skip to something a little more advanced."
0," Vibrates like a jackhammer.: I bought this product because it was made in the USA. And because of that especially I really wanted to like it. I bought this as a second shaver to keep at work. It does not do any better of a job than my Norelco at home, which is not saying much. But the real issue I have with it is that its vibration level is VERY pronounced. Its not really comfortable to use for a full shave.The shaver comes was a seperate small battery operated trimmer. That trimmer actually works great, especially for running off a AA battery. But I bought this thing for the shaver and its just not that good at all."
0, Implausible!: This book has so many errors in it that you don't have to be a military Historian to find it laughable. The books Conservative President is a lesson in moral hypocrisy. The hero has no redeeming qualities. Fortunately I listened to it on tape. I had to listen to whole tape because I couldn't believe how bad it really was.This book rates one Star because you cannot award zero stars.
1," BSA Sweet .22 3-9X40mm scope: This scope really looks good and if it performs as advertised it will be a good addition to anyone`s armory. I have mounted it on a early 60`s SEAR`s (Marlin) .22 MAG rifle, bore sighted it but have not fired it as of yet due to bad weather and that is the reason for the 4 star. As soon as I began to use it I will update this review."
1," A Much Needed Flush: The quality is excellent, the need was dire. My only bathroom was inaccessible for a week due to renovations. Not much choice but to purchase this ""THING"" according to my wife. This ""THING"" saved the day. The engineering that went into the design was impeckable. My wife might never use it again; it is a useful thing to have at the ready, never know what the future holds."
0, No fun for any age: This is the worst toy that my son received for his 5th birthday. Making a basket is nearly impossible for me or him. There is no scoring mechanism. This toy is going in the garbage.
0, Piece of crap!!: I usually enjoy his movies but this is unwatchable. I wish I had the minutes back that I wasted on it.
0," As Hollywood Inside Info Goes ...: I love Hollywood gossip books. This was the biggest waste of paper ever (and mind you, without the added highlighted quotes taking up most of the page ...) Really no inside scoop on anyone or anything, much less the author himself. A series of ""aren't I cute"" quotes that made me feel quite empty at the end. One of the most shallow people I have ever read about, used to like his appearances, now he makes my skin crawl."
0," Reads Like It's Written by a 15-yr. Old: I wasn't crazy about his last book, either. But the author has some good story ideas, so I figured I'd try him one more time. Mistake. He writes as if he is 15 yrs. old. No sophistication whatsoever in his writing style or --the bigger sin--in his characters. I find it hard to imagine any adult in the situations he writes about or acting/reacting as he portrays them. The story idea was good enough to keep me reading the entire book, but that's all I can say for it."
0, none: I didn't like the move as well as the other Buddie movies. It may be a little scary for younger children.
1," Neat Receipts: Very handy & space-friendly gadget. I travel all over & pile up receipts for my monthly expense reports. Small enough to take with you so you can keep up with the reports rather than doing them once @ the end of the month. Be sure you do regular backups --it's a bit slow loading up & if you have a lot going on (connected to your network, running Outlook, etc) it may crash. I did lose a month of scanned receipts due to lock up (thanks, WIndows). Works best when no other programs are running. Rather than sending all the original receipts back to corporate, I sent the Neat Receipts reports & PDF copies instead. For Business Cards, I actually like it more than the Card Scan I have."
0, Disappointed: The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.Thanks.Jeanne
0," If this is the ONLY book in the bookstore... OK...: It was a disappointment for me. After all the reviews I had read and everything I had come to expect from this book, it let me down. It was a book that I couldnt leave until I finished it, but it was WAY too long! It took me longer than many other books I've read to finish it. It is not enjoyable. If anything it is a depressing story. The main character Dolores lives through so much catastrophe that by the end of the book you start saying ""oh, no not a-gain!..."" It was interesting only in the respect that it was written by a male writer.In short, if you are left to choose... this shouldn't be the one you pick... If you don't have a choice and you have a lot of time on your hands.. well then ok... you should read it."
0," Replace DM1 module after 18 months: Purchased for Christmas, 2002. Excellent picture. No troubleuntil June, 2004. Heard a ""popping"" sound and the on screen menuwent berserk. DM1 module needs to be replaced. Cost: $1500.00Fortunately, we purchased an extended warranty. They havedecided to replace the TV with one of equal quality plus aseparate HD Directv Receiver. Do not purchase this unit unless you have money to throw away or you like to gamble. Also, wehad to travel a long distance to take the unit to a service center who would EVEN begin to check and repair the set."
1," buy it!: I have had the 7004awbr with their wireless PC card for 3 months now. It was *very* easy to set up and works great. I ran it with winNT on my desktop and win98 on my laptop, and now have win2000 on both desktop and laptop. The desktop is connected by cable and the laptop wireless. I have nothing but good things to say about it. Fast connection downstairs, out in my backyard. Print server works great. I even recently went to my brother's house, he has a linksys wireless router, and my SMC pc card let me on his wireles network NO PROBLEM.I bought it for ~160 and the PC card for ~80. Great deal on a product that works as advertised w/ no hicups."
0," Cheap imitation of Amanda Bynes: This movie is based on a show on the Disney Channel, called The Lizzie McGuire Show. It is clearly a cheap imitation of The Amanda Show, a show that aired soon before The Lizzie McGuire show did. The Amanda Show stars Amanda Bynes, and actress with talent. Hilary Duff (who plays Lizzie) has absolutely no talent whatsoever, and is constantly trying to be as good as Amanda Bynes--BUT SHE NEVER WILL BE!!!Amanda Bynes then started to star in movies. In 2002 she starred in Big Fat Liar, and in 2003 she starred in What a Girl Wants. Isn't it very cooincidental that soon after these movies came out, this crap-ola movie came out? I suggest that customers avoid this title, and buy something better from amazon.com.Well, finally the Disney Channel fired Hilary (Hilary actually expected to be paid as much as a real star LOL). They'll show reruns, but for now, Hilary Duff is out of the Limelight. There will also be no sequel to this movie. (YES!!!!)"
0," awful awful movie: Lousy dialogue, lousy chemistry, no humour, ridiculous situations. Nice special effects, and Brandon's performance is actually good. But it seems like the screenwriters had no feel for any of the characters, there is very little mystery, and no real surprises. You feel like they just wanted to walk some cardboard cutouts of Superman, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor through dangerous situations without worrying about how they would really feel and react."
0," Where is her editor?: The plot of Hill Towns could have been developed into an enjoyable novel, but Ms. Siddons style has come to overshadow her story. The vast majority of her sentences include a cloying and overblown simile or metaphor and sound like they were written for a creative writing assignment titled ""Write a story using as many simles and metaphors as you possibly can"". Where is the editor of this book? Isn't it his/her job to weed the material?"
0," Doesn't Work!: Package arrived. Everything looked very flimsy - the packaging and the product.In this case, appearances are not deceiving. All very 'plasticky.'Once programmed, the time appeared on the display. THE END. That is, it's the end of this product's performance. A guy with a Master's Degree in Computer Science also read the whole tech manual and attempted to make it work: NO JOY."
0," Waste of time: There are plenty of more interesting people to read about. No mention is made that during the time of Bell's travels through Turkey the Armenians were being wiped out by the Turks. I found her to be pretentious and a spoiled girl who turned to daddy every time she ran out of money and wanted to be back in her ""beloved"" desert. If she was so wonderful at politics, how come those areas of the world are still at war?"
0, Quite technical: The book is very technical in nature that is geared more toward health care professionals rather than general readership. There are portions of the book that are informative for those with Lupus and their families. I would not recommend reading this book prior to reading several others that are geared to the Lupus patient and their family.
1," Love Channelock NutBusters: Every man should own at least one pair of Channellock Nut Busters. These are a good value for the price, and they have saved my bacon at least once, which makes them worth the cost of entry. The uniquely shaped bill enables greater grip on a nut than a regular set of pliers or Channellocks, making it easy to break loose. I will be purchasing the larger and smaller set of Nut Busters very soon, to make a complete set. Highly recommended."
1," Emotional reading on teen suicide: The plot kept me going, although it was a challenging read. It was a believable story about young love and the crazy way that teens think about life and death."
0," Who is Jimmy Breslin's editor?: This book is filled with errors--dates, spelling, grammar, names, etc. How can a Pulitizer Prize winning author attach his name to such poor writing? Breslin had such an important topic to write about. He let the victims down in his attempt to bring down the Church."
1," MYSTERY: This is only the second book I have read in this series. I found that it dragged in some areas and the story was hard to follow. I will see I can get the movie. I have seen the TV shows that were done about 10 years ago, and enjoy ed them.I"
0, sucks: The grommet on the sling would not fit through the buckle on my Universal. I cannot recommend it. Useless to me.

0," Overrated: You'll like this CD if you are a young woman or girlthat wishes that men would stop behaving like men andbe more sensitive. Or if you don't listen to music thatsnot played on your favorite top 40 station. Or if you area gay man.Otherwise, its just not worth it. Slow, boring, musically uninteresting with silly lyrics that make a grown man wantto gag.But I don't like Dave Matthews either, so don't be surprisedthat I don't like John Mayer"
1," Tribute to LDS scholar/leader: This is one of the best biographies I have read in years. Bios can be hard to write (or read) because covering a whole life is not easy to do. I think Boyd Petersen does a great job here. Every other chapter is devoted to teachings of Hugh Nibley. This provides a great balance to the story since teachings make up such a big part of Hugh Nibley's life. Hugh Nibley has lived a most fascinating life. I would rank this right up there with great biographies of the prophets (such as Ezra T. Benson, Gordon B. Hinckley and Spencer W. Kimball). I can't quite get through all of Nibley's most scholarly work, but I appreciate much of what he has given to the LDS community, the best book being ""Approaching Zion"". Read the biography - and if you read any book of Hugh Nibley's, read ""Approaching Zion""."
1," An Amalgam of Folklore and Fiction: This book is great! Not only does it relay Vampires in folklore and legend, but it also gives information on Vampires in literature and fiction. Good for the basics and some deeper things, but it's a shame that it went out of print. The book needs to be released in a second edition, with updated materials and information. All in all, this is a fantastic nonfiction Vampire book, and I would heartily recommend it to all hardcore Vampirologists, scholars, and diehard Vampire fans."
1," Easy set up, works great!: If you already have a firewall on your modem and just need to connect more computers to your modem, this is a better solution than using a router. I just plugged all my wires into it, restarted my modem and it worked immediately with no problems. I've had it hooked up for a few weeks and there hasn't been any glitches.The only thing I didn't like is that there are no holes or brackets for mounting it. For some reason the manufacturer made it so it has to sit on a desk or shelf. However, they did design the case well so it looks nice. Its just that you have to have all your cables running to this thing sitting on your desk."
1," Breathtaking beauty: Krystian Zimerman is one the very few truly exceptional geniuses that can make the piano sing. His colors and tones are of a breathtaking aesthetic beauty as only a Rubinstein or Horowitz were able to produce... French composers appear most suited for him, just look at his Preludes from Debussy. If you love piano, by all means get this CD."
0," panasonic rechargable wet/dry shaver: I have to shave everyday because of the hair on my legs and this did not do the trick. It took a long time and the very next morning I had stubble. It worked great on my bickini area, but sadly was lacking on my legs."
0," Not Worth Renting or Buying: I have the original Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer that was produced by Rakin-Bass. They did the puppet version which was cute, had a great story line and nice music. I watch it every Christmas. This movie which is a continuation is just terrible. I didn't like the story behind it and it lost my interest. It just didn't seem like it would be for little kids. It just lost something being computer generated. The only thing I liked about it was the Snowman. I also didn't like the idea of they had for one character wanting to change their looks. That is not what we want our children hear that if they don't like what they look like they can go somewhere to change it. They also had to many songs that were just corny. In my opinion stick with the original version of Rudolph by Rankin-Bass."
1, Love it!: It's Oprah! What else can I say? You get to see Oprah at her best...which is all the time anyway...LOLI simply love the DVD's!
0," very dissapointed: Read all the information and it stated that it would fit the 6 quart stand mixer. All lies. Not wide enough,looks like a shirt that is too tight. Not long enough, looks like my mixer is wearing flood pants on my kitchen counter. They really need to change the information or make one that does fit this mixer. Thank goodness I can sew. I made my own."
0," I'm disappointed.: I waited anxiously for this book to be released because the Last Boleyn Girl was such a great read. However, this novel reads like a souped up Harlequin romance. Truly, the dialogue kind of ""irks"" me... I mean, ""dear heart, this and dear heart"" that... I wish that someone else would write a review so I can see if I'm the only one that thinks this book was a waste of my money."
0, Have bought two of them and they both broke.: Bought two and they both broke. It was the cheap plastic dish. They crack for no reason and we barely used the soap dishes. Broke within weeks of having them.
1," 19th C. Girl Power!: An amazing percent of my college class, now approaching our 50th Reunion, had read this book as children and loved it. I've recently reread it and found it still terrific. Its subject is a young French orphan girl, stranded without resources other than her own creativity, hard work and moral sensibilities. She makes do and becomes a shining example to everyone. She wins over a stubborn grandfather who has rejected her parents without knowing that the heroine of the book is his only grandchild. Her ability to work with many kinds of people, and to make a life for herself despite enormous difficulties speaks to many girls today. The plot may be a little dated, but the language is vivid, the plot full of action, and the heroine memorable!"
0, not worth it: Bought this looking for a basic CD/radio player and got a piece of junk. The CD player didn't even work the first time we tried it and was hard and costly to try to return. Don't waste your money on this
0," Terrible: Unless you are a completist on the vampire chronicles, as I am, skip this book. It is awful. What is the dill-lee-yo with the change in Marius between the two books. I hope in a later book we find Aramond insane so this book could possiably NOT be part of continuity."
0," 4X4 posi lok DO NOT BUY: I bought a 4X4 Posi Lok for my low mileage Suburban. The stock actuator failed at the worst time possible. The OEM components were a little more expensive, so a reliable mechanical setup seemed like a good idea. Wrong. I recieved the correct kit that was missing parts. I called the manufacturer, whose rep was friendly the first time, but after not recieving anything for two weeks, I called again and he became surly and informed me he'd probably sent the parts, but that may have been the other guy that needed components to complete his kit! My vehicle was out of service over a month, whereas OEM components could have been installed in a few hours.Do not waste your time and money on 4X4 Posi Lok, go to the dealer and get the right parts the first time."
0, $76.08???: $76.08??? Seriously??? I love Ms. Nicks... but $76.08??? I couldn't possibly afford it.Just who is being so greedy here?
1," Does what they claim! Great little jig!: Well this is the first dovetail jig I have owned.After setting it up and doing some playing on some scraps to figure out how to work the thing I must say I was very pleased to turn out some great joints first try!The cam locks work great, the depth adjustments are way cool!My only gripe is the manual SUCKS! It is way too vague for someone who has never used a dovetail jig before. I mean sure I figured it out but the manual was kinda a fill in the blanks puzzle. It took some messing around to figure out what in the world it was trying to tell me. After you get passed that it is a great item! It is really too bad that Porter Cable did not take more time with the manual and make it so dumb guys like me could figure it out a little easier!The only other thing that is kinda a negative is the bits, I have so far not found any in my area and have not found that many online either, but I am sure as time passes they will show up."
1," A bit of a mish mash for Lear's new album: Amanda Lear's first album in the 90's to receive international distribution as opposed to European, is a bit of a mish mash comprising of alternate versions of songs from her ALTER EGO album, and reworkings and remixes of some of her hits from the late 70's most of which are available in their original (and much better) form on other collections. A bit of a missed opportunity as Lear still has her trademark witty and clever lyrics as is evident on Alter Ego and Cadaver Exquis her two major albums from the 90's. The extra star is for the new version of These Boots are made for walking - a killer dance track"
0," Not So Much on Retirement: This may be considered a good book if you're interested in reading the memoirs of intellectuals and former activists. I was looking for practical advice on preparation for retirement. Instead, this book is filled with a bunch of women reflecting on their yuppie, professional lives and personal histories. Most of the women drone on with self-indulgent, narcissistic drivel. There are a couple of interesting stories (like that of Ms. Carol A. Scott) and in between some of the blather there are some startling statistics and interesting facts. But overall, this book has very little sensible advice on retirement, and I feel I've wasted my money."
0," Get even, get this book at the library read it for free.: This book does nothing to advance the wheel of time story whatsoever. But don't take my word for it... read it yourself, go to the library and check it out, read it and then take it back. In this way you in some small way get even with Jordan, his editor and his publisher for the low quality of the last few novels. You get to read them, and they don't get a penny."
1," The Best of Dancercize: I love this Brazilian exercise DVD because of the enthusiasticpersonality of Vanessa Isaac. She conducts the class asif she has known you forever and you're really right therein her class. Also,the class is outside in a beautifulenvironment. I just wish I lived in Santa Barbara so Icould be there in person. Hope she makes anotherDVD."

1," Lacey and Crew We Love You!: I met Lacey during a Clan Of Xymox show in Austin many years back. She was strikingly demure and friendly. After a few conversations she was obviously serious about her work and her stage presence was intoxicating. The whole show was provocative and intense. Ever since I've been a true fan, going to shows and helping promote. The band has opened for and toured with many of the greats including Ohgr, NIN, Thrill Kill Kult and Pigface! This release assured them a major seat in the underground music scene. Measure it by it's dark sexuality and the quiet brooding urge to break out of your freakin' skin! Dangerous, sinuous, and downright stunning! It's quite unfortunate that labels are placed on bands as it is an unworthy form of insulting. Nocturne in my opinion show true conviction in their craft and will continue to pride themselves in the music and the adoring fans that follow them forever. Nocturne.cc"
0, suction doesn't last long: The suction cup on this bowl doesn't work on the SVAN high chair plastic tray. My son threw the bowl and the Cheerios in it all over the floor the first time he used it.
0," This thing stinks!!!!: I just bought this yesterday. I went out and bought lemons, oranges, and limes today to try it out. The lemons juiced fine; without any problem. BUT, then I got to the oranges. The juicer would just stall out every time my husband or I exerted the slightest pressure onto this thing. I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow. I'm certainly not keeping it just to use it for juicing lemons, especially for $30. Cuisinart, didn't you fully test this thing out before throwing it out to the public?"
1," Selfishness, greed and lust vs. a bad marriage.: This is the only Nabokov novel I have read, but it sticks in my mind as sensual and tragic... definitely reminiscent of Shakespeare.""The Graduate"" also comes to mind.Nabokov's descriptive detail puts the reader into the rented room of the nephew, where the first sexual encounter takes place. He doesn't romanticize - he tells everything exactly like it ""is"" & makes it extremely real.Very suspenseful at the end, although I see the description on this site reveals the entire ending, so it ruins it for any potential readers!So don't read that, just read the book. It evoked strong emotion in me, suffering with the characters' situations, frustrations, and desires."
1," Certainly not one star!: I have to admit- I usually love History Channel documentaries, which is what this item is. Not Frank Miller's movie300 (DVD)based on the graphic novel of the same name,300 (Novel). Click on the links to see what I'm talking about. I learned more in this documentary than I had previously thought I would; it shows like a movie, very interesting graphics and effects, and I am pleased as punch with my purchase."
1," Good taste, easy mixing: This product mixed very easily and has a pretty good taste (like Ovaltine). I use it before and after my workouts and find it to be far superior to the Isopure powder I was previously using. Also, being lactose-intolerant, this lactose-free formula is great. I have noticed no bloating afterwards."
1," Purchased as a Christmas Gift: I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law and she is enjoying it very much. She had become a fan of the TV show but missed out on the first and second seasons, so now she is catching up."
1, December#6: I liked reading the book the very hungry caterpillar agian because it shows the changes in the life of a caterpillar and I thnk it teaches little kids to learn foods and help them learn their foods you could like go to a page and ask them the food and they will hopefully learn it. I also think it shows little kids that people also go through changes in life. And reading this book again now that I'm 15 it just now showed me that. And hopefully kids will learn that at an earlier age.
0," A disappointing book: This book is banned in Lebanon. However, I took the risk and paid seven times the price to get a photocopied version. Apart from the terrible grammar and syntax, the book is full of contradicting dates and alleged facts. Many of the tales can never be verified, and the author's credibility does not exist in the first place. For someone looking for evidence and real confessions, I think this book will only be a source of confusion and disappointment. But for someone who is looking for sexual adventures of society figures, things will be different. The only thing that troubled me was that I paid a lot of money on a book that did not deserve all the trouble, risk and excitement."
1," Finally - A fair depiction of ancient Iran: Iran (known as ""Persia"" until 1932) is the only country where practically all surviving sources of it's pre-islamic history are those written by it's enemies (Greeks and Arabs). It is only over the later part of the 20th century that the glorious history of this ""first true empire on planet Earth"" is being re-visited in a more fair and even handed way. This book is a milestone in understanding the history of ancient Iran and, to a large degree, the mindset of the conteporary Iranian."
1," HOW TO BE CONVINCED ABOUT FASTING: I'VE READ LOTS OF BOOKS RECOMMENDING FASTING BUT NEVER A WORD ABOUT THE REAL EFFECTS IN YOUR BODY, APART FROM LOSING SOME EXTRA POUNDS. THIS BOOK OFFERS A VERY DOCUMENTED REPORT."
1," Good flick but can get annoying: I have to say that the Blair Witch Project is one of my all time favorite movies and when I saw that this was out I thought to myself ""why not get it and check it out"" and I can say that I am glad that I did. If you like the kind of movie that has nothing but T&A all the way through it then get this movie, don't get it thinking it is a masterpiece cause it is not and the only part that I hated was the one girl in it that all she does is talk and whine about going skinny dipping, not that there is anything wrong with that but it does get a little annoying. So if you are looking for a fun movie with good looking women and lots of T&A then pick this one up, you won't regret it."
0, worthless: dont waste your money on this one. The gauge is just a cosmetic appendage. Its just crappy.
0," This was horrible: I usually love the Bathroom Readers. This is a tiny useless book, and should not even get to carry the Bathroom Reader name. It was a complete waste of money, for the same price on Amazon do yourself a favor and get the regular size book."
0," feeder falls apart...be warned!: I didn't buy our mesh feeder from here, but did want to write a review somewhere to warn other parents. The pin in the hinge falls out after a few months of use, at least. I kept trying to jam it back in and it kept falling apart as our child used it. I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard. Be warned to not buy this particular feeder. I am trying to find the company's website to write to them about the issues. Our son loved using the feeder so I am going to find another brand that is safer."
0," Picninc at Hanging Rock -Fact or Fiction: I read this book and was fasinated. I saw the movie and wondered why they left out the final correspondence which seemed to be pivital to the death of the head mistress. After further investigation, even though the forward leads you to beleive that this was a real incident, this did not happen nor did anything like this happen. Even the begining of the movie suggests that this book was based on real events. Sort of disappointing. However it is a quick and worthwhile read."
1," Pretty Good for a First Try: This isn't too bad--I think most of these people just hate Kevin and therefore hate his music. They should hate Brittany--she made him what he is. I hope he gets half--he deserves it for what has happened to him. The fickle woman has tired of him and is ready for a new amusement. He sure got blind-sided! I just hope he doesn't kill himself, the poor bastard. Then maybe all you cruel people, who don't really know him, would be happy."
0," Very cute, but not a good value.....: I ordered this a couple of weeks ago as a gift for my mother. I ended up returning it the same day I received it. I was dissapointed in the way the product was presented. True, the charms come in a cute little velvet-like pouch, but the product itself comes in a small plastic bag stapled to a cardboard back. For the price, and because I was giving it as a gift, I thought it should be presented a little better. (How about a nice box with the bag in the middle and the charms displayed on the side?) The price has dropped since I ordered/returned this item, but I still think it would need to drop a little more to make this item a good value. The concept is great, the charms are cute and they're useful for parties, but if you're looking for a nice gift, you may want to look at something else. I guess there really is something to be said for presentation...."
1," Extraordinary: Disch is probably the most underappreciated science-fiction author in the world. His novels have a power and a scope which is almost impossible to find in science-fiction. In England, apparently, he is condsidered to be one of the U.S.'s finest poets, as well as one of our best SF writers (kind of a strange combination, huh?). In Camp Concentration, Disch shows us insights into the world of Louis Sachetti. Torn by disease, posessed by brilliance, this is a character never before seen in science fiction. Brilliant new ideas, engrossing style, extraordinary characters, and one heck of a plot make this novel what it is. Extraordinary. Pringle said it was one of the 100 best of all time. Samuel R. Delany said it was one of the 3 best speculative novels of the 1960's. I'd say its the best to come out of the 60's, and I've read my fair share of New Wave SF (Aldiss, Ballard, Zelazny, Delany, etc.) I'd put it at number 3 all-time, behind The Stars My Destination and Mo! re than Human."
0, Worthless: I bought this DVD to remove a channel logo that had burned into my plasma TV. The disc was a complete waste of time and money and made no difference whatsoever!
1," Best small stand you can buy: This is no doubt the best small stand sold out there for under $100 and it cost no where near that! Very heavy tripod base so it's easier to position close in than round base models and it didn't tip even with a heavy mic fully extended. Impressed by the Samson quality. We have several used on our kick drum, snare drum, and guitar cab mics for live gigs. There are also several in my studio under constant use. Love this product!!!"
0," Useless: I was glad to see that there is a free thesaurus for Kindle. But after I downloaded it, I realized why it's free. It's a bunch of jumbled up words and is horribly formatted, and there's no way to search for anything. It's useless."
0," ...She has way better: I liked ""Case Of The Ex"" and loved ""Ghetto Supastar"" and ""Take Me There,"" so I figured why not check out her debut? I was very disappointed, the whole thing is really slow and uninspired R&B. Mya is at her best in her duets with other people (see ""Ghetto Supastar,"" ""Take Me There"" and ""Lady Marmalade""). Her two solo albums after this are alright, but this is painfully boring."
1," kept me guessing ...: ... the whole time I was watching the movie. Very witty dialogue and scenes; flawless acting by lead and supporting actors. The viewer never knows until the end if Cary Grant's character is a thief or something else. The only shortcoming is that this DVD didn't have subtitles.I caught a few scenes of this movie on TV, but I didn't know what its title was. So I searched Amazon for a movie starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. :-) This is a worthwhile purchase."
0," Expensive and hard to use: This product is far more expensive than just buying fresh eggs and throwing away the yolk. They are hard to mix well, which makes them unsuitable for direct cooking, as in an omlette, or in situations where the whites must be well beaten before using.In addition, the extremely ""fluffy"" nature of the powder as it is packed makes it very difficult to measure properly. Do you measure it packed or loose? The extreme imprecision of the lousy volume-based directions makes it a tough sell for tricky baked goods, like airy cakes.There are other egg white powders out there that do a far better job for far less money."
0," Why is 3LW trying to comeback with a little kids group?: Why is 3LW trying to comeback when they was'nt that good when they were ""three little women"". I mean they was okay but why stick with a kids movie called the Cheetah Girls and then make it a official disney group. I like the song ""Cheetah-licious Christmas"" because it is like, R&B; mixed with Christmas Fun. But can you all just stick to acting!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S The reason I gave it 2 stars because I liked that song ""Cheetah-licious Christmas"" but if I never listened to that song, I would give them 1 star."
1, Awesome: Best war movie i have ever seen. Full Metal Jacket was my best. but this blows it away.shawn
1," Exquisite Cuisine: The title 'Bonnie's Kitchen' doesn't say it, but this is pretty much a best of collection. And Bonnie is one hell of a chef!This compilation album is great for those who aren't sure if they would like her albums or not. 'Bonnie's Kitchen' has all her hits and best tracks from her 3rd album 'Evil and Flowers' and some extra tracks not available on albums of hers.With beautiful lyrics (many of which are in English), some of the funkiest alternative/rock around, and some beautiful piano pieces all carried scrumptiously by Bonnie's voice, this compilation album is a must for anyone who is interested in (or already loves) Bonnie.In a country of cheesy and sugary pop, whatever Bonnie is cookin' is the best kind of unique."
0," Cumbersome and difficult to use: I've had this printer/scanner for over two years now. I would not recommend it. The scanner is difficult to use. You cannot just scan a photo into your computer. You need to insert a memory card into the unit, scan, save it to the memory card, and upload the photo to your computer that way. It takes forever and sometimes the unit doesn't recognize the memory card. No memory card, no scan. My Epson was so much easier to use."
1," I'm a woman and I order this for me!: Over a decade ago, I dated a guy who subscribed to this magazine. I got hooked! The writing is SO funny, and it's chock full of great information for health and fitness.It's kind of like ""The Man Show"" on paper...Now I'm a personal fitness trainer, and often refer back to the various issues for new or different ideas. There are good ideas for mixing up your workout, for eating nutritionally, and motivation.Check it out...Amazon often has killer deals on this subscription. I know there is a version of ""Women's Health"", too, but it's a little watered down for me. But a word of warning: Wear your thick skin if you're a female reading this--don't be easily offended or worked up by all of the humor :) It's not written for us, but to appeal to the testosterone-driven funny bone. ;)"
0, too large ear buds: Unless you have large ear openings do not buy this product. It does not fit and if on the ear it falls off while running. Small in ear bud is best option
0, Disapppointed: I was so happy when I found this watch online ... but I am extremely disappointed now that I've had it for a month. The silver tone bracelet is already becoming tarnished ... and the silver tone is turning orange on the links of the wristband. Even the clasp has turned dull and almost looks like it has a line of orange through it as well. I wish I would have known how quickly this watch would look like crap.I guess you buy cheap you get cheap.
0, terrible quality: Some of the disc in this package will not play at all. Others play but the picture is not clear. I tried cleaning the disc but this did not help. I also tried other disc in my player to assure that it was not my player and they played fine.
0," The Exhibitionist: I did not understand the need or marketing ploy to have Rodney Yee clad in trunks that were so tight that you could clearly see the outline of his private parts! What an exhibitionist! The routines were boring, too."
1, Great movie with a fantastic cast of comedians.: This will always be the best all star cast comedy. Fun watching the scenes filmed in Santa Monica by the pier.
0," Only superficial: Although I have not completed the book I've gotten to the first 7 chapters and I have not found it that enlightening. Most of the referenced shops are old and out of date. The depth of discussion is common sense at best. For example there is a chapter devoted to dust collection but no information on how to determine which size of collector is needed. Nothing on ducting size, determining static pressure loss, length of run, grounding techniques, etc. All very important in deciding how big a collector to buy and how to install. Yet the title implies it is a how to guide. Again very superficial on most topics covered. No guidance is supplied."
1," Rosemary Clooney at Best: If you love Rosemary Clooney like I do, you have to have this Christmas CD to brighten your holiday home with loads of cheer. One of the best rendetions of White Christmas I have heard."
1," Big ideas, small appetite: This book is great for those of us with grandious ideas of canning, but little time, little kitchen, little household. Some unique recipes. Only wish there were a few more of teh old ""standbys""."
0," Not 500 watts!: I wanted to share this with others who may order this for the 500watts of power - it is only 320 watts! I burned out a 250w blender recently, and ordered this thinking it was double power. It wasn't much heavier when I removed it from the box, so I looked at the motor, and it said 320w. Evidently the 500w was the power of the european/220v motor, even though the outside of the box says plain as can be ""500w"".Needless to say, I returned it. I can't really rate it, just say it isn't what it says it is."
0," A Ridicullus Book. One of Voight's worst.: The mystery is awful. The book is predictable and formulaic. And I couldn't care much for the stupid characters who insist on making stupid mistakes. Jean's head is full of air since she can't see anything strait, and can't figure out the secret before we do. Stay away from this awful book."
0," Terribly disappointing: Incredibly average or below average toaster at a ridiculously expensive price. We bought this based on the great reviews (for this and other models identical except for color), and expected a toaster that performed well and was solidly built. We found neither to be the case. The build quality is no better or more substantial than the $20 toaster we bought this one to replace. We noticed a loud hum when the toaster was turned on, and several of the heating elements did not appear to function properly. And although the product description says it has maximum power, it didn't toast any faster or more evenly than our current cheap toaster. For the high price we expected something a whole lot better. We were sorely disappointed. I'd say keep looking. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1, DJ COMPANY: I really like this album especially the first 3 songs are all equally great and energenic. There are other good songs but you could listen to the first 3 over and over and not get sick .
1," Good replacement battery for your APC UPS!: This battery was a perfect fit from the standpoint of how the case fit into the UPS housing, and a very nice and perfect tight fitting plug. Handy recessed areas in the case of the battery allow you to hold on to this heavy brute while you gingerly work it into the battery compartment. Make sure you get your connecting wiring in the right place before you slide the battery into the case. Once installed it and buttoned the case back up, I plugged up the unit and presto...the dependable APC UPS unit circuitry recognized the battery, and the green light was on...once again. Fast shipment and packed really well. No need to replace your UPS, just get a fresh battery!"
1," Great CD: Generally, I shy away from ""Christian"" pop music, but I make an exception for the Bill Welch Band (I happen to know the guys, and have opened for a show of theirs). While the music of many Christian pop groups sounds forced and inauthentic to me, these guys' work is an undiluted look at who they are and what they believe. They also take a lot of time and care to make sure that the music they play is pure, is direct, and holds together. The band's members have some hard experience in the trenches of jazz, classical, blues, latin, R&B, and world music, and it really shows.However, the best experience of their music is a live show."
0," Historically inaccurate, mediocre-to-bad acting: This movie, while somewhat interesting, was so historically inaccurate and lopsided it's laughable. Alan Rickman's performance as Eamonn de Valera deserves particular mention; there's simply no way such a weak-minded man could possibly have served as taoiseach or president of Ireland. There's inadvertent humor in Julia Roberts's attempt at an Irish accent (and where are the strong Irish women so prominent in history?). If you want to watch a movie about the Irish struggle for independence, watch ""The Treaty"" -- it is more interesting and more historically accurate, and it has better acting."
0," Save your money: I had a Sony clock radio and was interested in getting a digital radio because the tuner always got bumped. This was supposed to improve the situation. Instead, I got a radio that will not pick up local stations with sound quality so poor that much of the conversation is not understandable."
1," Ultimate Collection ( Import ) Peter and Gordon: An excellent example of the best of "" Peter and Gordon "" .Good quality sound tracts and seemly complete ( 24 tracts ) set of the best from this British Duo .One downside is the lack of stereo tracts , less than a quarter of these songs have been recorded in stereo , a sign of the times in the mid sixties .Overall I rate this album ( CD ) very highly , a must for those who enjoy one of Britian's top male Duo's from the sixties."
0," June Doesn't Swing: I'm a huge June Tabor fan and have most of her CDs. She is a great interpreter of traditional folk music and contemporary singer-songwriters. She has a stark, dramatic vocal delivery and generally choses her songs with care and thought. What she is not is a jazz singer. Her vocals do not swing and just simply are not suited for jazz standards. Her singing on this album comes across as brittle and wooden. Her vocal range is not that dissimilar to Peggy Lee, but Peggy Lee is able to sing with a jazz rhythm and beat, while June, unfortunately, is not. Every artist is encouraged to stretch and try new areas, but I'm afraid this was a failed experiment on her part."
1, Samurai Champloo & Kung Faux are good to go!: Order Samurai Champloo & Kung Faux on dvd and learn the ways of BentoBox.TV in your own 36th chamber.
0," Worth waiting 18 years for? NOT!!: Seems that I'm a little harder to please than old T. C. The only reason that I gave this weak work a 2 is just because it's Niven. Otherwise, I would never have finished it. The Mote In God's Eye is one of the great works in SF. The best extrapolation of what an alien race trapped in their own solar system would be forced to evolve into in order to survive. Oh, sorry, I got carried away about a piece of GREAT fiction, not this garbage. Reading the phone book is more exciting. A forced sequel that the writers obviously could not have put their hearts into. Read Mote again and dream up your own sequel, you can't do any worse than this"
0," Black and Decker Single Serve Coffee Maker: I was not happy with this coffee maker for several reasons. First of all, my coffee cups would not fit into the area under the drip spout. Secondly, it did not keep the coffee warm. Our previous single coffee maker had a warming plate where the coffee cup sat and kept the coffee hot. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone."
0," I got bored...: After ""Silence of the Lambs"", I expected something dark, gritty and maybe a little gory. What happened was a lot of ""brainless"" violence, a strange story and an ending that is too screwed up for words.I'd say pass..."
1," Burns Like Fire: This is my favorite KISS album. It's the one that will never leave my car, and always picks me up, no matter how down in the dumps I am. Along with Love Gun, this is what I would take with me if I was stranded on a desert island.""Take Me,"" ""I Want You,"" and ""Baby Driver"" rock hard. And who could go wrong with ""Calling Dr. Love?""Rock and Roll Over is pure 70s KISS!!!"
0," Blowhard Narrative Hides Whatever Good There is Here: All kinds of folksy crap like, ""Now listen here, Son,"" gets in the way of whatever this guy has to say. He talks down to the reader, goes for obscurity in his tablature,, rather than clarification. I owned the book and actually couldn't wait to get rid of it. This is a book for people who have no ego and don't mind being treated like they have no brains."
0," Sony ECM-HQP1 Surround Sound Microphone: Although the sounds it records are very life-like, this microphone's HUGE amount of background hiss makes it totally unusable. I originally bought this microphone for my new Sony DVD camcorder. The result was beautiful video with sound that was reminiscent of a 1960's mono cassette recording with lots of tape hiss. This is not what I expect for a totally digital video and sound recording. I went back to the original built-in microphone, which has no audible hiss at all, and am much happier."
0," Terrible...: I bought this for my 13"" white MacBook. The stickers were so flimsy that the one piece that wraps around the track pad tore. They were also very difficult to peel off once they got dirty enough that I wanted to replace them. I ended up finding a clear plastic sticker set that worked much, much better and the discoloration didn't show up on it as quickly as it did on this product. The only good thing was the fabric that you put over your keyboard when closing your laptop, though I've barely used it since purchasing the set."
1," Starship Alzheimers: Anyone who has a parent or loved one tight in the grips of Alzheimers, Death in Slow Motion is a must read. Eleanor Cooney takes you by the hand and leads you on on odyssey that you will never forget. As you let her hand go as you close the book after the final page, you come away with a new vision, strength to endure, and perhaps most importantly of all, a new understanding that you are not alone."
0," Poor Mastering: While the mastering on this one isn't as dreadful as on ""From the Corner to the Block"", it is bad. There is a large amount of dynamic compression, a fair amount of distortion and clipping. All in all, I give the mastering a 2 out of 5. I'll leave it for the other reviewers to review the music.I bought 4 Galatic disks, and only one of them was shown care and attention when being mastered and that was ""Coolin' Off"". Batting .250, cest la vie.Oh and if you want to know more, look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia."
0," Great Movies, Bad Packaging: Despite the fact that the movies are perfect for any gore hound, the packaging is just stupid. Don't get me wrong, it looks cool, but it can not withstand the mail, apparently. I received it with numerous cracks in it. The discs were in great condition, but the plastic casing was shot. If you really need t get this, get it from Target or Half-Price Books."
1," ENJOYABLE & INFORMATIONAL: This is a great book for anyone,looking or that has purchased a new Bulldog, great photos, just a complete joy to read...MY advise is: don't pass this one up."
1," Must Read: This book, like no others that I have read, truly brings Tecumseh and the Shawnee people to life. Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. It was absolutely spellbinding. I could hardly wait to read the next page! James Alexander Thom gives us a perspective of Indian life that is truly fascinating and interesting and human. After reading this book I understand Tecumseh better and it makes me wish that I could have known him personally."
0, Does not fit: Will not fit my Artisan 5-quart bowl. This was a complete waste of money. I wish I hadn't ripped the packaging the way I did. Now I can't return them
0," from breathtaking to boring: I'm not going to get in a rant here about how much of his personal philosophy he has jammed into this book, since there are many other reviews here that have already done that. To be short and sweet: The series started out AWESOME, I devoured the first half of the series, not minding his occasional lectures on philosophy. Then, after half way through, the lectures started to get longer, and longer, and longer. Now, in the Naked Empire, you will literally come across many sections that have 15+ pages of his opinion on life. This book has bored me too much to go onto the others, which is a shame, the series was SO good..."
1," Good book!: My 13 month old son loves Blue's Clues and this was his first BC book. He loves ""discovering"" Blue's friends hiding behind the flaps. However the sandcastle flap did not last longer than 3 days ( that's why I only give 4 stars for the book). It was also very scratchy and not very good for Baby's that like to chew on almost everything.If the sandcastle was constructed a tad bit different this book would be wonderful."
1," Great product!: I have one for each of the four drivers in my family. When one went missing for a little while, the driver was quite upset. :) These are so handy for propping the GPS wherever you want it."
1," A really good movie...: I bought it for my daughter... I generally personally couldn't give a rats butt about Barbie... I just figured she would like it. Well, to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it too. You know, as a parent you end up in phases where you see the same show or movie over and over. This one is a joy to repeat unlike many other things out there. Seeing this 10 times or having to watch Little Einsteins again, I will take this EVERY time. : ) All that aside, my daughter (3) loves the movie and that is what matters most."
1, Good service: My book came quickly and in good condition. I am very pleased with my purchase and my product.
1, Excellent cuban stageband listening: This is a well executed highly listenable CD. Gets better the more you listen to it. Awesome solos and arrangements. You will not be disappointed if you like stageband music.

0," Poor Performance - Should have bought a DEWALT!!!: I went to the store to buy a DEWALT 18v cordless drill/driver. When I arrived I foolishly let a Porter-Cable Sales Rep. talk me into buying a Porter-Cable 19.2v Drill/Driver. BIG MISTAKE the drill works fine, the battery life is terribly short. The main selling point the Porter-Cable Sales Rep. had was that he insisted the new Porter-Cable 19.2v Batteries were a new technology in the way they charge and would outlast the DEWALT batteries-WRONG. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE DEWALT which is exactly what I am doing now."

0," Ultra-Liberal Backwash: If you enjoying listening to ultra-liberals damn every possible aspect of our evil foreign policy and captitalist greed, this book's the ticket.

1, Volume Control: It would be better if the external input would plug into the internal vs. the end of the controller. Otherwise it works fine and serves the purpose.
0," Absurd hatchet job: I picked this up for $2 used. I paid too much. This book is an offensive hatchet job, full of ridiculous claims that the author makes no attempt to substantiate. People simply make claims about RFK, and Heymann prints them. I know Bobby was no saint, and I don't expect hagiography. But this biography goes way too far in the other direction. One source compares Bobby to Caligula. At that point, I stopped reading the book. Save your money -- even if it is just $2."
0," Waste of money and time: I purchased this a few months ago. Within using it about 3-4 times, all 3 warming trays got holes which made the product useless. I contacted the manufacture and it took weeks and weeks of emails and voicemails before someone finally replied to my complaints of a defective product and sent me 3 replacement warming trays. All 3 replacement trays now have holes after 3 uses. Dont buy this product unless you want to only use it a few times and then wait weeks and weeks to get new trays. Waste of money. They should recall the item and offer full refunds."
0," A treat for football fans; a disgust for others: A friend of mine rented this movie and we watched it in my apartment on campus. What I didn't expect was its LENGTHY length of nearly three hours of seeing jolting, herky jerky camera movements and hard-core football images that we never see on ESPN or Monday night football. This is 100% man's flick and then some. Oliver Stone has a talent for telling the raw nature of events in his stories and this one is no exception. I had trouble finding a storyline because of the frenzied editing and vibrant soundtrack. Not everyone will be ready to see such scenes that take place in the locker room where the players unleash their pent-up frustration with no shame. Some scenes may cause head turning, such as one instance where we see full frontal nudity. However, this didn't appeal to me that much, but if you are a die-hard football fan this this flick is made just for you."
0," CFS (the BS): This propaganda piece does have some more accurate facts than some of the more atrociously unscientific publications on ME, so I was considering giving it 2 stars, but then I thought this was akin to ""letting the terrorists win."" And let's be clear, terrorists like Michael Sharpe, Simon Wesseley, Bill Reeves, etc., have caused much more suffering than the 9/11 terrorists. They need to be immediately put out on the street, have the embarassingly inaccurate UK, Oxford and Reeves definitions burned and all governments and researchers adopt the Canadian ME definition and have research funding increased 100 - 1,000 fold and have it put toward actual science, not the current garbage supported by the US and UK governments.For the real story on ME, read the amazingOsler's Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic"

1," Early Tuu evokes ancient perspectives & more tranquil times: Happily reissued by Waveform, this was an excellent early to mid 90's ambient work. Its slow pace, and atmospheric mix of synths and folk instrumentation, evoke a more human past in which dreaming and spiritual speculation were stronger than any mass media or cultural technology ... heck, way back when, myths and folklore WERE the mass media. The technology ... was spoken history, and musical expression. Not quite slow and serene enough for yoga or other meditation, but a suitable soundtrack to your own afternoon of quiet melancholy for a hidden past. On the [Scary (1) -> Angelic (10)] scale of ambient works, I'd position this at 6. Followed by ALL OUR ANCESTORS, also on Waveform, also highly recommended as a companion CD."
0," Couldn't finish this one.: I forced my way through all but the last 50ish pages. I gave up in a fit of cross-country road-tripping boredom was better alleviated by counting cow catchers in the Texas heat. I wish I was lying.Dull characters, no one to even remotely get interested in or even attached too! A world of low tech and warlord mentality should have been interesting. Wrong. Disarming has never been so flaccid."
0, Looks cheap...: It looks really cheap. Strap is flimsy and not worth 50$ and DEFINITELY not worth $250. I got this hoping to use it as a gift but it didn't look high-quality at all. I had to return it.
0," Never accurate; now useless: I've had this clock for a little over a year. Its temperature and humidity displays were never accurate. Its redeeming feature was its large time display I could read without glasses. Now, the clock will no longer set itself. The large display is still distinct, but the necessity to reset the clock manually reduces its value to that of a normal clock. I only use atomic clocks, so this is of no value to me now."
1," Works Great in Mid-2007 Apple iMac: Used this kit to beef up our childrens' ""play"" iMac (a 2007 20"" intel C2Duo 2.4 refurb)... the performace boost has been significant from the original 1GB of RAM that came with the machine. Have had memory in the computer now for about a week without any issues. Even given the short ""burn in"" time, the memory has scored a perfect run with Memtest both with initially installed and after a week of medium use (upgraded to Lion, transfered all family media from a legacy mac mini to it and installed a popular cloud-backup service and ran the initial backup on about 1.2TB of data). Will definitely use Crucial again for future Mac product memory upgrades."
1," Mama Knows Best: I hate to put a ""me too"" review here but that's what this amounts too. I too think McMillan's latest novel is quite good and one of her best.A Day Late and Dollar Short takes us through the travails of the Price family and they all, including the matriarch of the family, Viola, have flaws. What's endearing about this book is that Viola knows each of her children, her husband, and herself, so well and McMillan does a fine job at building the characters of each member of the family that by the end of the novel, we feel we know them well too. And Viola proves that she knows herself well too and her coda is truly heart warming and uplifting."
0," Incredible movie, disappointing DVD.: This was the best movie I saw this year. In fact, I saw it seven times in the theater. As a result of its great success and the huge buzz over Heath Ledger's legendary performance and tragic demise, I figured The special edition DVD would blow my mind-hole. This certainly was not the case. The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes. The other features (the full-framed IMAX scenes, a few mocked-up episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"", and a picture gallery) could have been left off as far as I'm concerned. No commentaries, no gag reels, no deleted or extended scenes, and not even a word about Ledger. Those are the things that make a SE DVD worth shelling out extra money for.If I had looked up the DVD to check out the special features before pre-ordering it, I'd have gotten the single disc edition. I suggest you do the same."
0," Boring as hell: The whole story from beginning to end was pretty uninteresting, and didn't add much to the TV miniseries. I had to force myself to read the entire thing, hoping it would get better. Not worth buying at any price."
1," Rapid Response: Our family needed this DVD to send as a birthday present. The mesage in ""Weeping Camel"" is timeless and universal. Having recently had opportunity to stay one night in a Yert, despite no near by camels, the resilience and laughter of Mongolian people is more than refreshing - even more than the famous ""pause that refreshes"". Older soda beverage cousumers will most appreciate this. The rapid response by Amazon is most appreciated.Thank you, camels, sturdy people, and Amazon staff. George W. Brown"
0," Geeky dialog could not have been worse!: Hated it! When I have to turn on subtitles for an American film to have the slightest idea of what is going on, then something's wrong in my book. This talky, nowhere film may have an appeal to some, but I vehemently hated it. Sundance Award or no Sundance Award, ""Primer"" would have never won in my book."
0, Stay Away!: I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails!Stay away not recommended.
1," Game Of the Year: This a great game.If you liked Diablo 1 you will love Diablo II.Sometimes i get so hooked that i stay up all night.Also you can go on to battle net it may be a bit slow but its still fun. you can test your power agianst many other people. You can choose 5 different characters the amazon,necromancer,sorceres,paliden,and the barbarian. Each character has there own speacial powers.there are 4 acts and many creatures to slay. also threre are thousands of items that willn help you in your quest. I hope this reveiw will help youdecide if you want to get Diablo 2."
0," failed attempt: Ward tries to reconcile materialism and Christianity--and fails. There are much better books on both sides. for the materialist side I would rather recommend Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker or The selfish gene; Rushton's Race, Evolution and Behavior; Jared's The Real American Dilemma; Hawking's A Brief History of Time. This are all beter books from the materialist side. And for a book soundly reconciling Christianity with materialism, I like beter Duke's My Awakening."
0," I don't know why, but my son doesn't like this toy...: It looks like a wonderful toy. My son is two and a half and has had this toy since his first birthday. He doesn't like it. I'm not sure why; he loves the Leapfrog Phonics bus which is similar in concept.He'll play with the Discovery Ball for a few minutes then wander away. The batteries died simply because it was left on pressed up against something -- not from use. I'm hoping someday he'll start enjoying this toy.I have to say I was nearly in tears trying to change the batteries on this toy. Honestly, it's the hardest battery change I've ever gone through in my entire life! And I almost injured myself because there was a lot of prying involved. The diagrams on the toy are so faint and tiny that you can hardly figure out what to do.I will not curse my new nephew by getting him this toy. When he's old enough, I'm getting him the Leapfrog Phonics bus instead!"

0, emeril pots and pan set: I bought this set as a gift for myself after a divorce and I was so excited to get them and use them. I uses them once and I HATE them! Everything sticks and they are very hard to clean after using. I would suggest looking for other pots and pans and skip these.
0," Zero stars: PASS! Juvenile. Story was uninteresting. Characters had zero dimension. A WASTE. Slow, boring and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
1," Nobody does it better than Carly: I was never a fan of Carly, when I heard 'Moonlight Serenade"" for the first time it was just ok. Now I can't stop listening to it again and again.I never liked ""I got you under my skin"", but with that new rhythm, I love it. Great arrangements, her tenor is unique, and beautiful, her phrasing is great, great job."
1, great for buzz cuts and touch ups: I bought this because I typically just shave my head every time I need a hair cut and occasionally do touch ups around the back of my neck. This razor works great and has saved me tons of money I would have spent at a barber shop. Also great for whenever any of my pals need a shape-up. Would recommend.
0," Not a thriller; a trite political screed: Grisham clearly is tired of writing thrillers and is trying to branch out into social activism. Just like his earlier book on capital punishment, this exploration of the politics of homelessness is a tiresome read."
1," Grand fun for adventurous souls!: I bought this book when it first came out and have thoroughly enjoyed making many of the ""recipes"" in the book.Another reviewer noted that the author sometimes recommends petro-chemical based ingredients.The beauty of any homemade potion is that YOU, the manufacturere and end-user are in complete control of what goes into the products you make.Take the time to learn about the characteristics of the basic ingredients and you'll be custom-mixing exactly what you want in no time at all.Have fun creating something special for yourself, your family and your friends!"
0," Christmas is a great time of year: Everybody used to love Christmas songs until Hanson had to go and ruin our Christmas spirits. I'd rather listen to the Chipmunks Christmas album than three little boys who still believe in Santa. I only gave this album one star because it was the lowest rating, really they don't deserve any stars. Maybe this year they should ask Santa for their voices to change, they made me ralph up my eggnog the first time I heard this album (believe me, I'm not joking). Anyone who actually likes these corny little dorks should ask Santa for a life. Get with it people, little kids just don't rock."
0," VERY SMALL IN SIZE: Although solidly made, this is a VERY SMALL whisk. Nine inches sounds big, but this will only suffice for whisking 2-3 eggs, or for those occasions when you don't want a full sized whisk. I was disappointed in it when it arrived. It's not what you want if you think it's a regular sized whisk."
1," Word - Sonny Bones is funky jammin fun: What a debut. Tight, jammin, upbeat. The bones are on their way. Word"
1, Great for cleaning!: These swabs are the same that I used in the army to clean my weapon. They are very durable and don't leave a cotton residue like a q-tip. Great for a variety of cleaning jobs in tight spaces.
0, Same - beeps and bad accents: I have the same opinion as the last reviewer. I was very disappointed by the fact that there were no native Italians on the CDs. Also the beeps are pretty annoying.
1," The Man in Lincoln's Nose . . .: . . .is what Hitchcock originally wanted to call this movie. He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well-crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter. Anybody ever read what William Goldman said about this movie in ""Which Lie Did I Tell?""? He was very complimentary of the screenplay, pointing out that about a dozen plot points are all tied up in the last minute or so of the film.And how can you go wrong with Cary Grant? The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self-deprecating & not especially impressed with his own good looks. I think that's what made him so endearing. Never more so than in this masterpiece."
1," Truly Authentic Chinese: I lived in San Francisco for about 10 years. I was truly thrilled to see my favorite Chinese restaurants and places shown as illustrations in the book. To my surprise, the recipes came out almost exactly like the ones I remember from my favorite restaurants! This cook book delivers the real goods, in a very well produced book. It is a pleasure to use. I tried several of the healing/balance recipes and they worked well for their declared use. That is not to say they were easy to down, I found them very far from pleasant. I guess that is the price one pays for trying traditional Chinese medicine"
0," POOR QUALITY TRANSFER: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VIDEO! Although W. C. Fields is wonderful, the quality of the tape is extremely poor. The sound can barely be heard in the opening and drops out entirely midway through the climatic chase scene. I have returned my tape and am surprised that amazon would sell such a poor quality product. Do not waste your money!"
0," Good for kids, but too easy....: This game would be fine for kids age 5-12, but I was dissapointed by how easy the game is. Also, I don't understand why everyone is saying the graphics are wonderful. They seem pretty mediocre to me. They are very jagged and very simplistic. I've seen better graphics on some PS One games. Again, great for young kids, but not for anyone with gaming skill."
1," Don't miss this one!: This book is without a doubt the most refreshing change of pace in the Dark Elf books yet! It's absolutely filled with Salvatore's trademark battle scenes and Dwarven humor, as well as a nice touch of tension. You'll quickly discover the obvious truth to this trilogy: It's going to be full of dark surprises and more action than Drizzt can handle(never that).Buy it, read it, love it! This book is worth every penny... and then some."
0, Don't waste your money on this: I don't understand how anyone can praise this book. I would not be surprised if the author himself actually posted the rave reviews there are. This book is definitely not worth the paper printed on. It's poorly written and has little to do with the actual certification exam.
1," off color musical and creative gem: Hard to describe why this film is so great, but Repo the Genectic Opera fans will understand that hint of flavor that's here in this film; for those not familiar, this film is a creative leap of faith from the director of the Saw movies and Repo the Gentic Opera (yes, Repo is ALOT like Repo Men BUT look it up and enlighten yourself ;-) Good movie, Great music, even my kid likes it!"
1," The BEST!: I love ""24."" I came across S1 on WGN while channel-surfing, and quickly became hooked. Since I couldn't bear to wait an entire week for the next episodes, I went ahead and bought S1-S4 on DVD. I'm not sorry! I am pleased to be addicted, and can't wait until the current season (S5) comes out on DVD also -- I want to watch the beginning again -- it has been a long time since it began in January!Makes you wish that the U.S. really DID have a Jack Bauer and a CTU on the team...ADDENDUM -- Now it is June 8, 2006, and Season 5 is finished. We have to wait 8 months for Season 6 -- ugh! I can't wait till S5 is out on DVDs -- I'll definitely purchase it here."
0," Different...: I watched this movie after seeing Isao Takahata's name on it. Coming from someone who directed Hotaru No Haka (Grave of the Fireflies), I thought it will at least be worth 2 hours of my time....It's definitely a departure from the heart-wrenching 'Fireflies'This is a light-hearted movie about a bunch of raccoons whose habitats are being threatened by men.While I thought the movie had its cute moments, the movie takes far too long getting to its conclusion.One other thing, I have never seen so many scenes of raccoons utilising their testicles....you'll see testicles being used to crush someone to death, testicles being used as a parachute, testicles being used as a rug, and my favourite - testicles being used to crash a truck.So if raccoon testicles are your thing, add 3 stars to my rating"
0," Dissapointing: This book was recommended to me by someone I highly respect but turned out to be a bit of a disapointment. It was a good tale, but it certainly did drag and was difficult to get thru. If I wasn't one who like to finish everything I start, I would have quit about halfway thru and now wish I had."
0, P.O.S.: I live in a cold area in oregon and drive a truck w a heater that only heats up when I'm going fast so I ordered this and just hoped all the other reviews were full of s*** but they weren't this thing is crap the little light bulb generates so little heat that I wasn't entirely sure it was working properly and then on the second day it blew a fuse
1," Another N64 Masterpiece: I really like the puzzles, all the shields, equipment, and weapons. Dont forget the dungeons. This game might be one of the best RPG games out there. this game is AWESOME!!!..."
1," Definitely Worth Getting: Profit was quite possibly the best show to ever air on the Fox network (The X-Files and The Simpsons included). It was also quite possibly the best show of the Nineties. Despite this, Profit only lasted for four episodes, all aired in April 1996. I am not sure why Profit was cancelled, but it could be that it was just too starkly original, too edgy, just too dark. Jim Profit was both the protagonist and the villain of Profit. Played by Adrian Pasdar, he was as evil as they come (J. R. Ewing was an amateur compared to him...). Profit worked for a large, international company and was willing to do literally anything to rise through its ranks. Created by David Greenwalt (who later worked on Angel) and John McNamara (who had previously written episodes of Brisco County Jr.), Profit worked very well as a dark satire of corporate America. It is little wonder to me that it has maintained a cult following to this day."
1, product will do the job: I ordered these for pee pads for my little dogs. They are thin and after a few pees it's ready for the trash. That's ok though as I wouldn't want to leave it on the ground for too long. A satisfied customer.
0," Good while it lasted: This griddle was good while it lasted. We've had this for about 2 years now and it desperately needs replacement. The non-stick has started peeling and it is difficult to clean. Moreover the surface has warped though that isn't a big problem for a gas range, it does cause any oil/butter to collect on the sides instead of the center."
0, Old School: This book is so outdated and basic. The pictures & examples are quite rudimentary. For a better value check out The Flash Animator.
0," most disappointing: given the quality of other monographs by this publisher, the beauty of HCB's landscapes etc., and especially the price of this book, one has every right to expect something special. Sadly this book is far from special. Each illustration has a thick black surround which, frankly makes it impossible to concentrate on, and enjoy the image content. The quality of reproduction is average, somewhat lacking the sparkle of other monographs. Still worse are the vast acreages of blank white pages. What is going on here ??, the number of images could have been doubled and more, quite easily. Information on location, and context are frustratingly sparse - I do not know if HCB did keep a log of his locations, but it would be nice to have rather more than, say, ""Japan"". This rich and fascinating area of HCB's work deserves a proper presentation, rather than just something that seems to have been 'cobbled together', as this has."
0," Black Sabbath Interrupted: The only thing about this DVD that really bums me out, is that the interviews are in the middle of the songs. I think to be able to enjoy a live concert, the songs should not be interrupted by interviews and stuff that should be in the special features part of the DVD.I hope if they release another live DVD, the concert will be the main focus."
0," The only way to sell the one movie is to bundle it with the other: Defending your life is a cute movie, too bad they had to package it with the crappy movie of Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World. Yawn."
0," Try something else: A friend of mine let me borrow this book. Real Estate is in the genre of business. Business actually has scientific principles governing it. The only way to make money with business is to pull out more money than you put in. The book does not describe how to go about doing this. It makes some fanciful overtures, but in the end, all it is doing is describing some lucky dice rollers. These people got lucky. Their success is luck and won't apply to you. The rest of the book is advertising. If you want a quick way to make money, affiliate programs are the only means to make it happen. Even most of those are [junk]. Anyone interested in learning real business science can e-mail me. And I won't charge you. ddogslanina at hotmail dot com."

0," Put Down the Beer: I got into country music because of Kenny Chesney... I liked the stories he told in his songs and they were funt o listen too... I don't know what happened, but the stories about life he told before were about real things things that could happen to people... About Love, Life, and Family... This CD's songs about life are typical of a life long Spring Break... It's all about drinking... Having a drink in this hand, a drink in that hand... Palm trees... Drinking, drinking, drinking... It's almost as if Chesney joined a Fraternity... His old songs were better... He needs to stop hanging out with that I Can't Write a Song of My Own Uncle Kracker and realize that one Jimmy Buffett is enough..."
1," For any age, and goes anywhere: Uno is an excellent game for any age 7 and up (according to the makers; I've watched a sharp 4 yr old enjoy playing with only slightly modified rules). It is easy to learn but continues to provide challenging play for years. The rules are easily modified to accomodate diffenent skill levels or time available. This one doesn't need bells and whistles, it is great as it is.Although Mattel would not encourage this (or even suggest it) playing for points lends itself to modest wagers, and to an extent, allows for handicaping with players of different skill levels.The educational value is not obvious, but is significant. It teaches players to think ahead, consider branches and sequels of actions, and strategy.The compact size (like two standard poker decks) allows this one to travel well, and can be played on trains, planes, boats, buses, and in tents."
0," LG Fusic is terrible: In the five months that I have owned this phone, I have had 4 batteries, and replaced the entire phone, and it still doesn't work! I don't know if it is Sprint or the phone, but about 1/2 the time, calls will go directly to voice mail, and I may not get a voice mail notification for hours! Even without using the phone, the charge won't last longer than 5-6 hours. This phone is terrible, and the service and support is just as bad! That's about $300 I won't get back!"
1," Some things never change: I just found this book used and loved it.It's about the head of a company facing mandatory retirement by his own policies. It's very light hearted but at the same time, it shows that some of the issues we deal with now (not enough savings, too much spending) have been dealt with before.Like many other 50's and 60's novels, it also shows business from the viewpoint of people who had actually worked in business. His insights (especially when he's trying to figure out what to do AFTER he retires) rang very true. It was a very enjoyable quick read.More importantly, it has made me want to find other books by Streeter.Thank you."
0," Test it Out Before You Bye it: The front of this game is very misleading, because it makes the game look really cool. Even though Wario Land 3 has good graphics for gameboy color, it is not a very good game. You can't die, save in the middle of a level and somettimes you can't get back to normal after you've turned into something bad. Wario Land 3 is only good for a few hours and then you will wish you didn't get it. So, if you see a game you want, test it out first."
1," A thriller from begining to end: This was the first Clancy book I ever read. From the first time I picked it up to when I finished it, I could not put it down! It is a MUST read for ALL MILITARY FANS! Though the book is a little old and some of it might confuse people today (i.e. F-19, it is actually today's F-117) It is a magnificently written book."

This hardly explains the Israeli chief of staff's (Rabin) nervous breakdown, or the then ex-PM's (Ben Gurion) white hot fury with him for what he perceived as an existential danger.Oren's book is far more extensively sourced from Arab, Hebrew, Russian documents as well as English one - and unlike Bowen evidently strives for precision and balance. The comparison between the two is highly illuminating."
0, Falls apart: Acoustically it was ok but it kept falling apart. The areas where it was screwed in would just fall on the ground. I noticed several other people in my class with the same kind of scope and theirs would fall off too.
0, Bomb: U2 better dismantle this bomb before it is too late. This album tries to be something U2 is not. Instead of making 'Pop' music for the younger crowd - U2 needs to stick to the music that put them in stadiums and the rest of us have grown up with. Disappointing at best.
0," Dake Annotated Reference Bible-KJV (Hardcover): Disappointed it was not the large print edition I was expecting according to the view shown when I evaluated what the book looked like. Now I don't have time to return it because I need it for bible classes. Having alot of difficulty reading it I need my glasses and a magnifing sheet. Otherwise the price, content and value of information is good."

BUT WHEN IT COMES OUT, IT PULLS THE ENTIRE LIGHTER SOCKET OUT!!! I AM SO PISSED OFF!!!!!!!!! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE PIECE OF CRAP PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!"
1," very much fun: I have been reading Wil's blog for a while now and I find myself checking in for updates on a daily basis. When Dancing Barefoot came out I bought an early run copy and really enjoyed. Short, entertaining stories -- well worth the price of admission.Heartily recommend and I am looking forward to the follow up."
0," DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!: I read the reviews and believed them. When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird. First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man? And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep??? And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well. I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book. After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book ""SCARY!"" So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift."
1, Another Winner of Stormie's Books in my Opinion.: I love this book because it helps you remember to cover ALL of the things you can pray for when it comes to your man and his needs or wants and/or his weaknesses whether you know them or not. Such a good Bible based Christian book.CC
1," Good all purpose scanner: I've bought this scanner to scan both reflective media and films. Paper scans are amazingly clear, 35mm film scan is acceptable for a flat bed, but still not close to that from a HP s20. FARE takes out a lot of detail, but help a lot with the dust. Using it at the low setting work best for me. The scanner will scan medium format film properly. All you have to do is make a card board frame for it. One big problem I have with it is it won't create more than 6 thumbnails for batch scanning at 2400 dpi. Considering how the marketing dept stress the capability of batch scanning 12 frames , I'm disappointed in this. I'm contacting Canon to see if I'm doing something wrong and their support has been slow."
1, I highly recommend this one-of-a-kind gift book: This beautifully written and beautifully illustrated book is the perfect gift for new and expectant parents. A keepsake that will be treasured for years.
1," Rooney fantastic!: I bought the Rooney DVD at Amazon because it was by far the cheapest way, even with additional shippingcosts to Europe. And I had it home in 6 days only! This is a DVD every Roony fan should have."
0, Patricia C. Wrede: I like most of Patricia C. Wrede books but this one was very boring and lacked a good story line dont get this book.
1," Christopher Moore is awesome: This isn't his best, but it's still pretty funny. I would recommend ""Lamb,"" ""A Dirty Job,"" ""The Stupidist Angel,"" or ""Fool"" to start off with. Once you're addicted to the writing, you'll just have to buy all of them."
0," Useless: Not good for what I bought it for(copying program for a class), not even good for backing up my computer. Absolutely useless.P.S.Neither me or my prof are using a mac, I have a Vaio operating on vista, and he's probably using 7 or some kind of lunix"
1," most informative: i found the book a very good read. compared to the pinkerton detectives version of the events of this period it is a refreshing search for the truth. however, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. the facts remains several men were sentenced to the gallows on the questioable testimony of two men. james mcpartland (aka mckenna;) the pinkerton man who infiltrated the AOH & Mollies whose own activities make one question the justice system in the coal regions during this time and jimmy kerrigan; a convicted thug & murderer. the executions of jack kehoe & alex campbell have still not been adequetly justified to this reader and bimba tells why."
0," A true dissapointment from an almost legendary band: I bought this cd after being a fan of the band since their debut, but with every release since Animals With Human Intelligence, they've been slowly getting worse and worse and worse, and finally, this album, aside from a very few high points, is practically unlistenable. I don't know what happened to the band's edge. The seem to have traded their hard rock style for sappy, soulless alternative pop. I gave it two stars-One for their awesome past, the other is for a better future."
1," If you loved the movie, you'll want this book!: This is a beautiful book, crammed full of interesting information. I loved reading the interviews with the cast members. I never really thought about how much work and attention to detail that the people ""behind-the-scenes"" went through to make such a production happen. It was especially fun to see the actors out of their 'Pride and Prejudice' make-up; some of them looking entirely different than the character they portrayed. The sections on how many of the people responsible for making this mini-series so wonderful [director, writer, producer, etc.] was enlightening. How they 'saw' what they wanted and then made it happen. The whole book was delightful and I'd highly recommend it."
1," Not pretty...but great function: Purchased these based on positive reviews.They perform they task very, very well--cut through everything like its butter without shaking the table.I wish the handles were more visually appealing, but best price/value.I recommend these to anyone seeking ""affordable steak knives"" with exceptional function.PS: be careful when using and washing....they are sharp, sharp, sharp."
1," works great: This rower works great and gives a great workout. However, the end of the metal bar where the seat slides was bent and two plastic parts were broken during shipping which resulted in open sharp metal without a cover. I accidently tripped over it and cut my ankle quite badly. My husband straightened the metal out but the new plastic end cover still does not fit...so it's covered with tape. I like the workout as it rows as in ""sculling"" which is what I wanted."
1," Cooking For Fifty: A freind of mine let me use her copy of this and I really liked it so bought it to use in the kitchen at church. It has come in very handy ,but remember this an older cook book and does give the recipes like we used then . I LIKE THAT THO JUST MAKE IT MODERN .. iF YOU COOK FOR A GROUP YOU WILL LIKE IT."
0, The sea monkeys wear dead.: I bought this product and when I put everything together the sea monkeys never came to life. It was a waste of money.
0," Bad for large jobs: Same problems as Fred's review, I have about 100 sheets of wasted paper. Printer is going back today, gettting an epson."
0," Only 100 pages left to go....: Oh my God....it has taken me a month and a half to get through this book. I dread going to bed at night to read it in spite of my dogged determination to get through it. While I find most of Grisham's stuff to be shallow but at least entertaining, the Chamber, however, is dull dull dull. Having bamboo shoved under my fingernails is sound pretty good as an alternative to yet one more evening struggling through this book. Next time you're browsing the Grisham section leave this one on the shelf you wouldn't want to disturb the dust."
1," Great book!: I enjoyed Ill Wind tremendously and look forward to the next book in the series. On the nitpicking front, it was interesting that in the book, tropical storm Samuel was early in to the Hurricane season, but starting with a letter ""S"". Assuming in this alternate-universe, that the same naming scheme is followed, that means there were an awful lot of named storms early in the year."
1," glittering verse with jitterbug swing: molly tenenbaum's poems sparkle and dance in the half light and shadows of everyday cracks and crevices. from the smallest of spaces, she pulls out shining moments of laughter and wit, sadness and compassion, intelligence and grace. this is a book for dusk and twilight -- day's end when the events of the world seem too big and bruising, day's end when poems can restore a slender thread to sanity, a slight, but firm, connection to intimacy and reflection. it's a wonderful debut."
1," Invaluable baseball reference: A book constantly open at my desk, rapidly becoming dog-eared, it is invaluable to my research into the lives and deaths of baseball personalities. I recommend the book highly to anyone doing similar research. I am especially interested in ballplayers who were Veterans of the Military and Lee gave me thousands to work with."
1, Fundamentals covered well with illustrations.: This is a good book that covers all the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking. Good illustrations. Seperate chapters for each common application protocols.
0," The Straight Jacket Handbook: OMG, OMG...They have now finally hit the bonafide insane stage!!!! This book's more appropriate title should be ""The Straight Jacket Handbook"". It is a real look into the insane world of the so-called claymates (eventhough Clay himself hates the name).Dive into ""their world"" and you'll soon realize how truly scary this ""cult"" is, but if you really want to get a good hearty laugh without wasting your money, go to the library (the ""loony books"" section), check this book out and I'm sure you'll laugh for days!!!!!Just more people attempting to make money off Mr. Aiken...(make sure you pay the man his royalties for profiting off his fame....)"
0," Garbage that stinks: I purchased 3 of these phones. Of the 3, 2 do not work.One worked for 6-months and then displayed ""Not registered"" and was rendered useless.The other upon installing had all keys activating the speaker phone functionality. It would not make calls nor could it be tunred off. I had to unplug it.AT&T; would not make good on the unworkable phones."
0," Terrible book. Fireplace fodder, at best.: This ""Exam Prep"" was an unbearable wandering through the mind of an ""author"" that seems to have no concept of who the target audience of this book is. There are PLENTY of better TCP/IP books on the market, and as far as preparing for the MCSE exam, this book is junk. (Note to Amazon, please allow a zero-star rating option for books like this.) The Exam-Cram for TCP/IP was a FAR better source of information. DO NOT BUY (or even take from a friend's garbage can) THIS BOOK!"
1," A beautiful recording of spectactular music: I am amazed at the outstanding quality of this CD. It is truely beautiful, and the two Tchaikovsky works that are very rare are surpisingly beautiful. This has a fine balance of Russian music. The Glazunov is naturally a beautiful concerto that has ben played extremly well.The Kabalevsky was shockingly good, and an exellent balance of modern and romantic music."
0," AWFUL: This book doesn't earn a single star (but it's a required field for Amazon, so I had to give it one). It's a real letdown for Forsyth fans. If you're looking for his usual intricate plotting and character development, forget it. You won't find it here. The style is simplistic and the vocabulary wouldn't challenge an elementary school student. A real waste."
0," Walking upon the Grave of Frank Stanford: C.D. Wright was a ""friend"" of Frank Stanford before he took his own life. Frank Stanford's great masterpiece was ""The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I love You."" ""Deepstep Come Shining,"" is a terrible rip-off of that poem, and because C.D. Wright is not a genius like Frank Stanford, she is unable to come close to carrying this off. The poetics are mired in bad prose, and the whole poem has a workshopped fakeness to it, and more so if you read her poem next to the overpowering genius of Stanford's.Read Frank Stanford's masterpiece."
0," Final Exit: This video doesn't deserve any stars. I think that it is very sick of someone to make a video to tell old people that it is good to kill them selves when they are sick. Yes, I understand that they are VERY sick and that they are suffering, but to promote sucide is just wrong. and soon it will be spread onto younger kids, letting them think that it is okay to die just because you dont feel well. Things get exagerated over time, this certin topic, I think will be exagerated. And people will be droping like flies!"
0," Cheap and flimsy and damaged!: My 14 month old runs around the house with an old Liz Claiborne purse that she found in the bottom of my closet. She loves it but the handles are too long for her and I wanted to get her something more bright and fun, so I ordered this for Christmas.When I got it in the mail I was excited...until I opened it. It's JUNK! Seriously, I could do better at the dollar store!! The flower is already partially coming undone, the plastic phone edges on the top are razor sharp, the mirror is flaking and this is JUST OUT OF THE BOX! I'm shipping this piece of crap back. I am less than impressed with this item."
0," Watch those reviews!: I read all the reviews and this sounded like a great movie. I like old movies, this isn't one of them. I've seen some stupid shows and this one certainly fits into that catagory.Kings of the Sun"
1," Best I've ever used!: I love these baking pans! Oil does not stick so they are a breeze to clean. Also they don't warp while in the oven like my old ones did. I have not yet used it for cookies, etc., but I'm quite sure it will work great."
1," no reviews?: well, i was just checkin to see if the boogiemonsters had anything new out yet and i could'nt believe there were no reviews for this album. these are definately some talented people here and it's a very good album. these two guys are christians but they dont really preach it all that much so thats cool. good lyrics good beats what more do you need?"
1," The Explosive Art of Muay Thai: This is an excellent resource book for the basics of Muay Thai boxing. The photographs are clear and give detailed examples of techniques. Based on the fact that it is difficult to find any literature on the art of Thai Boxing, I recommend this book for any enthusiasts library. If you are looking for any thing other than basics, this is not the book, and the chances of finding such a book without actual Muay Thai instruction is pretty slim. Overall 4 stars"
0," Cheap Products: Is anyone else having problems with their Simpsons DVDs? Ever since season 5 I've had to return my DVDs because one or more of the discs don't work properly and certain episodes skip. I'm stuck with a faulty season 6 because I lost my reciept and I've already discovered I need to exchange my new season 7 set thanks to at least 3 episodes that skip. (All on the 2nd disc.) Please let me know that I'm not the only one out there with this problem.The Simpsons has been one of my favorite shows since I was just a little trouble maker in elementary school. It's great, but I'm only giving it one star because of the cheap manufacturing."
1," Good one volume history of the First State: Dr. Munroe has written an excellent one volume history of Delaware. He weaves political, economic and social history together in an interesting fashion that explains Delaware's unique character and happenings. For Delaware natives and afficionados, this is probably as good a background as there is on the First State."
0," Horrible -- do not buy: I am returning my unit tonight - it is not a good product. The problems include:* Range is about 6"", yes inches. I have the keyboard/mouse on a keyboard tray and the transmitter sitting on the desk. It complains about having a weak signal. The keyboard also misses keystrokes because of this. I'm using the batteries supplied with the product.* Middle mouse clicks are nearly impossible. I use a browser that supports middle-mouse click to open a new window in the background. This is virtually impossible to use with this mouse. You have to try at least 5 times to get the mouse to register a middle click.* The keyboard itself is a little cramped compared to my old, wired Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite."
1," Fiskars 7067 3-Piece Softouch Garden Tool Set: Cast aluminum garden tools, I was tired to buy tools that do not last me for a year, bought the Transplanter 3 years ago and finaly the tip broke this year, since fiskar has lifetime warranty I call them, they toll me to send the item in question either by mail o sent a picture by email to get the warranty replacement, so sent a pic by email , week after I received a brand new cultivator by mail, that motive me to buy this set and of course buying fiskar product for now on. Their tools are if not best, one of the best.Easy to handle, comfortable, non breakable, solid and sturdy like everybody said in this item review. I really recommended."
1, Chair Saver: The purchase was a spur of the moment thing while I was making another purchase and I decided to look for the product because I had seen it in a catalog along with the item I was looking for. I am so far satisfied with it and may purchase another in the future.
0," piece of junk - don't waste your money: This is probably the worst headphones I ever had - lousy sound quality, lousy fit in ears, cheap plastic and nothing but bad experience overall.Did I mention lousy sound quality and cheapness of materials. I want to emphasize that.don't waste your money and time on this. *almost* anything else is ok, compared to this"
0," Don't buy it.: I bought my in July 03 and now in Sept. 03 I'm going to have send it back in for repair already. The player does not read read my DVDs (even the new ones) any more. It keeps saying that there is no disc. This is too much hassel for a $60 player. I'll have to pack it, send it in and wait for it to be fixed or replaced. The AD2500 is not bad, it does very much everything I want to use it for. But this is way too unreliable."
0, Blah: From all the reviews i thought this would be a great CD. the only song i liked was the one that plays on the radio. Maybe i will have to give it some time and let it grow on me...i would not suggest buying it ... just listen to the radio ....
1, Music: Cant find this cd anywhere.looked on all the music stores online.its the good old music from the rat pack.the price was just a little high for its age though.
0," Tell Em Steve Dave: This movie is almost unwatchable. And this is coming from a huge view askew fan. I even own Drawing Flies. But the only thing good about this disc is the Dogma Documentary that Columbia Tri-Star was too chicken to put out on the Dogma DVD. Some people might like this moviebut I doubt many will. There's not much of a point to it all.After watching the movie I had a weird feeling. BecauseI never got bored watching Vulgar,Nor did I feel a need to eversee it again.Hopefully We can get Kevin Smith to change his mind about the end of Jay and Silent Bob."
1, Love the product.....: Love the product but do not take it anywhere without a plastic bag. It does not seal well. On traveling trips it always gets on the plastic bag and not traveling by plane so that is not the issue
0," Don't Bother: In theory, this is a great product. The quality, as stated in many of the reviews, is poor. Depending on the color of the square, you get varying lengths for tying. Unfortunately my 7 year old got the yellow - the shortest of all the colors. After 20 minutes, she quit in frustration. I've been working on it for two hours and am no where near finished. The fabric begins to fray almost immediately after the tying process begins. I'm glad I purchased this on sale, but it would have been cheaper and of a much higher quality to purchase fleece from a fabric store to make your own."
1," Perfect and portable: This is a wonderful crate for my beagle mix. He uses it mostly in the car and I love the option of the front and side openings. It collapses and sets up very easily and he seems pretty comfortable in it. Overall, I'm very pleased."
0," Too Thick and Feel so greasy: The cream is way too thick and greasy. I don't feel comfortable after put it on in the morning... , because the thickness of the cream, you need to use a bit more than normal cream which makes it even worse..."
1," Overall, the RCA L4000BC is cream of the crop for LCD TV's.: Pros : Large 4.0"" Active Matrix LCD; very sharp, clear, and crisp picture; wide viewing angle, sound quality is good with reasonable dynamic range, signal reception good even in questionable areas, unit is easy to hold and grasp, nice feel and texture to case with non-slip rubber over mold, built in hand strap is convenient, has removable battery pack, hooks up easily to either VCR or CamCorder, comes with AC wall adapter and DC car adapter.Cons : is a definite battery drainer, AC adapter jack is right under hand strap making holding the unit a little uncomfortable, should have a snap on protective screen cover, 2 speakers would have been nice too for Stereo broadcasts."
0," Heart Rate Readings all over the map...: I had pretty high expectations for the Timex to replace my existing HRM since I'd had one of the first Timex HRM's a while ago and was very pleased with it. However, after reading up in the training manual and strapping it on for my first workout, I noticed strange behavior; it read my resting heart rate spot on, but after starting my workout, it kept reading significantly low rates for the first half hour of the workout. It was like it kept ""creeping up"" on my heart rate. 15 minutes into the exercise, I should have been low 120's and it was still in the 80's and climbing. Towards the end of the workout it finally peaked over 160, and stayed there, when it should have been 130's to 140's. Strange! I thought maybe it was calibrating itself, but it did the same thing the next time out. Definitely a problem with it. I turned it back in, and decided to get a Suunto T4C HRM...much nicer IMHO."
1," Excellent Resource about Godel, Einstein and Time: This book discusses the interesting relationship between Godel and Einstein and more importantly, Godel's insight into time using Einstein's relativity. For the non-physicist like me, it did an excellent job. Godel's work had some limitations, which the book in my opinion was careful not to cross.I've read ""Godel's Proof"" and ""I am a Strange Loop"" and this is a worthy read if one is interested to learn more about this brilliant man."
0, Broke after 40 days: The vacuum is heavy and did clean well when it works. It is very hard to manuver though. The belt broke after about a month. Something is not adjusting the belt and is makes a burning rubber smell. To get it fixed I have to drive 2 hours to phoenix. They do not have send in warranty service. I will never by another Eureka.
1," What Noise? Just great songs!: Why you should bother: Most pop really sets me on edge. I get agitated, irritated and crankier than usual. A listen to Psycho Candy will set things right - I calm down, relax, all becomes well with the world.The songs: These are beautifully crafted pop songs, that are seemingly simple and yet very compelling. They make it look easy, almost, but not quite too easy.The sound: The J&MC have a great and distinctive sound. Real feedback, a sound that has been often imitated but never replicated. I can listen over and over again and get more out of that great sound! It adds complexity to the songs, but won't distract unless you let it.The recording: I saw their first US tour, I think it was '85 or '86. They were great. The sound and production of this CD do them justice.Can you take it?: There may be those who think the J&MC is noise. They probably don't get out much, perhaps even less than I do. So, if you haven't heard or just don't like any punk rock you may not get it."
1," Eric cire: Could you imagine having a gun to your head and being on a plane with an assassin? Alex Rider has been. He is a spy that works for a group called M16 and was training with the S.A.S. Sabina is Alex's friend and when Alex is in trouble Sabina is there to help. Alex has been in a lot of situations with a gun to his head and he has always survives. The main maniac is Damian Cray. He said that he was trying to stop drug use was he ?.No he was trying to blow up half of the earth.There also is a Russian man named Yassen Gregorovich. He helped Alex a lot of times escape even though he's a bad guy, he doesn't act like a bad guy. if he would save Alex's life I would consider him a good guy. Yassen told Alex that his dad was paid to kill people and how that he use to work with his father and how his father saved his life. Damian Cray is a man who likes to poison to kill people.I would suggest this to people age 10 to 15 and people who like action and adventure thank you."
0," A pain in the [butt]: I have had one of these for weeks and have had Hell's own time trying to get it to work with Win2K. When it is kind enough to let itself be installed, it stops woring when I restart. I got complex instructions from SanDisk support involving a registry edit and it failed again. Now they are telling me I need to use it with a powered hub. I bought one, and I will try it, but for now it is an expensive paperweight."
0, bottles break: I bought this for a gym the bottles break constantly we currently have had over 15 broken pumps/bottles within less than a year
0," It is Rush, but not like the good old stuff.: A lot of it sounds the same. I love Rush, but I believe they lost their luster around Signals. Everything started sounding the same. The explosiveness and creativity kind of went down the drain. Still would love to see them live, but nothing compares to the stuff they did prior to Moving Pictures."
0," skymama: This book has some good general information on nutrition and such, but lacks in simplicity when it comes to the actual recipes. They are a bit ""too"" gourmet, and call for items that you would normally not have on hand. I'll tell you what; I am on my second pregnancy right now and I am too hungry to take the time and enegy to cook these recipes!"
0," Will not produce different grind coarseness: Although this thing has 16 different settings for how fine or coarse you want your coffee ground, regardless of the setting it ALWAYS grinds to about the same degree of coarseness: that for a drip coffee maker. It WILL NOT grind coarse enough for press-pot (french-press) coffee, nor will it grind fine enough for espresso. Unless all you make is drip coffee, do not purchase this.I followed the Krups directions for dealing with this problem to no effect. It simply does not grind to different coarseness."
0," Bloody Terrible!: Don't waste your time! I have read her other novels, some good mixed in with average, and this is the worst. She redeemed herself with Jemima J which is why I decided to read her latest. What a waste of time. I finished it because I hate not finishing books but it was a trial. Ugh. Also, I would hate to see any of her readers take any parenting advice from the main character in her book! For a better read, try Jemima J. For a better author, try Marian Keyes!!"
1," The English Governess vs. Anna and the King: Quality of the physical book -- fine. Value of the content -- really interesting. Not surprisingly ""The King and I"" and ""Anna and the King"" lifted and/or created a story line somewhat based on the experiences of Anna Leonowens. Her own version is fascinating (Siam had two kings at a time, and the King of the play and movies was a complicated and definitely not romantic character). Her book gives a vivid picture of a time and place long gone. A good read."
0," Typical Will Ferrell movie: Why I didn't like it and why we found another movie to watch after ~10 minutes:Crass humor (typical for Will Ferrell) that was inappropriate for most of the dialogue and cast.Trailer did not showcase adequately the reason for the R rating and our family of 5 adults/3 teenagers found the crass 'humor' and comments embarrassing, not funny, and pointless to the plot of the movie.The movie could have been enjoyable and funny without them as the premise of the movie was timely with a cast that is well known for bringing laughs.Very disappointed."
0," Rough and shows sweat: This is a tough shirt, but a bit of a nipple-chafer if you work hard for a living. It also changes color drastically when wet, and pools sweat in the pocket stitching to make weird patterns. Not really a ""work"" shirt unless your work is paperwork. :) Sizes do run large. I wear an XL shirt normally, but this XL is now the largest shirt I own. :)"
0, yawwwn: unless you're enthralled by marilyn manson videos then you'll probably not like this film. i have never been so bored. it wasn't funny. it wasn't stylish. it wasn't scary. it wasn't at all intelligent. it felt like a behind-the-scenes of a extra white trash haunted hayride (only totally un-funny). it wasn't even gross. it was so boring i think i'm going to barf. then i'm going to sell my copy of this movie.
1, Incredible Collaboration of Two Masters of their Art: Barcelona is an incredible collaboration of two very disticnt but equally incredible talents coming together in a very smooth blend of music that promises to become a mainstay in both the opera and pop aficionado's collection.This blending of two masters each representing their own blend of classical and pop training should prove to be an enduring classic of our time.
0," What a travesty: I wish this was a joke, but it's not. This is a novella dressed up to look like a paperback novel. It formatted with decoractive headers and footers to take up more space, and a third of the book is actually a preview of an upcoming book.The ""plot"" exists only as an excuse to get Micah and Anita in a hotel room together. Hamilton's Anita Blake book have changed genre from modern horror/fantasy to softcore pornagraphy.I don't mind sex in books, but only if it doesn't get in the way of the plot. In the case of the later Anita Blake books, sex *is* the plot. That wouldn't be so bad, if Hamilton was any good at writing sex. But, her sex scenes are dry and disinteresting, and make me yawn. You find yourself turning pages trying to spot where the sex ends and the story continues. But, the way her most recent books are written there isn't really a story left once you remove the sex."
0, Trash Film: Bill Maher is as annoying as the nut cases he interviews. Trash film at its worst. A waste of time.
1," Nice, light, sturdy and fast: This is a great, light weight mono-pod. The camera (E-510) mounts to it quickly and the head holds it tight. The ball on the head stays put even with a larger zoom lens on it and the leg sections are easy to extend. They also stay in place once the levers are locked down.All in all this is exactly what I was expecting and it fits my needs perfectly.So why only 4 stars and not 5? I would have liked a built in clip that would make it easy to attach to my camera bag; I had to make one of those myself.Other than that - a great item."
0, Don't Waste Your Money!: The velcro and plastic hurt after 10 minutes - I tried to relax and distract myself from the plastic that was gouging into my foot and the velcro that was irritating my skin but couldn't take it anymore -- had to rip the stupid thing off and it went straight into the trash!!!
1, a great read for every mother and child: a wonderful socialogical depiction of a defiant character. the mother challenges the norms of society more than a day then most do in a lifetime.
1, Outstanding: The Conquerors by Michale Beschloss is one of my new faviort books on the market. If you are a history buff like myself i highly recomand this book for you. The book starts a bit slow but soon explodse with the first atempt to kill Adof Hitler.The book starts off with the United States Presendint Roosevelt and soon leads into Trumans Rain. I really could go on for hours about this great read but i dont whant to spoile the whole book for you. i highly recomand this read for a history buff like myself. plez give it a chance you will love it.
0," Please...: Attacks like this are fruitless and contribute nothing to the great national debate. The Right has crucified Michael Moore for quoting out of context. But it's OK for Horowitz and company? That is irrational.It would do us all good to shelve the ""well Limbaugh said, well Franken opined"" ideologies and instead focus on facts, and a collective search for the truth for the benefit of all. Because in the end, I've got a revelation for all Americans: It's not about you and your ideas. It's not about me and my opinions. It's about all of us working together for the good of all humanity.And bitter, sensationalist, Jerry Springer show hack jobs like this do nothing to further that cause."
1," Great Quality: I got this for Christmas and was surprises at how great the quality is (compared to the price), the wooden (bamboo) paddle is very sturdy and well constructed, and the Sushi Mat is well tied together and holds up perfectly. The book included gives basic information for rolling sushi, however, the internet or full book with pictures might help me out better since I am new to this.In the end I am amazed at the quality and strength these items have, and look forward to many years with these items rolling my own sushi!!!"
1," Fab new album is f a b o l o u s: Its not meant to be hard court street slanging rap. Its cool lay back relaxed, and listen to the whole album straight. You can not get tired of this alvum and it is of him stepping out of the shell and appealing to a wider audience."
0," Ouch, this movie is exceptionally ...[bad]: I was fooled by the 3 stars the movie rating had been before i bought it. Dont buy it! It's not worth the money or the time you will spend watching it.Anybody can write a plot like that. ...There is no soundtrack to this thing. There were times i could not take the voice of the main character anymore and had to fast forward...."
0," Buyers beware!!!!: These give false positives...after loosing my son in July at 17 wks and then ttc since sept, it is hard when you get your hopes up when you see a nice line on your wondofo...then later find out after several positives that is neg. I know some people say that I might have had a chemical, but no....it didn't even detect my pregnancy this cycle yet clear blue digital did. The lot # that I have is W00120694-3 exp 06/2014"
0," Mysterious Skin: I was quite appauled at some of the scenes and found the theme quite disturbing, a little too graphic at times."
1," It works well enough for scientific work: I have used this for close to a year now.... It some of the problems I have read in the other reviews like the switch being a pain.... and the lines getting lighter..... But both were curable ...the switch ...cured by taking off the ""decorative knob"" and just using the original slide switch.... sometimes the marketing guys get TOO fancy.... and the changing of intensity was cured by just cleaning the contacts on the battery compartment.... We searched all over for a 90 degree intersect with one line extending both ways and it is virtually impossible to find in the pro area or DIY area.... many 90 intersect with one line meeting another at right angles but not a perpendicular on a line. My last one got damaged when it fell from a scaffold and tried to buy another and no one had any left..... found it again here on Amazon and ordered two...just in caseRon SauroNWAA Labswww.nwaalabs.com"
0," Game Converter Complete Junk!: I recieved the blue one pictured (Dilong pu203). I've had the hardest time with this converter and couldn't get it to work if my life depended on it.I wish I could have given this thing 0 stars!On both of my computers (Windows XP, Vista) w/ working USB ports the controller was not correctly recognized or not recognized at all (as if not there). I've tried to install all kinds of different drivers from the CD, deleting them again, installing otheres. I've also tried to find a solution online and download a driver from the official Dilong website. -No success!I could not even open the read-me file as my MS Word program would shut down!As of today, I never got it to work on either Windows XP or Vista. It's a piece of junk! Please save your time and money and look for something else.Additional Note:Bought a ""Super Dual Box Pro"" now from ebay seller. Converter works perfectly on XP and Vista - just plug and play. Works fine with 2 PS2 controller and emulators."
1," sick and twisted: Imagine a twisted version of clutch, tuned WAY low and pumping out massive chunks of groove, filled in with growls of hangmen, pirates, and human heads by a crazy looking dude called Ironlung. Brilliant."
0," Disaster: The seller never call me back, and the device never workI need my money come back. 786 262 9966"
1, Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS BOOK STARTED OFF A SMASH! I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF SUSPENSE KEPT ME GUESSING. I THINK THAT EVERY FEMALE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT MAY HIT HOME.I GAVE THIS BOOK FOUR STARS BECAUSE AT THE END THE AUTHOR DRAGGED THE CONCLUSION. THE AUTHOR NEVER SAY WHAT HA[[ENED TO OTHER CHARACTERS.THANKS KEYANNA
1," Great Web Cam: Great video and easy to use, at least for me. I have only used it with XP so don't know how it would be with Vista. This is the first web cam I have used. Sound is OK. I would recommend it for the price."
0, Time will tell: Time will tell if this product is worth the price paid. The plastic connectors that support the frame seem cheap and poorly made. One arrived broken in half. The upper frame was bent. Both had to be replaced and that took 3 weeks. I'm concerned about the supports coming apart with use. We'll see.
0," OK for miscellaneous knives, not for the GOOD stuff!: I also have to echo the comments of other reviewers when saying if you have inexpensive, common cutlery this sharpener will work OK. If you have Chef's Quality cutlery don't bring it near this machine. It leaves a rough edge no matter which stone you use and simply isn't meant for good quality knives. If you paid a couple of hundred dollars or more for your set of kitchen knives, get them professionally sharpened. If you have run-of-the-mill cutlery this machine will do OK."
1," Serves its purpose: The potty seat is very compact and easy to fold. It is a bit unsturdy, however, and therefore one might accidentally might come in contact with the toilet seat. Previously, I had posted a review for this potty seat that asked how this product was supposed to stay clean, considering that it touched public toilet seats. Someone replied to my posting and suggested that a paper toilet seat cover or toilet paper can be put under the potty seat to keep the potty seat cleaner. The potty seat can then be carried in a plastic bag and thoroughly cleaned at home. This is a wonderful solution to the problem."
1, A Must Have!: This CD is perfect for any Staind fan as well as anyone that just likes great music. A decade of favorites and some excellent acoustic tracks from the Hiro Ballroom are included in this collection making this disc an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. I say it is a must have and I encourage anyone to pick it up.
0," product was - fair (came off fast); customer service - TERRIBLE: Bought this product and it immediately started to peel from my baby's new crib. I responded right away and customer service told me they'd get me a replacement tape to try to re-adhere product because my baby had been waking with paint all over his mouth and face (since the strip had come up). THREE MONTHS and many, many e-mails later NOTHING has been done. The product they said they'd mail as a replacement never ever came. Terrible, TERRIBLE customer service. And my baby has eaten off most of the paint on his crib rail."
0," As impressive as cheese!: D@mn, put a little makeup on him and keep him outta the fat suit and Martin Lawrence makes a fine looking woman! Unfortunatley not amount of LSD can make me think he has anything to say, 'bout as manufactured and souless as it gets. Go back to making those fabulous movies Martin and forget about the teenpop. We can't all be divas."
1," The Mighty Mighty Dells: I love this CD. I have the original ""Oh What A Nite"" on the Vee-Jay label. I still play this album alot. My favorite song is ""Why Do You Have To Go"". The Dells back then showed the world how talented they were back then THey wrote mostly all of the songs on thier debut album. Of course the classic ""Oh What A Night"" stand on its own. This is for doo-wop lovers only. Vee-Jay records had the best in thier fold."
1, MIRACLE BLADE: The absolute best set of knives I have ever purchased. It is everything that you see on all of the advertisements. If you need a good set of knives at a very reasonable price got for this.
1," !!! EYE FO AN EYE, TOOF FO A TOOF !!!: SPM TEARS IT UP ONCE AGAIN ON THIS ALBUM. FOR THE MOST PART, EVERY SONG THE SPM CREATES, IS YET ANOTHER GATEWAY INTO THE FIERY HELL HE CALL HIS HOOD. BEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM IN MY OPINION IS RIDDLA ON THA ROOF, BUT EVERY TRACK HOLDS ITS OWN ON DIS ONE TO FOR ONE MEAN, HOT OFF THE STREETS ALBUM THAT'LL GRAB YOU FROM THE MINUTE YOU PUT IT INTO YOUR STEREO. IF YOU HAVENT HEARD THE MEXICAN, THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM TO START WITH."
0," while the item seems high quality, it fails early.: This cable had all of the high end features one would want, braided cable, gold plated contacts, and so forth. And, well, the thing failed within a couple months. Now I replaced it with the cheapest piece of junk that Amazon carries and that lasted way longer, and it provided a better quality (or as good) picture.I would not spend my money on these overpriced, underperforming cables. Sorry.The items are only warrantied if they are purchased from a licensed dealer. Unless you are sure that this reseller is such a dealer, I wouldn't risk it. And I would save my receipt."
0," Not worth the buy: This product is not worth the buy. I agree w/ the above seller: installiation is a nightmare. Disk changer doesn't work w/ exsisting equiptment. made a purchase of this from ship2you, they eagerly took the $$$ from my account, but where in no big hurry to credit my account 2 1/2 months after i sent the product back. Im still waiting for a refund. The product is big & bulky & doesn't fit if you have limited space to put it in. Not worth all the $$ to ship it back, the headaches, and an installation nightmare, unless your an installation expert..."
1, Great tunes: Great voice singing great timeless songs. I highly recommend this CD is you like this genre. Allegheny Moon is an all time favorite.
1," needs revamping: The product works fine, at least the hot dog part. Personally I haven't used the bun warmer. Why don't they revamp this product so you can make 6-10 hot dogs and leave out the bun warmer? I love the convenience of popping the hot dogs down and having them ready in minutes, but making only 2 at a time seems less than ideal. My other complaint is it seems it wouldn't be that big of a deal to make the opening a little bigger so larger hot dogs would not get stuck. Only the smallest hotdogs fit, and those are harder to find nowdays when everything is jumbo size. Someone should reinvent this thing. I'd gladly spend more for a bigger one, especially given the price of other hot dog makers."
0," Digital 101: If you're looking for an affordable way to test out a digital camera, this is a good place to start. This very portable camera (about the size of a credit card) does perform the basic tasks. The software program is fairly simple, and if you are computer literate, you will have little trouble navigating it. Outdoor shots are better suited to this product, although with good indoor light a quality photo can be achieved. Enough pixels to e-mail a decent photo. Overall, a good starter camera for the money."
0," Needs much better instructions: I would suggest that only those that are really good with tools and gadgets order this product. The instructions are extremely limited with all these little ""figure this and figure that"" pictures. It was just annoying, and I could never get the blade in its place to even see how this product worked. The only reason I won't just flat out suggest that it's a bad purchase is because perhaps others are more mechanically inclined than I."
0," Don't waste your money: This book was plain horrible, it didn't help me at all.Go for the similarly topic-ed book by Delphine Hirsh...MUCH BETTER!"
0," Garbage: An absolute piece of trash. In real life, the actual Belka and Strelka were left out in space to suffocate when their oxygen fan out. Much like Disney's Pocahontas, Anastasia and others, this is just another piece of historical filtration for the sake of brainless entertainment.Graphics are third rate at best. Script is ludicrous. It gets worse from here!"
1," Fun Easter Book: This book is based on the song ""She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain"" and kids love it. If you get the audio CD with the music, they even have more fun."
0, Base station fails as it says here!!!: The phone was OK while it worked. I have two extra handsets that are useless exactly a week after my one year warranty is over because the base station is dead. I should've read reviews here before my purchase. I am trying to salvage my other handsets by buying another base on ebay...hopefully for less than $30.
0," Don't waste your Money: There is not much I can say about this feature, I asumed it would be about the Thunderbolt. I don't know where I got that idea. It was actually about a P47 group based in Italy. Other than a few interesting gun camera shots I found it boring propaganda for the folks at home. Possibly it was exciting in the 1940's but not today."
0," smells bad: I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews...unfortunately, the negative reviews regarding smell were right on. It smelled like permanent solution and did nothing for my hair."
1, another superb outing.: this is another superb ouiting by Higgins. Great fun all around. What an ending! very exciting!
1," Best book I have ever read.: my all time favorite! a great, gripping read with a nail-bitting climax! a must read for any Clancy fan (or any literate person for that matter! ) Books don't come better than this!"
1," HOLIDAY MUST HAVE: Let me just get in line with everyone else who loves this DVD. I am so happy I bought it. I plan to have it on as background during a holiday dinner and I just know that everyone will love it. Bright, beautiful scenes with ""jazzy"" music just puts you in a ""glowing"" mood. The price is so fair that everyone should grab a copy. I bought the first edition and then immediately saw that there was this one. Go with Christmas Lights 2 as the first one pales in comparison to this one.I can't imagine what edition #3 would look like but I'd probably buy that one too. Also love the music..jazz or country you can take your pick it just is perfect. Happy Holidays!"
0, Not a mystery at all...: I had guessed who the murderer was after about the first couple chapters but kept reading thinking there had to be a twist - which never came.
1," A rewarding love story: Nicolas Sparks never fails to deliver to his readers. This small town born client fell in love with the home town theme of characters, atmosphere and vivid imagery portrayed in every nook of this book. Although easily predictable, I was still carried through with ease and warmth as I turned each page of the story. I love the truth to the ending, good things can come out of bad situations. A ""lifes' lesson"" we all need to think about. Tomorrow always turns a page in our own lifes' story. Nicholas Sparks is always an inspirational read. Enjoy!"

1, Message Parallel Bible: This Bible is one of the best I have used. I like being able to see both translations side by side. Sometimes I like the NIV translation especially in Psalms but the Message speaks in terms I recognize and relate to. It speaks clearly and there is no misunderstanding the message.
0," Many Duplicates: This CD is pretty good Sleepy LaBeef music, but I already had Flying Saucers Rock 'n Roll and all but a handful of tracks are duplicates. If you already have LaBeef's Flying Saucers R&R, not worth getting this one."
1," Entertaining and Inspiring: This is the story of Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherds, who fight to save endangered sea life around the world. Corrupt Japanese whalers who ignore the law and hunt whales in protected seas are the focus of the Sea Shepherds in this series. Very inspiring to see these volunteers put their lives on hold travel to the antartic whale sanctuary to protect the whales from the criminal Japanese whalers who ignore the law and kill endangered whales. Highly recommended!"
0, Fooled Again: I bought this magazine with high hopes and was disapointed. Thinking I may have just got a bad issue I bought another one next month. I was disapointed again. Pretty pictures but no real content. The magazine is just cashing in on the Simplicity movement and really has nothing to do with it. IT is just another glorified Fashion/Design magazine. On top of this it stated that Breastfeeding was a waste of time. Any magazine that states my children are a waste of time is not going to be part of my household reading. I strongly suggest this magazine be by-passed.
1, CSVAT CV31: Great Device. Would like to have known that it has RCA inputs and not BNC. Which means that if you have a DVR thats accepts BNC type connections you will have to purchase a gender changer for conversion. This can be pricey if you purchase the gender changers from RADIO Shack for multiple cameras. I ended up purchasing mine on line. Picture Quality is Great and night vision is not to bad either. if not going wireless I would recommend it in fact I am planning on purchasing another One.
0," Too much wrong: The JWIN JTP570WHT I received is almost totally faulty. The speaker-phone volume can't be raised enough, and the 'Store' and 'Auto' functions don't work!"
1," Great Vacuum: I ordered one of these for my Mom. It did such a good job that I ordered one for myself. It's light, easy to handle and has great suction power even with floor tools. I only found 2 slight drawbacks: the bag is small and therefore needs to be changed more frequently; and the hose for the onboard tools is short. However, I ordered the extended hose which works just fine. The performance greatly outweighs the minor inconveniences."
1," Compact design makes it easy to keep handy: I work in a group home where I'm required to cook regularly. The knives aren't maintained well, and I happily bring my own sharpener to improve the edge before I get to my slicing and dicing. Of course I use it at home as well, who wouldn't? I like the fact that I can slip it into my work bag, and will forget it is there until I need it! There may be better sharpeners out there, but if you need something small to keep with you (or maybe to put with camping gear?) I would recommend this little item."
1," I Rate it High...But!: I bought this in December 2007. Works real well....BUTthey went bankrupt, chapter 11 July 2008! So if you buy one you have no warranty as warranties are a liability and they are removed with bankruptcy! I bought an extended warranty like a jerk and I am out that dough. All I can do is watch and enjoy what I have and if it fails, who knows what to do. Parts may not be available, but thay have been bought out by a company calling themselves; ""Olevia International Group.""I do not know IF they will honor warranties from the original defunct company. Amazon should post the fact that ""Olevia"" is chapter 11.Unsettled times!"
0, Rubbish battery again: Battery lasts 5 hours if played immediately after charging. Loses 50% charge after 5 hours switched off. Loses 100% charge left switched off for 24 hours.During tests the equaliser was off - backlight set 10 secs - was on HOLD. One long playlist selection time less then 30 secs. Battery fully recharged before each test.Amazon are brilliant and have sent a replacement immediately.It is annoying that Mr. Jobs cannot learn after his serial quality problems causing inconvenience all over the place.
0," Yawn.: This book proves the case that some reads are far better abridged, than unabridged. Repetitious, boring, tedious, rambling and, did I mention, repetitious and rambling? In the end, too many unanswered questions to situations mentioned over and over in the book, but never explained. Also, time travel can be a tricky thing, but at the very end of the book, the use of a ""locator"" has to be the icing on the cake. They didn't have satellites back in 1348 to my knowledge. Two stars would be too generous."
0," Deceptive Sales Tactic - No Widescreen Versions: The movies are great, but these reviews are also about the product itself and this Double Feature product sucks because it says it contains the Widescreen versions of the films, but it does not - it only has the full screen versions. If you're a big DVD buff, this will not be good enough for you as it was not for me!"
1," Excellent Game for You: This is an excellent game for any fams of Spiderman, X-men, or Marvel comics. Awesome replay ability."
1," works great for me.: I bought this for my grandson because he sleeps on the outher side of the house, about 100ft away,and we get very clear reception. No static or other sounds at all.Very happy with this purchase."
0," no motivation from this garbage: This woman's main problem isn't weight. She needs some serious therapy. I would rather weigh 300 pounds than have her attitude. Her self-loathing, and horrible remarks about how fat people eat, and tubs of lard are disgusting. She claims to be so religious, but I want no part of the kind of religion where it is okay to call yourself a ""tub of lard"" and malign others if they decide to practice fat acceptance. It might not be okay for her, but how dare she claim it isn't okay for others. How dare she put all fat people in the category of sinful tubs of lard who have disgusting rolls of fat. It was one of the saddest books I've ever read. I only have about 15 pounds to lose, but nothing about this woman inspires me. I just feel intense anger at her judgmental attitude."
1," Wow, what a GREAT film!: This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. It's a semi-documentary shot on location. That river the actors across to capture the skinner family is actually located in Kekexili, according to the National Geographic website on the film. The story is simple yet powerful. The ending is just incredible. A must-see.It's reported that only three of the actors in the film are pros: the reporter, the ringleader of the patrol, and the guy in the quicksand scene. The girl is really pretty; too bad she doesn't get much screen time.You owe it to yourself to see this memorable film."
0," Think twice before ordering: The reviews cautioning the newly diagnosed against this book -- and those pointing out it represents the approach of a very particular group of women with a very particular approach to MS -- have floated to the end of the list here. I think it's worth pointing out again that if you aren't into refering to your disease as a ""MonSter"", and are trying to expand your horizons beyond your disease, this isn't the book to get.For those new to MS, this book may be scary: is this the only future open to me? The inspid cuteness may be as terrifying as the disbility!One thing that really bothers me is the suggestion here that people who want to understand women with MS should read this book. This is not the only face of MS. I'm glad the ""froup"" has helped these women. MS is a rough go, and it's good not to go it alone. But you know, faced with the choice between going solo and ""froupping"", I'd pick solo everytime!"
0," Horrible Drill: This is the worst drill I have ever owned, been Framing / Contracting for a very long time, 10+ years, and this is the worst drill ive ever seen.Works fine in SDS mode, but when you change the chuck to drill ""normal"" wood and holes, this drill just has no power. The changeable chuck slips constantly and cannot use medium to large bits, the drill stalls out and you hear the slipping sound. Been into local dewalt repair shop twice, and they cant do a thing with it.DO NOT BUY"
0, THIS MOVIE SUCKS: I rented this movie over the weekend And it has to be the worst movie of the year. this movie takes forever to get moving and when the snakes finely show up. you can tell the sanks are so fake they are eather ruber snakers or made by a computer. and the acting sucks I thing it's the worst film Samuel L. Jackson has ever done.
0, Very Difficult: Got this off of a recommendation and had trouble with it from the beginning. Had to reset it at least once a day and I couldn't print wirelessly. Bad customer service as well. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
0," the worst software ever: I recently purchased a new computer. The dictionary/thesaurus software I had been using for several years did not work very well with the new computerand windows 7. I had been looking for something new and updated; I thought the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus would be a good choice and Amazon as usual offered a good price. I was wrong on my choice of software. I spent over four hours trying to get it loaded and getting it to work. I have twenty-five years with computers, both at work and at home; I have never experienced this much trouble with any other software in the past fifth-teen years. After four hours of total frustration I gave up, called Amazon and complained. The Amazon representative was quick to arrange for a return of the product and a credit for my purchase. Merriam-Webster gets a one star, only because that is the lowest offered; Amazon.com gets five stars for not adding further to the problem. Thank you Amazon.com."
0," very disappointing performance: sounded like these blades were exceptional, so I ordered a package. My experience is that they simply don't cut. Thought maybe the first one was a factory defect, but worked through all of them and found that NONE of the blades in this pack cut. Tried them in my battery-powered recip, and in the 110 volt recip -- they don't cut. The cheap blades that I got at Big Lots cut a LOT faster and more cleanly. So much for getting what you pay for."
1," The Rat Zapper Works. Really well.: We have now had our rat zapper for a year and it is still working perfectly. We LOVE the rat zapper. Right now its count is at 14 rats zapped. It is easy to use, very efffective, and very easy to dispose of the rats. It was expensive, but for me it was totally worth not messing with glue traps or snap traps ever again."
0," mr. uncle tom...: rev.peterson is nothing more than a glorified house negro.it,s sickening and embarassing to read the trash that thisself-hating blackman has written about his own race.granted the fact that there are black leaders that do exploittheir people,so does other leaders of the various races.rev. peterson is a blackman who,s racist towards his ownblack people.his white southern conservative points of view are definitelyku klux klanistic.black men like peterson do more damage to the black racethan any white hate group."
0," Bad software: Provided sofware doesn't work with Windows 98 / XP. Unable to get the adapter to work with Win 98.Using XP its reliability is very low: random software errors. I've got it to work using XP own wireless control software, not the Belkin one provided."
0, didn't last: I bought one of these in June. By October's end it stopped working. It was never dropped and was only used about 10 times. Warranty is only good for 90 days. I expected more from Memorex. Guess I need to buy extended warranties on everything.
0," Tis--Trash: What a major disappointment. I could not believe this was the work of the same author of Angela's Ashes. I could find no portion of this book where one would not have to wade through the gutters of New York, all due to the filthy language that is so very distracting. How sad that such a brillian man and author would have to stoop to such rot to sell a book. Not only have I lost all respect for him as a writer, but as a gentleman as well. I will be returning it as quickly as I am well enough to go to the post office."
0," Boring: I had heard alot about this release, and within the first minute of listening, really began to wonder what all the fuss was about. Boring, boring, boring....that's what I think of this CD. Yundi Li's smooth passagework was admirable, but he restricts himself to a small dynamic range better suited to Bach. In addition, he seems to play everything in straight time. No rubato, none! If you're looking for a good recording of the Third Sonata, try Kissin or Demidenko; both play it with far more passion and panache. For the Nocturnes - Moravec or Pires, and for the Etudes - Lortie or Wild."
0, Ouch: I didn't like this movie at all for lots of reasons :1. The plot = totally confusing or rather senseless2. The screenwriting = totally unprofessional3. The acting = Excellent when you think how crap the whole thing was.4. The Everything about it.No offense people as I am Stephen King's huge fan.
1, Great Movie!: Great classic; wanted to purchase so we can add it to our collection of classic movies; also wanted our grandchildren to enjoy a great movie and they loved it
0," Nice watch, lousy band: I agree with many regarding the comfort and features of the watch, but the band is terrible. I didn't mind at first when the first one just got faded to a muddy shade of clay, but when the band lost grip of the watch I thought it was a singular problem. The second watch I bought to replace it separated band from watch before I even had time to complain about the color fading. Timex really needs to fix this problem!"
1," A unique voice: Melanie had a voice that can best described as distinctive. I call her the female Joe Cocker. If you like him, you'll love her. Her covers of such classics as ""Ruby Tuesday"" have to be heard to be appreciated. Her original hits like ""Beautiful People, "" ""Brand New Key,"" and ""Candles in the Rain"" are classics."
1," Condenzio has a written a real page turner: John Condenzio has written a page turner based on an actual ghostly happening. A writer comes to town wishing to be inspired by a gothic setting and meets several unusual characters. Condenzio had crafted strong, well written personalities, each having met the spectral visitor. Inspired scenes throughout make this a strong addition to anyone interested in the horror, retro-gothic, of ghost genres. The uniqueness is the telling opf the full story in a tripartite series of 'novellas-within-a-book'. If you liked M.R. James or even Stephen King's early ghostly tales, this one is a gotcha."
1," A well-written story of well-known events to us Salemites: This book is a nail-biter much in the same way that ""The Perfect Storm"" was to all of us who lived through the Blizzard of '78 and then the No-Name Storm of October 1991. Actually, it is so well-written it would be a nail-biter to anyone I would think. What I like the most is that the author makes people that I only knew about through the news stories at the time come to life. They are real, brave and you want it to have a happy ending, even though life doesn't work that way sometimes. Highly recommended."
0," Where's the beef in the preview?: The preview provides access to lots of the ""nice stories"". The value lies in understanding the range of meanings associating with each of these scenarios or stories. There does not appear to be one preview of these discussions. Each scenario also associates with a set of rather banal questions that do little to stimulate an inquiring flexibility of mind to the complex topics raised. Few things are the dichotomies inferred here.A book to purchase? I don't know and likely will look elsewhere for offerings with more visible substance."
1," Children's Book for Adults: I bought this book for my toddler, but the art work was so extraordinary and the prose so poetic, that I showed this book to my mom, who's an author and an artist. She ended up permanently ""borrowing"" this book, that I gladly ordered another copy. The sophistication of this book is such that it takes a person with mature artistic sensibilities to appreciate it in full. Buy two copies, one for your kids to chew on (literally and figuratively) and another for you to cherish."
1," Not Bad, Why Complain?: I don't have a clue why everyone seems to down on this band. They're not bad, sound entertaining, and for a punk band, YES, can play their instruments and can sing, so what's wrong?Nothing!Enjoy, if you like face to face, descendents, etc, you WILL like this band.Peace From the Mid-East,Jickie"
0," just plain awful: Set this up on a desktop running Windows 2000 and a laptop running Windows XP. The setup utility that came with the linksys was just awful, it was difficult to setup, the configuration did not work with XP, and new drivers were needed that still don't work properly.By comparison, an install with dlink went seemlessly and has performed without fault from the start. In my opinion, I'd go with the d-link everytime..."
1," Simple installation and use: I purchased three of these to bring a rental home up to county code in which it would have been nearly impossible to run a single wire for the standard interconnected alarms. The alarms are as simple to install as standard A/C smoke alarms, and the wireless interconnectivity avoids unnecessary running of new wire.The one caveat is the instructions included with the unit are not well-written, and you might think you have to wire these the same as hardwired interconnected. That is only true if you are connecting wireless interconnected alarms to an existing hardwired interconnected system: one of the wireless has to be hardwired to the existing system.And, of course, make sure your installation meets all the electrical code requirements of your municipality!"
0," Mmmmm, I don't think so!: As a student of GSA (Glasgow school of Art), I am perhaps in the best position to comment on such a subject. It seems to me that if Mr. Mackintosh ever visited the school , he did so with his eyes closed. He has completly missed the point of the building. Radically undestating its importance and beauty. Most of all I feel that it is truly hurtful the way in which he described the ""menial nature"" of the staff which enhabit this fine establishment. Although the text itself is completly removed from the reality the pictures are sweet."
0, HO HUM: I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT BETTER.THE MAN THING THAT BUGGED ME IS STURAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHILD MOUSE SO WHY USE A ADULTS VOCIE. THERE WAS ONE PART A LIKED THOUGH ANDD THAT WAS THE PART WHEN THE ONE CAT SMILED AND SAID PLEASE. ALSO WHY DOES EVERY THINK JOTHAN LIPNICK IS SO CUTE. HE NOT THAT GREAT.
0," Those With Good Ears Need Not Apply: I chose this unit mainly because I had read that it was quiet. If you're looking for a bedroom application, forget it. This thing gurgles continuously, and is actually quit obnoxious while you're laying in bed trying to get to sleep. I finally got up and shut it off. This ""con"" (along with it being kind of pricey) makes any ""pros"" irrelevent as far as I'm concerned, so I have nothing good to say about the item."
1," Music: Love the music of this band, they should of done more music like this, Turning Japanese is a cool song."
0," Stooge-style slapstick is way below par for the series: This late Blondie entry (1949) has Dagwood as a clumsy laborer on a construction site. The director of this film usually wrote and directed Three Stooges comedies, and it shows. The obvious slapstick doesn't fit the ""Blondie"" situation-comedy format at all. Arthur Lake as Dagwood does his best with the material, and there are a few laughs, but fans of the series will probably be disappointed. Try another episode first."
1," Honey Oak is more of a cherry...but overall fantastic: I love the fact that you literally unfold the bookcase right out of the box... no assembly required. Fantastic. It is good wood, put together well, and the finish is smooth and even throughout. The only thing is that the color Honey Oak looks more like a cherry than the oak in the picture... but that is okay for my needs."
0," HOR402264B - Poly Lined Black Swirl Design Carafe: I'm very disappointed with this product. One of the main reasons I purchased it was for its volume. Most of the other thermal carafes were too small for my needs. However, this carafe keeps coffee hot for only a short time. I will not purchase any more of this company's product."
1," A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT: This book is wonderful. I think it is the best one Ms McMillian has written yet. The characters are so real and I can see many families going through the same thing. I love the book, one miunte I was laughing out loud, the next I was crying my eyes out. Although the story holds your interest with the interaction of characters the ending blows you away. I have already pasted this book on to several friends and we all believe this is just another movie waiting to come to life. My hat is off to you Ms McMillian."
1, If there is one book to have about CSS this is the one: Even for advanced user this book can provide a wealth of information. From building table-less web page to the workarounds for various browsers. This book has it all.
0," Highly unsatisfied: I had left a gift message along with it. The most important thing of all, and that's one that wasn't included despite me checking the gift option and leaving a message. Highly disappointed."
1," Very happy with product: I got this fountain for my birthday this year and i love it. It was very easy to assemble and has a nice sound to it when it is running. I like the soft candle like glow and the stones are nice as well. If you look too closley it does look a little cheap, but i cannot find a flaw with how it works. Overall i highly recommend it"
0," Sketchy navel gazing: Nostalgia run rampant, without connective tissue or narrative propulsion, this is perhaps something that the author's kin might find worth perusing at some later date, but hardly more than that. I'd recommend something by one of the Wolff brothers if you want to see how it's truly done."
0," A Single Man: I bought this without reading the reviews, just on the fact that Colin Firth is the star. That was a mistake. It was boring. Don't waste your money!"
0," A Boring off-topic book.: First of all, the book Is about a boy named jim and a girl named Antonia. Short and simple, its off topic, barelly mentions antonia, and describes the same details over and over and over makeing it long and repetitive. If you like romance novels, you might like it, but just to let you know, the only reason i even picked up the book was for a school class."
1," A top pick: DANCE OFF THE INCHES: CARDIO HIP HOP comes from Jennifer Galardi, who offers fresh new dance steps for both fans of her original DVD and those new to the series. Three dance routines provide fine total body workouts based on the hip hop dance routines she's developed. A top pick."
0," Self-Indulgent and Overrated: Anyone who can compare this to good glam rock or the Stones must not have listened to that great music very carefully. From its overdone beginning songs, to the self-indulgent suicide ballad, to the lyrically trite ""Texture of A Girl,"" the album's few interesting/fun moments are ruined by it's sad attempts at depth. My message: stick to real glam rock, not this sad, shallow imitation."
0," NOT A GERBER: ok as a multi-tool: This IS NOT A GERBER BRAND MULTI TOOL!!!!It is cheap price for what it is.The one that I receive did not have the main blade sharpened at all, it was blank."
1," absolutely awesome: I have listened to this CD over and over and I just cannot get enough. My favorite tune is Night Crawler, but the rest of the songs are superb as well. I just wish I could find guitar tablature for all his tunes. His style of playing is what I aspire to."
1," great book: Great book, this book breaks down abuse in small sections so its easy to understand. Also she uses examples of sessions so its easier to identify with others."
1," Not A Calculus Made Easy, But A Good Book: There is no doubt in my mind that this book is not supposed to be similar to Silvanus Thompson's Calculus Made Easy or books of that sort, rather this book is a literary journey through calculus that is not meant to teach you how to do it, but more or less teach you how it was brought about. I found the book to be verbose at times, but on the whole, decent reading material."
0," Broken!: We put this item on our gift registry and received it as a wedding gift last year. It worked wonderfully for about nine months, and after that it rapidly deteriorated until finally it wouldn't turn off and tried to brew coffee with no water all by itself, leaving us with a smoking coffeemaker and a scorched coffeepot. When I called Applica, they informed me that they would not honor the 1-year warranty because the product had apparantly sat on the shelf for a year before it was purchased, unbeknownst to us or to the person who gave it to us.My advice--stay away from Black & Decker! They used to be a good name, but with their policy of not honoring warranties, that good name shouldn't last for long!"
1," Great adventure for first-time players: One of the finest and rarest adventures for Basic D&D! It's so much fun to play through that I've begun many AD&D campaigns here (the conversion is simple). The mage Kavorquian (hehe!) has fallen, and his legacy must be recovered from his mysterious stronghold, and bequeathed to the rightful heir. Easy, right? If you only knew... ;) Can be used as the sequel to B11, or by itself, for levels 1-3."
1," generally excellent but one flaw so far: Love the steam features and the ease of use, but wish the cover where the cord goes into the back of the iron were longer and stronger. Too often the cord winds up under the iron instead of behind it."
0," Don't Bother: This book is what happens when a would-be author spots a growing trend and wants to cash in on it. The ""recipes"" are dreary, unimaginative, slightly altered retreads of what we've found in other (better!) books, and many are little more than ponderously described descriptions of how to prepare the basics that are already staples in our kitchens. If you want something really worthwhile, purchase Fran McCullough's ""The Low-Carb Cookbook,"" and hope that someone else of that caliber, ingenuity, and integrity, writes another book of that sort. This one isn't it."
0," gave me a migraine: All the flashing around from one scene to the next, horrible lighting, etc...where was the band? I'd rather plug myself into an electrical socket while standing next to a sprinkler than watch this video that gave me nothing but severe pain and visual disturbance. Retch!"
1," Don't Pick Up Hitch-hikers!!: Frank Lovejoy and Edmond O'Brien go on a fishing trip, but end up the hostages of William Talman, a hitch-hiker who has already killed other drivers, on a trip to Mexico where Talman wants to escape the authorities. The film is short, at seventy minutes, but that keeps the action moving right along. It's tightly edited, and the viewer gets a very real sense of the confinement of the two men. A lot of credit goes to director Ida Lupino, who establishes a mood of tension and desperation, as well as to the fine trio of actors who are all memorable in their roles. It's a smart thriller that will grab your attention and keep it to the very end."
0, Very slow!: Could not find a way to read or print the manual. Action very slow! Went into a pause mode constantly and finally gave up. Junk product in my opinion.
0," Do not get this book for a sensitive/anxious child!: This book can be very disturbing for a child who is sensitive or anxious. I am a child therapist and it sent one of my clients into extreme anxiety after the parents got it for him. It took him over a year to get over his fears of something bad happening to his body, that stemmed directly from this book. I wouldn't get it for any child."
1," THE NEW GROOVE: Hot Hot Hot!!! This is one of the hottest Cd's i've bought this summer. What an excellent arrangement of rap & merengue. I knew I was hooked when I first heard ""EL CABALLITO"" and the AND WHEN I BOUHT THE C.D. THE NEXT SONG THAT MADE ME GO NUTS WAS MUELA. BUY IT THESE BOYS ARE OF THE HOOK."
0," This is Tool?: I love Tool. They are a great band. Maynard is a good singer. Adam is a good guitarist, Daney is a good drummer...blah blah blah...This cd is horrible!First, they picked No Quarter, not the greatest Zeppelin song to cover....bad choiceThe rest of these songs seem to be just randomness, like Message To Harry Manback 2, or some of this other new stuff that seems unidentified and hard to get used to.The only reason i even gave this 2 stars is because the c.d. has Pushit which is a really good song, and the DVD has their music videos (which are all amazing), but no live stuff.....don't bother, pick up their 3 other cds, all 5 star work."
1, fun to learn: This is a great book-has been helping me quite a bit. Still working through it but making progress. Can't wait to try it out in Italy!
1, Mr. Crabs: I purchased this beanie babie for my grandson. He loves the color Red and loves this toy. It was exactly as described. I'm happy with my purchase.
1," Provides a new dimension to the education process.: Janet Levine's book, ""The Enneagram Intelligences"" is a very welcome addition to the world of education. I found the material comprehensible, very readable, and applicable to all levels of education from grade school to corporate training. I highly recommend the book to all my corporate clients."
1," overall good phones: I haven't heard other in-ear phones that fall into the same class as these, such as Shure E4C or Westone UM2, but overall they seem to be a good bang for a buck. I previously owned Etymotic ER6i and I only after buying these phones discovered that they are also made by Etymotic Labs. Fortunately sound is nothing like Etys, it has much more bass but still has that good treble of Etys. It only had triflanges and foam tips included, but fortunately foam tips are just for my ears. Also, I'm thinking of removing the pod, that should considerably improve the sound, here's link to tutorial[..........]"
0, 100 lbs. draw is bull: I purchased this crossbow as a gift for my girlfriend because I bought a 80 lbs. cobra crossbow for myself and loved it. I saw that this model was a mini compound so I knew she could draw it easier than mine so I got it. We test fired it against a laminated particle board. It wouldn't even stick an alluminium bolt into it. My 80 lbs. bow would bury any bolt fired at it 1/2 inch deep. All in all it is a fun toy but the 100lbs draw is a farce. I did take the red dot sight from it and put it on my cobra crossbow and nail bullseyes all day long.
0, Littermaid cat privacy tent: Doesn't fit the littermaid box...waste of money! Thinking of getting another litter system entirely! Very disappointed in the quality of the product.
1," I liked this bit of fun historical fiction: Okay, some of this is not 100% provable, a bit is anachronistic, and the author's years of modern Regular Army experiences probably add a specific tint to the colorful tale, but all in all, this is a really good read, and well worth adding to your library. The Christian reader will appreciate the biblical verses that tie this work into the era and location, while the secular reader will still recognise that the author has done a great deal of research and produced a very good book!"
1, Starflyer 59 is impressive: The Holiday Song has the best music of any song released in recent years! Starflyer 59 is an underrated band that can really perform.
1," It DOES work with Windows 7 64-bit: I originally bought four VOIP321 phones to run on an XP PC, and they have proved very reliable. I recently upgraded to a Windows 7 64-bit PC, and discovered that W7 wouldn't start VOIP321 as a sound device (showing a yellow exclamation mark under Devices). So I took the advice of 13roots from this thread (confirmed by posters on several other websites), and installed a VIA VT6212L chipset PCI card (2.95 including postage from ebay in the UK) and used it to connect my VOIP321 hub to the PC. It now works perfectly with the latest Skype 4.1 software. Please spread the word.Note that for W7, I used the VOIP321 Vista installation application run in Vista SP2 compatibility mode."
1," Awesome Highs: One must give this record ample listening space within which to impress -- otherwise you might jump to the erroneous conclusion that it falls short of Turin's awesome debut LP. Not so.The sonic highs and wild passionate moments on Ether's best songs catapult it beyond the Optimist both in depth and scope.It's pointless to list favorite songs, although ""Average Man,"" ""Stone Thrown,"" ""Rain City,"" and the gorgeously layered hidden track are tunes I can (and do) listen to over and over again.Play it loud . . . ."
0, Pass this one up: I just couldn't get into the story. It was confusing. Not as well written as his other books. I was disappointed.
0," Can things get any worse?: This has less than nothing to do with I Spy which was cool and clever. Even Roger Ebert will have a tough time giving this a thumbs up.Two stars because Eddie manages to get off some funny lines while Owen Wilson sleepwalks--and who can blame him.What next, Hollywood? The Man From U.N.C.L.E. starring Adam Sandler?"

1," worth it for one song: ""this must be the place"" is not only the best song the heads ever recorded, it's one of the best songs you're ever going to hear. absolutely moving."
1, ready to sew: am begging scraps from all my quilting friends so i can start working on these scrap quilts. will try to start a scrap exchange in our local park club so we'll all have enough different pieces.
0, Piece of Garbage: This monitor worked well for the first week but by the second week I wanted to throw it away. The static is horrible. Do not purchase this monitor. I have since ordered a different manufacturer but I haven't received it yet so I don't know if it will be any better or not.
1," All That I Bleed: All That I Bleed rules!!! This guys have the sound that ""Dream Theater"" would love to have!! ""Dying To Remember"" it's an excellent album, it's the best debut album I've heard in my life. I though it wasn't gonna be the best thing, but when I heard it, it really was the best thing. This is the best progressive band I've ever heard. All the songs from the album are great!! ""Promise Of Life"" it's the best!! I can't wait to listen another album of ATIB. The have their original style, it's heavy, and Leonardo it's a great singer. ATIB withough Leonardo Rivera... won't be the same. Oscar it's the best guitarist I've heard, Jorge it's way to fast in the bass, and Carlos does a fast and excellent drumming!!! I compare drummer De Jesus with Mark Zone, they are both excellent. This is one album you must buy!! If you are a progressive metal fan, and you don't have this album, you have nothing cause this it's the best progressive metal band there is!!!!!"
1," Decent product: Not as good as the Remington Smooth and Silky razor that I used to own in regard to closeness of shave, but still decent. Battery stays charged well for multiple uses. Good for quick shave if I'm not caring about how smooth I'm going to feel and only about how hair-free I'm going to look."
1, sharp and easy: this knife is very sharp and cuts through anything you want and it is also efficient this knife should be good for skinning and gutting small game too
1," The ""Be Here Now"" of the 21st Century: ""The Lost Spiritual World: The Gospel of Mark"" is a multimedia spiritual extravaganza, a book that breaks through old technological and conceptual models of what a book can be. This commentary on the Gospel of Mark draws upon various strands of Christian theology, as well as the wisdom of other world religions. Whereas ""Be Here Now,"" published in 1971, drew us on a journey to the East and its contemplative wisdom, ""The Lost Spiritual World"" helps us to complete the circle, as many of us return to our cradle faiths, but liberated and enriched by what we have learned from other traditions. Experience this book! Better yet, buy one for yourself and several more for teenagers and young adults in your life who might be inspired by a fresh, non-dogmatic exploration of the heart of Christianity.Professor Stephanie PhillipsCenter for Law and Religious StudiesUniversity at Buffalo Law School"
1," The title summarizes the book pretty well !: I was a little shocked when i saw that only one FreeBSD book existed, but it covers all the aspects of the OS one might want to explore, it is truly satisfying, it helped me in moving from linux to FreeBSD totally painlessly."
1," Ambrosia for Novelists-To-Be: This is a superbly-written, user-friendly book for anyone who has ever had the whisper of an urge to write a book. Loaded with happy, helpful hints on how to prepare yourself to become a writer (from finding free time in your busy day to setting aside special ""writing"" clothes) and incredibly affirming encouragement, Baty's book is sure to entice the inner storyteller in any timid writer. Even veteran writers will enjoy revisiting of their experience of becoming novelists, however. I found myself grinning from ear to ear remembering my first novel attempt. I just loved this book!"
0," Caution: Their usual fun preformance, but note this CD has only 4 songs for 10 min. Little Mother-in-Law, You Are My, Anything But Love , and Wash Jones."
1, Country Music's Natural Voice!: What can anyone say about Merle Haggard that has not already been said? He has an awesome voice that brings for delightful country songs almost effortlessly. Years and years of quality songs and song writing that cannot be beat! High quality CD and a fair price. The delivery is super fast too!
0," A disappointment: Cold war thrillers are one of my guilty pleasures and I was expecting a little-known gem after reading the other reviews. But this book was somewhat of a disappointment.The dialogue seems forced and even stilted. For example, several Americans are asked to join a trip. After one accepts, another says, ""I, also, of course."" Now, have you ever heard an American say ""I, also"" instead of ""me, too""?The lead female character is also a problem. Almost none of her actions or dialogue rang true for me. She seemed liked nothing more than a clumsy device to move the plot along. If the plot required a tantrum, she threw a tantrum. What's worse, for a thriller, this book wasn't very, well, thrilling. The first half of the book seemed to drag, although it did pick up in the second half.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: I also disliked the ending, or should I say, the non-ending. When you stick with an author (or in this case, authors) for 307 pages, you deserve some sort of payoff."
1," THIS is the Black Dahlia!: At last I have had the opportunity to of discovereing who the Black Dahlia really was. Nothing else I have ever read comes close to the revelations contained in book, about the young woman, Elizabeth Short, known in Hollywood circles as the Black Dahila. This beautiful young woman suffered the most horrible death imaginable. Apart from this being one of the most horrendous and mysterious crimes in the history of Los Angeles (and certainly in the annals of modern crime), John Gilmore's book has opened for me the world of Elizabeth Short, young, exciting, yet strange and diffident. I cannot imagine another account that approaches as clear an understanding of the Black Dahlia, or of her tormented, secretive existance, her dreams, her desires, the yearning for fame that alwasy sadly slipped out of her reach. A fine, excellent book."
0," The Pits!: David Bradley replaces Michael Dudikoff as he prepares to do battle against a terrorist,in this pointless Sequal. Steve James is pretty good but this isn't even worth a rental."
0, Really bad: This dispenser was awful! It jammed and didn't pump out any soap even when I watered it down! I returned it!
1," Plain ones are boring: These are great crackers, and I wanted a variety to try them all. Only thing is, you get these really boring plain ones in the case--three packages of them! Oh well, next time I'll know better . . ."
1," Standing the test of time: I first purchased this CD in the early '90s and listen to it at least once a year, often more frequently than that. It has never lost its lush vitality, earthy sensuality and translucent spirit. I purchased this copy for a dear friend who was experiencing personal problems. Arlene Auger's voice visits from another sphere."
1," Great game for Warhammer fans!: This is the best thing since Warcraft and Starcraft. If you liked those you will love this game. It is well balanced, fun and easy to learn. Great for long hours of fun alone or with friends online! I heartily recommend it!"
1," This CD would have been incredible...IF............: Danny Joe Brown's vocals are barely audible except between tracks when he's talking. Whoever remastered this should have turned up the vocals a tad. If they had done this, I think this would have been one of the greatest live Southern rock concerts ever recorded."
0," Horrible waste of money: Battery life is weak.Phone is not user friendly, nor is it easily navigable.Ring tones available on phone are few and poor.Battery life is non existent after the phone is a year old. I have had friends who have warned me that the phone simply dies suddenly. I am noticing that the phone can fully charged and does not last more than a day with the following ""activity"": one twenty minute phone call, 5 text messages.It may be worth paying more in order to have a decent phone."
1," The best book Tolkien wrote: This book is what I think the greatest book Tolkien wrote. I read it once a year because there is so much to it. It starts with the creation of the world and Middle Earth. It goes deep into the history and myths of Middle Earth. Many stories mentioned in the Lord of the Rings books take place in the Silmarillion. This is not an easy book to read. I guess you can call it the ""bible"" of Middle Earth. But it is a very good book. Things in some of his other stories make more scence after getting the pieces The Silmarillion fills in."
1," Gorgeous Music!: I love the orchestral music of Bill Conti!What a shame his scores for the Karate Kid movies went unreleased.Everyone loves the first two movies, but the surprise is KK3 & KK4scores are breathtakingly beautiful. I spent $200 on the set and it'sworth every penny--great memories from the movies.The set features a CD case featuring the scores and a making of booklet.The music lasts about 3 hours and it's fascinating how Conti and Zamfir (pan flute)rework old themes into new masterpieces. A must have for any Karate Kid fan.Makes a great Christmas present.'"
1," A Look Closer...: American Beauty is a great movie that discovers how twisted America can be And what a beauty this is. Spacey is excellent as Lester Burnham, a disillusioned hack writer who embarks on a reckless quest for self-discovery. While alienating his control-freak wife (Annette Bening) and confused teenage daughter (Thora Birch), he jumps headfirst into his midlife crisis, befriending the drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley) and lusting after his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari), among other things. Director Mendes' uncommon approach to common realities is wonderful, and the script is full of pessimism and hilarity, with not a word wasted. Add to that the film's electric visual style, and what emerges is a terrific film about troubled souls. Musical score is just great with along with the theme and the thoughts of Lester Cunningham (Kevin Spacey). I would recommend it for anyone to se the realities of the American Beauty"
1," Excellent, but be fore-warned: These are excellent blackline reproductions of fine artwork, great for colored pencil coloring. However, not all the images are as saintly as the cover picture. Some are nudes or near nudes, so this is perhaps not the book for some young children."
0," Plastic gears finally broke, good riddance: I had this shredder for several years. It was cheap, but I wasted a lot of time feeding it 2-3 sheets at a time and emptying it after every couple of dozen sheets. I was never so happy when this shredder's internal plastic gears finally broke (now I can buy a REAL shredder). The bin was tiny, so it would fill up quickly and start to pull the clippings back into the blades and jam up, and then I had to flip it over and push down the shreddings and pull clumps of paper bits out of the blades. It made a mess on the carpet when lifting the top off to empty the bin, and paper dust flew into to air when putting the top back on. The only useful part of this shredder is the little grey waste-basket that I'm left with after putting the cutting head in the garbage (where it belongs)."
1," Samurai William: Giles Milton in Samurai William presents the story of a beautiful place full of culture and mystique and the Europeans who suit to use Japan as a resource for their own enrichment. William Adams, the man who opened Japan for the English and other European powers by using his influence over various Japanese officials to gain sweetheart trading deals. Using engaging prose and lively vivid descriptions that place the reader inside Japan as the Europeans enter, struggle against political and economic upheaval and eventually as the men leave Japan a defeated lot. It's a tale of men motivated by greed, men addicted to power in the case of some Japanese leaders, and even the blood lust that inhabits men that leads them to compel shoguns to evict Jesuits and then exploiting later religious and political divides in the drive for money."
1," superb drill!: I have owned several DeWalt drills as well as a few other brands and the Hitachi beats them all. In every catagory the Hitachi is a better drill and a better buy. Although it does not have the same huge torque ratings that some of the other drills do, it is a much more user friendly and high quality piece of equipment. The rare earth motor is extremely flexible for various types of work and performs perfectly. It is light, comfortable, and effective. I would recommend this drill to anyone who is interested in the very best tools."
0, Surprised...I thought it was a Ktchenaid: I've purchased a Kitchenaid blender and food processor this year and since then stocked my kitchen with KA utensils since i equate the Kitchenaid name with high quality. Unfortunately this item like so many other Chinese-made pieces where companies slap their name onto it doesnt stand up. I noticed it was staining where the silicon head met the plastic handle and then a few weeks later a tear developed and then it was gone. This item was 2 weeks old and didnt serve any more strenuous duty than mixing batter or stirring a sauce. I may try the French Made Le Creuset Spatulas next. Ive learned that regardless of the name check on the quality and where it is manufactured.
1," Macarthur helps the common man walk closer with God.: John MacArthur, one of our generation's exegetical masters, reaches into the depths of scripture and explains its jewels in simple english. Just as his sermons are a breath of fresh air on GRACE TO YOU, his study notes expose the full meaning of God's word; thus renewing your walk with the Lord. From the new born believer to serious students of theology, this tool comes highly recommended."
1," Brilliant book: Just get a copy.Many books on topics such as influence and hypnosis are either hype and no substance, or clinical and sterile. This is a great read, and full of information. One of the more interesting and influential books I've read in the past year."
1, Atlas Shrugged: Part One: I like this movie---it showed how differently family members view their company. One member wanted to leave things like they were and the other family member wanted to expand and try new products. Good over evil prevails.
0," Doesn't blend frozen fruit: Mainly want to blend packages of frozen fruit & yogurt for smoothies. Requires blending for a minute, then stirring up contents, blending again, etc. If I have to keep stirring it, why do I have a blender? Only seems to work right on the bottom where the blades are. Perhaps a larger motor than 500w would help. Going to have to buy a better one."
0," UNBELIEVABLE...: ...in the negative way, that is. This CD is amateur hour for sure. With the group's totally overrated sense of melody, instrumental chops, and weak out-of-key vocals, I am absolutely puzzled by the amount of critical acclaim heaped on these guys. I bought the CD and immediately took it back, and debated the merits of this pathetic group of musicians with the salesperson that recommended it to me. BTW, I'm complimenting Belle and Sebastian by even referring to them as a group of musicians."
1," I Feel So Great After Doing This!: I love this DVD because it helps to de-tox the liver and is a really great total workout. Since I've been doing the ravi and ana dvd's (I now have all of them), I've been paying a lot of attention to things I used to take for granted. One thing I've learned is that our livers have to filter toxins which we are always taking in from the environment as well as non-organic foods, etc. I love the idea that they made a DVD which focuses on the liver. Everyone, especially if you live in a city, should do this workout on a regular basis (and also think about going on a cleansing fast once in a while). Ravi & Ana's genius is that they can make dvd's which work on so many levels at once: detoxing, body sculpting, strengthening, and more!"
0," Loud loud LOUD!: I bought this fan for my dorm room before starting my first year of college, mainly because it was so cheap (a fifth of the price of a quality Vornado fan). However, this little fan made such noise (even on its lowest setting) that I regretted not spending more money for a better-made machine. I regularly had to sit down and attempt to clean out the layer of dust it accumulated on its blades - I've never seen dust like that on another fan.Bottom line, it's a cheap piece, don't bother unless you're already deaf."
1," So easy to clean with: This is a terrific product, makes cleaning FUN! and lasts a long time. I purchased the scrub brush over a year ago. i use it mostly for preparing dishes for the dishwasher, and cleaning counters and tables. Wouldn't want to be without it."
0," doesnt works with my iphone 4 and my ipod..: nothing, doesnt works, ive been conectc, and nothing, no detected my iphone and ipod x, x, x, =:::::( i lost my money!"
1," One More Chance: All songs on NADA COMO EL SOL are from the NOTHING LIKE THE SUN album but are sung in either Portuguese or Spanish. Producers: Jose Quintana, Bryan Loren, Sting. It's difficult to gauge whether NADA COMO EL SOL was a marketing ploy or a heartfelt attempt at crossover. In 1988, Sting re-recorded his vocals for five songs from his smash NOTHING LIKE THE SUN album in Spanish and Portuguese. In many ways, the decision makes aesthetic sense, as the original songs all have Latin-tinged arrangements, and Der Stingle himself seems quite at ease with the translations. Whether one really needs to own NADA COMO EL SOL, however--anymore than, say, Peter Gabriel's German version of ""Shock the Monkey""-is debatable, though the set will certainly appeal to completists and those fluent in Spanish and/or Portuguese."
0," awful!!!: ok, i admit it. i was sucked into this group by the really cool music from the volkswagen commercial, renaissance affair from ""blue wonder powder milk."" i loved it. i took a chance on ""a new stereophonic sound spectacular,"" and, while i didn't like it as much i wasn't hating it either. magnificent tree put an end to my ""affair"" with hooverphonic. no stars for this one. really, the writing was bad. the singing was terrible. and, the musical arrangements made lawrence welk seem, well, groovy. ugh! i caught a glimpse of their latest video/song and it made me all the more sure i made the right decision. i won't be listening to any more hooverphonic.i still listen wistfully to ""blue wonder"", but oh, the promise broken..."
1," Great baked donuts!: My family loves sweets and I love to bake so I decided to give these pans a try. I used banana bread mix and filled the pans using a plastic bag cut on the corner. They came out great! If you are expecting store-bought fried donut quality, then don't purchase these pans. But if you love donuts and prefer a healthier baked variety, these pans will come in handy......purchase 2 for making a quick dozen. Happy baking!"
1, Works exactly as described!: Used it last night to take a HUGE fat tick off of a friend's dog. Came off with no effort whatsoever.
1," If you like non-tourist travel lit, get it: The Mediterranean coast can be personally explored endlessly. Paul Theroux does it in a way that is authentic, or more precisely as authentic as one can be when one if free enough to tour around and around.Theroux wins high marks for this particular book because he gives concise, vivid analyses throughout. This is in my mind not the same writing genre as those that inform the tourist crowd about the better restaurants.Theroux's travel literature, as opposed to his novels, put him in the same class as Bill Bryson; William Least Heat-Moon; Jan Morris and Eric Newby. To me, Theroux seems like a man that could become cantankerous if not sufficiently challenged by being in challenging travel situations. He's at his best when things don't seem to be working for him, when he can't immediately get what he wants. And when he's at his best, he gives brilliant commentary on what he observes."
0, smell: This used copy literally smells awful - permeated with some kind of nauseating perfume. Otherwise it's a typical great Sayers collection.
0," Ugh: This product says ""Nintendo Wii HD Component Cable"" but do not let that trick you into thinking this is the actual NINTENDO brand cable. Silly me for believing that it would be such a low price..I guess you get what you pay for, because this thing is junk. I actually switched to my normal A/V cable after using this for two days. The whole entire Wii froze up and the TV started making a buzzing sound, and the sound persisted until I unplugged the audio outlet for these cables, causing me to suspect the cable itself is the culprit, especially considering it had never done anything similar before! This is quite concerning, considering we have a forty inch flat screen TV, and of course the Wii, that I felt this cable might have the ability to damage.Terrible, do not buy."
1, Always: can find best pricing here. Have even had the ‘Company’ reps recommend buying from this site for BEST deals around with ‘no hoops’ to jump thru.
1," So far so good. Scrubber info lacking in my opinion: Super quiet and seems to do the job. Setup was easy but the information on the bio-scrubber is weak and doesnt really show how/why this part is needed. Says it's to cultivate beneficial bacteria but it's just a series of plastic bristles as far as I can tell...unless the bristle structure helps in this regard? Not sure, just a guess."
1," ""The Speed of Trust"" Is about the Power of Trust: An important book because Covey calls our attention to the often-faulty assumption that we fully understand ""the trust thing."" Covey looks at the full impact of trust--and its close companion, truth--in creating alignment within and around ourselves. I was impressed by the thought-provoking treatment he gives the business-relevance of the topic, shining a light on how 'trusted' leaders and organizations do things better, faster, and at lower costs. It's one of those books that shifts your perspective, and also gives you the tools. Highly recommended."
1, Excellent Holiday Tradition: I highly recommend adding this movie to your holiday collection. It is bound to become a new family holiday classic.
1," Celebrate our Differences: Anne Tyler takes a new look at our shrinking world, with babies arriving from around the world, Grandmothers from other cultures, and everyone striving to be happy, healthy and to fit in.The engrossing story will make you laugh, grimace and cheer on the cast of characters."
0," Not big enough for 3 guitars: This is ok for one guitar, but not three. With more than one guitar, the headstocks will rest against each other."
1," This is classic!: This is a great soundtrack to an even better movie! This is a classic live album by one of the greatest live bands of all time. This isnt as good as How The West Was Won which came out like twenty years later but its still good. This would have been a lot better if they included 'Since I've Been Loving You' cause when Jimmy plays that in the movie its just damn amazing! If they would have included that this would be a five star album, but other then that all the music is good and deserves great praise, and yes even the half-hour superb jam 'Dazed And Confuesed'"
0," Destructive: Why someone would read this and believe it over a book that tells of someone that loves you more than you can emagine is a mystery to me, but thats the best thing about Jehovah, he gives you a choice, use it well."
1, The best Adam Sandler movie I've seen!: My husband and I were chuckling through the entire movie. Adam Sandler was truly funny (rather than just acting stupid) in this movie. Great screen writing. Highly recommend. Too bad there were a few mild curse words or else I would have let my 6 year old watch.
0," An outsider observes her adopted neighborhood: Having been born and raised in Jamaica Plain, I found Kathleen Hirsch's book to be typical of an outsider looking in. Throughout the book, there is a sense that the author is trying to impose her own romantic social views on a neighborhood whose depth and complexity clearly eclipses her own narrow and recent experiences there. Certainly her own experiences in the community bring some merit to the work, yet the reader cannot help but sense a tone of urbane arrogance as she observes with museum-like scrutiny the social habits of long-term residents who, ironically, are continually forced out by professionals like her."
0," The worst ""Clancy"" book yet :-(: Clancy and his publisher need to find another ghost writer for this ""Power Plays"" series. It was dull dull dull reading. Also, there were enough enough technical ""bloopers"" to further supress any suspension of disbelief. For example, why would the U.S. Navy keep their encryption keys at a commercial facility, especially one that is overseas? How does a Japanese-American pass herself off as the sister of a Chinese woman?There was some amusement, I suppose, in reading about the antagonist, who is a Harvard-dropout billionaire chairman of a monopolistic computer software firm, get his in the end."
1," A Fun Game. I loved it: Plot: Luigi recieves an unexpected message. He's won a mansion! Naturally, he's very excited and calls his bro. Mario. Luigi tells Mario to meet him at his mansion to celebrate. Luigi tries to follow the map to the mansion but he becomes lost. Finally he finds the mansion. Mario is no where to find. He goes inside the mansion but doesn't find Mario. He is chased by a ghost but when it looks like his adventure is over, Professor E. Gadd tries to suck the ghost into his invention : The Poltergust 3000. He fails and the ghost gets away. they run back to his lab where he tells Luigi that Mario has been kiddnapped by the ghosts! What will happen to Mario? You have to play to find out.Review: I personally loved this game. I bought it for my son and I found myself playing the game more than he does! It's funny, sometimes challanging and full of fun. Buy this game!"

1, Too cute!!: My daughter asked for this highchair for Christmas. It is easy to assemble. My daughter likes it because it resembles a real high chair. Only smaller for her babies.
0," It didn't teach anything I didn't already know.: Fussell distinguished between bad and BAD. Bad is obvious trash, but BAD is obvious trash which people think good. The main problem with book is that we all know that USA Today, airports, Hollywood movies, televangelists, and politicians stink. So why read 200 pages about it? Especially if the 200 pages aren't funny enough to justify the time wasted.The minor problem with the book is that Fussell doesn't know enough about economics. So he favors some sort of socialism.You can read this book in under three hours, but why bother, and why waste your money? Read his _Class_ instead."
1," HDMI Cables: These are standard HDMI cables 6' in length, great for connecting DVD/BR Players to HD TV etc, the cables are good quality, the shipping was standard, and the price fantastic, I would buy this item again."
0," Doesn't last: This product does collect mold and rust as other reviews state. Also, the bubble bath dispenser is an unnecessary feature since it doesn't release a lot of soap at a time and for the time spent in refilling the dispenser, it would be just as easy to add the bubble bath directly to the bath. Not worth the money."
0," not quite ready for prime time: I purchased PLAN PLUS because the description sounded wonderful. The program was billed as the successor to Franklin Planner for Microsoft Outlook. Installing the program resulted in a loss of all my Outlook data. Also, there were numerous script errors and the software would not work. The Goals Section was dated December 1999. I used on-line live help several times. At one point, I received a phone call for assistance from Franklin Covey. We were able to locate the missing Outlook data files, but the wait for service typically exceeded fifteen minutes. A couple of times, I was told that help was not available. Outlook, Plan Plus, and Internet Explorer were re-installed and repaired without success. I hope the problem is addressed so I may receive an update for my computer."
0, The Fountain: Interesting at first ! Then gets too far fetched into a freeky fiction kid of flick . I give 2 stars due to its off the wall path of strangeness.
1," A beautiful and entertaining cultural exchange: As a small child I lived for three years in Japan. Before we moved overseas, my mother bought me this book, I suppose to encourage an interest in Japanese culture. Ever since, I have loved this book, with its beautiful illustrations and thoughtprovoking and entertaining stories. Now I've purchased a new edition for my little boy. If you're looking to broaden your child's horizons, this is a must for the bookshelf."
0," Skip this book unless you're a completist: It's a good series, but this book's definitely the weak link--the villain's cardboard, there's a Tarrant scene that contains one of the all-time goofiest over-the-top 'thank you my pale lover, for the ecstacy you bring in death' lines I've ever read, and there's a death of a major character that's jarringly random, unfair and poorly-done. Besides all that, it's disturbing to realize that, even more than in other books, it's VERY VERY BAD LUCK to be a female character in this book. The gender wonkiness of this author is pronounced enough to be a good subject for a master's thesis, but it's at its most pronounced here."
0," Way to go Phil... You blew it.: This book has very little quality content. There isn't much revealed here that isn't found in virtually every other poker book out there. If you have read any poker books at all, don't bother. In fact even if you haven't read any poker books, don't bother. There are far better books out there.I read the Holdem' section and was left with a feeling that I had been robbed.Look at Phil Gordon's books and pair them up with Doyle Brunson's Super System if you are serious. Phil Gordon provides a solid playing style while Doyle's books provide the details behind the decisions."
1," Great Camara-Terrible Viewfinder: I am generally happy with this S3, but as I have gotten older, and my eyes are dimenishing, I need a quality viewfinder. This one is electronic and suffers a clarity that I do not have in my other cameras- a digital rebel and old sureshot. At times I have taken pictures not knowing its focus, only to be pleasently pleased later on. The LCD is also not as good as I would wish. I think the IS is unbelivable, and its movie capabilities are amazing for its quality. I do not want to sound negative, but this has been my experience."
0, very used: Book had tons of crayon marks all over it on the inside. I will be very hesitant to buy another used book online...
1," Been waiting for this...: I have been waiting for Ryan to put out this type of album for a while. Consistent, well produced songs that bring to mind all of Ryan's styles. His voice never sounded better."
1," Bicycle Bridge: Ordered this set of games for Bicycle Bridge. Very surprised to receive set of 3 discs just filled with all sorts of games. Card games, Board Games and Casino Games. Great Graphics and very easy to use. Bicyle Bridge not as good as one we used previously for Windows 93-95 but it is still better than any other software for Bridge that we have found."
1," MurderINC Manifest: I believe Irv Gotti definitely held it down 4 Newyork with the sexy songstress Ashanti Douglas, Jarule is the king in making pop songs.MurderINC is the future in hiphop by signing the Legendary NAS and Biggie Smalls babymother Charlie Baltimore. MY Uncle IRV Gotti should be producer of the year 4 using the foolish song and remixing it.Black Child is still hungry 4 the rap title and even Vita impress me. I love Cadillac Tah flow is so gritty like New York City . ITS MURDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 4 life. wats poppin Supreme"
1," Great comedy: My two sisters and I have watched this movie several times, each time trying to figure out which one is which character in the movie. Great fun."
1," aWsOmE cD!!!: Great CD to listen to. Roxette sang Listen To Your Heart in the 80's-90's that was a good song, now its even better with an up beat dance to the song featuring Edmee. Other songs are very good too. A must buy CD if you're into dance type of music with vocals."
0," HATERS!! keep hating, maybe that'll get her to stop singing.: Please Cassie, LISTEN 2 THE HATERS!!Cassie cant even be classed as a mediocre singer, she has a limited vocal range, weak support and basically cant carry a tune to save her life.This album is not quality music, well maybe with a capable vocalist it may be better.It's hard to believe that someone would be dumb enough to give this woman a record deal.Her live performances are even worse than her cd, she can't lip sync, she can't sing, she cant dance......she really should be embarrassed.Overall, cassie's voice is under developed, her dancing is amateur and is an all-round pathetic performer.This album is not worth a cent and if someone gave it to me as a gift I'd cry.Instead of buying this rubbish, consider something that doesn't make your ears bleed.-Sarah C."
0," Way too expensive!: I do a lot of baking, I purchased this item thinking it was a good price but when I received it there were only about 25 sheets in the pack. What a ripoff! I ordered the exact same thing from King Arthur Flour Company on Amazon and got 100 sheets for $19.00."
1," A truly great read: Man, I love how Margaret Atwood writes. I imaging myself to be a writer, but I don't know that I've ever written a paragraph that could go in one of her books. Could you love someone enough to destroy the world because they betrayed you? An all too possible future of genetic alterations, failed antibiotics, and global destruction is the backdrop for just that question. Read it. You will be depressed, fascinated, and thinking about it for weeks. What more can you ask for?"
1, Works great: I bought one for my sister and liked it so much that I got one for myself. It is a lot quiter and a larger filter than my older honeywell.
1," Nice fit for our A530: Nice case, perfect fit for the A530. Only problem is that the little pouch on the front does not have elastic, so the spare batteries we keep in there often fall out."
0," It is just not funny!: It was a long time since I have watched British sitcom. I heard about this show and decided to give it a try. I couldn't finish it: I switch it off in the middle of the fourth episode. There are a few laughs there but to get to those laughs you have to sit through totally boring stuff. Plus the acting is so bad, so wooden... I give it two stars just for those very few laughs I mentioned"
0," NOT A FAN: Great price! but that about the only positives I can think of. problem is that the wire bends and makes it really difficult to pick up my dog's deuces. I have a Great Dane, he takes massive dumps, should be as hard as it is. I'm about to buy another and throw this one out."
0, Buy something else.... Not this piece of junk: My wife purchased one for our 2 year old... It worked great for the first 3 nights. We wanted one that had a rumble to it ( powerful fan ). However after night three it began to squeak. This squeak was so loud that it woke us all up and my wife and I are 40 feet away behind a closed door. We thought that wa just had a defective unit so we returned it to our local Walmart and got another one.Go figure the next one was the exact same way... I'll be contacting Holmes about this P.O.S.
0, Will leak under airplane pressurized environment: I am a frequent flyer and noticed this product leaks under airplane pressurized environment and in my gym bag.Otherwise great product but I believe Thermos is built better . I have tried different generic store brands and Contigo but none of them can compete with Thermos products. I would not waste my money on this mug. Buy Thermos you will not be disappointed or buy this mug at Costco it is much cheaper.
0," Did not receive. Got a notice from USPS that an empty wrapper was found, and a copy of shipping label. Notified Amazon, but no: Did not receive this item. On Friday, 5-16. I received a notice from the USPS that an empty wrapper was found in the mail, together with a piece of paper containing the product info. Notified Amazon, but no one replied."
1," Okay but not the best messages: Watch this in a double feature with ""What a Girl Wants"" and ask yourself which young woman will be happier in the long run. (Add ""Mona Lisa Smile for a triple-bill.)The message that true love can wait and does not need to be hurried is a good one, but the plot postpones the inevitable trade-off that the main character has to make between her own identity and becoming queen."
1, Just for you: The kid tried something for his mother and every time he did something for his mother he screwed up on it. The lesson is that you can&#65533;t always be perfect but you can always be the greatest kid in front of your mother. The age level is 1st grade. Yes it was a good book.
1," Glass beats plastic!: We've been replacing our plastic storage containers as they wear out, and we're happy to be replacing with glass. Glass lasts longer, doesn't stain, is microwavable and is easily recycled should it ever break. We bought the 10-piece set, and then added a larger rectangle, and additional sets of the small rounds and small rectangles. We use them for storing leftovers in the refrigerator, microwave (you can even microwave with the lid loosely fit if you're heating something that spatters) and in our lunch bags. The lids snap tight, but are reasonably easy to remove. The only negatives are that they're heavy, and you have to be careful with them when they're hot - in particular, don't set them on a cold or wet surface right out of the microwave. This is a great change from the plastic containers we've been using, and we expect they'll last for years!"
1, An all-time favorite!: I first encountered this book when one of my students brought it to school. It has since become one of my all-time favorite books! It has a beautiful message of self-love. This is the first book that I buy for every new child that comes into my life!
1," Surprisingly Good!!: My first reaction was this is going to suck: Sinead O'Connor has sunk to a new low! I was wrong big-time. I have heard all the songs and also some that were out-takes and the whole reggae thing works for O'Connor. Sly and Robbie add a new dimension to the music and O'Connor's voice is as smooth and more so than Bob Marley. Marley being the reggae reference for most Americans paints an almost iconoclastic image in most people's mind. How can you stand up to a legend. Well, pretty good. Marley no longer owns the genre. Along with Sly and Robbie O'Connor proves with this release that she can perform many genres and be successful.Most all the songs are good and there is no filler. My favorite is Curly locks. Also, if you can find a copy of Shadroc download it.[...]"
1," A Chicago Area Favorite - Excellent Windy City Original Rock: Having enjoyed / endured the company of a ""delicate flower of the south"" for several years helps me appreciate Mr. Blotto's ""Southern Woman"" as featured on this CD.But you don't have to have that memory to enjoy the crisp vocals and smooth guitar on each and every song on this great collection.This album is a good introduction to the original music of Mr. Blotto for those that have not enjoyed their music in the past.Warning: If you put this CD in your car stereo, it may not come out for some time."
1, Lid Stand: This was given as a gift. They say it is handy as well as sturdy. They are avid campers so it does get used.
1," Greatness: After all of these years this cd still gets weekly play. It stands the test of time. Of course, it's Tom Waits so that probably not a shock is it?"
0," NOT worth the money: if this thing cost like $10 i would still be dissapointed, but paying over $30 or $40 for it is just silly. try to buy it used, or wait til they improve it. you have to find somewhere to put it where nothing blocks its light path, which is hard in a small baby room like mine. it's good for doody if you have a textured ceiling, even slightly. and as someone else said, the ""amber"" is barely visible. I bought it a week ago, and have even tried just turning the lights off and playing with my 9-month-old with it -- so basically i just bought him a really expensive toy. wish i hadn't bought it online -- i'd return it."
1," Now one has resources outside of 12 Step, and they all work equally well...: I use to be in 12 Step until I read a few books and discovered that the recover rate of 12 Step is 5%. The recovery rate of quitting cold turkey or doing other recover methods is 5% as well. 12 Step did ok for me, but I hated having to declare myself in a victim role in meetings, and even when I was trying my hardest I was told I was not ok and should try harder. Those kind of things made me seek out other forms of recovery and support. This book gives me even stronger areas to look at or recomend to my friends who are seeing how I am doing great without 12 Step and are beginning to question things to do instead."
0, Portable printer: Almost useless. Could not get it to work with IR. No drivers for system. No tech support. It is almost worthless. It arrived used and was supposed to be new. Could not return. Hope to get it to work with something.
1, Get it!: Its a very good book. I recommend it to anyone who wanted to improve their writing skills (including those whom are English native speakers)it also came before the expected day.
1," D'Addario makes the best: Folks, I've tried them all from Dean Markley to Ernie Ball. All have their good and bad points. But after 22 years of guitar playing, D'Addario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money. Although I prefer the super light top, regular bottom version, I have always loved the feel, tone and durability of D'Addario strings."
0, Very dry: If you are looking for a Downton Abbey fix... this isn't it. It's choppy and doesn't flow organically. Watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to view.
1," Donate To Their Cause: If you are even looking here, or on the fence, quit wasting your time and buy this CD."
1," The best, but hard to find: I love this stuff! Really chocolatey and malty, much better than the bottled ""Whopper"" chocolate sauce/drink mix. For some reason, no retail stores around here seem to carry it (they only have the vanilla). What a relief to find it here - I no longer have to spend part of my vacations out East in grocery stores, stocking up so I can have it at home."
1," The Forgotten Door: I remember reading (and loving) this book when I was about 11. So I bought it for my 11-year old daughter and reread it myself. While I have some criticisms of the book now that I didn't as a child (more about things that could have made it even better rather than things that were wrong with it), I still loved the book and my daughter did too. It's a wonderful parable of love and tolerance and understanding, on the one hand, and of ignorance, intolerance and bigotry on the other. I still would have liked to know more about Jon's world and have developed his interactions with people and animals in our world too."
1," Loved it!!!: Bought 2 DVD's, one for keeping and one for sharing!! Its a message needs to be spread world wide for a better future, for us and future generations!!"
0," Cheap: The Lasko home page leads one to believe the product is domestically manufactured at ""one of our factories in Texas and Tennessee"".Well, it's made in China and very cheaply so.The stick-on labels were falling off as I took it out of the box, the plastic is thin and cheap and the window extenders don't.I emailed the company with my gripes and they did not reply.I sent it back."
1," Amazing Stuff - Even for a very white chick in the tropics: Spraying this stuff on was so light and easy I didn't believe I was really covered, but took my very pale skin for a June week in Key West and came back looking exactly as I left. Beach, boating, biking - we did it all. Can't recommend highly enough. And my very fancy dermatologist said to buy anything with Helioplex - guess it's not just a gimick."
0," Move on from this one: This is second one I have tried in a couple weeks. The first one didn't tone at all and gave nothing but static, so I figured I would just exchange it as sometimes you get a bad one, it happens , I get it. Well when the replacement one came it DID tone but I had to crank the volume all the way up to override the static so I could hear it. I sent this back too and just requested a refund. I'll keep looking at others. I was very surprised that Fluke put out such a crappy toner."
0," Glad I looked at it in the store before buying!: People get ""collectors sets"" for the extras and pretty packaging. Yes, the books are amazing, but the ""pretty box"" is junk with a cheep plastic latch. I saw this here months ago and was just miserable because I was too broke to buy it. It looked so cool in the picture that I almost went ahead and put it on my credit card. Boy am I glad I didn't! The other day I saw they had it at Borders so I had to go and see and...CARDBOARD?!Like other people I didn't expect it to be stained hardwood, but did it have to be this chintzy, flimsy cardboard? It has all the durability and quality of a Happy Meal box and the display pic has clearly been digitally altered. Bad form, Amazon and Rowling! I so won't be buying this piece of junk. Just buy the books."
0," Only for those who must have everything Muse: Boring and poorly, no, laughably, made documentary based on interviews with people associated with Muse at some point - there is almost no information here that you can't get by reading things on the web and the added value of the video is blurry shots of some anonymous band playing live while the narrator talks about Muse playing live and slow motion pans across recording boards while the narrator talks about Muse being in the recording studio. Really, really, bad and mostly useless."
0," What Tech Support?: Just read the review about the person who contacted tech support on Saturday? No way. 321 Studios has never responded to any of my inquiries, nor can I get ahold of their supposed tech support. Do yourself a favor. Find another product. You simply do not get the promised tech support. As for the usefulness of the product, I recommend that you carefully consider what is written in the reviews. Although I was skeptical of a company ""planting"" reviews, some of these reviews are just too glowing in their praises. My experience with 321 Studio products is that they promise quite a bit more than they actually deliver."
0, Not one size fits all: This product is far too small to be one size fits all. I usually wear a small or medium and it is tight on me under the arms. The strange thing is it is very loose in the shoulders right where it shouldbe tight. It falls out of place very easily. It isnt a functional design.
0," I don't want to say it's worst thing I've read: I don't want to say this is the worst thing I've read, but it comes pretty close. While the plot concept is certainly scintillating, the execution is absolutely awful. Locke obviously hasn't discovered what a thesaurus is and uses the same trite words and boring sentence construction to describe every single event. The 'erotic' scenes(which are practically on every other page) in the book seem straight out of a stereotypical bad porn flick from the Valley. I actually found myself offended by some of the scenarios and how they were arranged and that's not including the poor choice of language. After a while, I had to give up. There was no plot, just awkwardly written sex that read like it was produced by a man. It was that bad and I have better things to read."
0, What a joke!: I don't know what kind of feeble fingers these other reviewers have but using this particular hand exerciser (black) is not a challenge whatsoever. This item offers an incredibly weak level of resistance. I'm a woman and judging by the name and the color I thought I might hurt myself using this but it's almost like moving my un-trained fingers through thin air. I'm returning mine.
0, A cheap disposable sander: Bought this sander after I had burned through a $160 DeWalt sander. Needed something quick to get a job done and purchased this sander. I really like the design of this sander it is pretty versatile. At a fraction of the weight of my last DeWalt it was easier to maneuver and sits upside down nicely. I don't use belt sanders frequently and this sander did the job when I needed it. It lasted 15 or so hours and went through 10 high quality belts before biting the dust. My last two belt sanders were DeWalt sanders and only lasted a bit longer than this much cheaper Black & Decker sander. After the failure of the second DeWalt I picked up one of these cheap Black & Decker sanders because it used the same belts. With the limitations of the DeWalt and their short lifetimes I can easily buy 3 of these sanders and not feel too bad about tossing these after a few hours of use. A cheap disposable sander I'll buy it again.
0, Great Price That is all.: I purchased this product because of the price and the Bran name. I have already had to replace one side a second time since purchase. AMAZON was great in the warranty process they sent out the part and the shipping was made easy. I was doing an oil change yesterday and saw that the other side in no torn open. The Rubber boots are not holding up on this item and it is lots of work and time to replace them. There fore I rate it at a 2 star for the price only.
1," The bible for coding Asian languages: Lunde's book is essential to anyone in the software localization or internationalization business. It simply covers everything. Want to know how to do regular expressions in Japanese? Page 445. The actual definition of ""Mincho"" (as in the Mincho font)? Check the Glossary. Postscript clones that handle Chinese? page 391.The book is intended primarily for software engineers, but the subject matter is treated so comprehensively that it is an essential desk reference for translators, information developers, project managers, production managers, and marketing executives.Just get it, Ok?"
1," English Satire at it's Finest: So I have not bought this copy, but I have a few different copies of A Modest Proposal and it is amazing.Jonathan Swift is really the father of english satire in literature and, along with Gulliver's Travels, this is his magnum opus.The basic idea is a proposal for economic reform by the export and eating of babies. Now the idea is rather gruesome, but Swift is not meant to be taken literally. The idea was so show how ridiculous people were being, fighting over religion and economics, by showing an idea that, truly could have worked for the time and place if people were okay with child murder. This is nothing short of one of the most hilarious arguments into the problems with governments and economic reform that was ever written.I highly recommend this short piece for both humor, literature, and a look into the human social mind."
1, so she isn't perfect..........: Okay she is no Mariah Carey (although often compared to her. Jessica doesn't song write as well as her.) She has Britney Spears appeal (although not as good as her.) Not as smart as Mandy Moore (wow it's a pattern) and doesn't have good voice compared to Christina Aguilera. She is average at all of them making her not have something that makes her the best. She does have the best realtiy show out of all of them. She is good at the moment as she is playing her cards well. Good for you Jessica Simpson.
0," I give it two stars with my heart bleeding...: "" Misplaced Childhood "" is an amazing album. It's a concept album, full of great songs, one mended into the other. There is the master-piece ""Kayleigh"" among others. But, when someone says that Marillion is very much like Genesis, forget about it: Marillion is Genesis !!! The difference is that Marillion sounds more ""fresh"", due mainly to the evolution in the recording facilities and equipments. Well, that's it."
1," Perfect for My Uses: They're not *that* small, they're 5"" wide by 7"" long, which is pretty decent size.I use them for re-heating veggies and baking individual pieces of fish."
1, what a hammock!: I got this last spring and it was awesome being able to lay around on it during the summer in the shade. Just put it back up this past weekend and I can't wait to use it this summer.
1, Bobby The Bear: This delightful book is one of my 5 year old grandaughter's favorites...see the author's Harry the Hare book as well..The European illustrations are wonderful...Good learn to read book as well as one that will hold child's interest as the pictures are so charming...We like to look as both books side by side and see the similarities in the background illustrations of both books...Good bedtime story...cute but nice and short...
0," extremely difficult to get through/not practical: I've read the 10+ Buddhism and Meditation classics.I like clear, practical books. I hate unnecessary complication.The reader will have to be extraordinarily motivated to get through this book, which is written in a very academic style and has very little practical content."
0," My baby gnawed this to bits in 10 min!: These pieces are fine unless your baby bites his/her toys--umm, every baby I know!--which may be why they are recommended for 2 year olds, but I am having trouble imagining what 2 year old would play with this boring puzzle. My daughter (10 months) likes it a lot, but she bit the head off the turtle in 10 minutes and now wants to gnaw the rest of the coloring off the other pieces. Sure, it's entertaining, but I don't want the printed paper in her tummy!"
0, Which filter is this?: Could someone who bought this please post which filter/humidifier model this is for? I can't believe they don't include the info in the description. Thanks!
0," A bit dated...needs to be updated: I enjoyed the ""what not to wear"" parts of the book. Although I found it to be incredibly dated. In order to be elegant she has you changing your clothes 5 to 6 times a day. Different outfits for 9,1,3,6,7,8 and 10 p.m. And stocking with seams...hmmmm Do they still sell these? There is some good advice but this book truly needs an update plus if you are not a city dweller spending weekends in the country a lot of this book will not be for you."
0," what a piece of garbage: This is one of the most horrible things my husband brought home. It is a filthy machine to clean... stupid plastic comb for the brush... give me a break... broke the first time i used it. The lines in the carpet are deplorable. I have to go over it with my REAL VACUUM to make the rooms look respectable. I would not recommend this to anyone. I guess if you are too lazy to use a REAL VAC, then this might work, but, not in this household!!! Really ticked when I saw what hubby paid for this piece of trash. I only wish we had not opened the box & tested it."
1," Exactly what I needed: Forced to order this online as no store in the area carries this, and I love my Bissell vacuum. Everything was exactly as it should be, arrived ontime, packaged well, fits perfectly. Thanks!"
1," Don Shirley is Incomparable: How come Shirley is so admire overseas, and the USA has yet to enter him into any hall of fame of consequence? No matter what the style,the period he chooses from, he has an uncanny ability to enter itno the spirit of the actual piece - his gospel is soul-boosting soul, his love songs can be heart-breaking, he can rage in tremendous chords where one expects him to have hundreds of fingers, he can produce a single line pianissimo that almost defies credulity. I cannot believe, as a collector of Don Shirley records from the old days of vinyl to CDs, that I have somehow never managed to get this one. I am stoked! As a pianist myself, I am happy to remain in his shadow and under his tutelage."
1," I'm Impressed!: I purchased this kit after trying other whitening products, such as the crest white strips, which didn't work at all. This kit whitened my teeth SHADES in only two hours! I did experience some mild tooth sensitivity but nothing severe, like other people seem to whine about. It tastes SO much better than crest white strips and its the easiest method I have ever tried. Plus, its only 20 bucks and since I'm a college student, its nice that it works and is affordable!"
1, Great Holder: This is actually the second one I bought. It is easy to see and organize all of the necklaces I have bought over the years.
1," The Best Edda Translation Available: ""Hear me, all ye hallowed beings, both high and low of Heimdall's children...."" This beautiful and poetic translation of the Poetic Edda echoes the beauty of the original Old Icelandic. It would be better of course to read the Edda in the original, but if you don't speak Old Icelandic yet, this is the translation to use. It has the convenience of having numbered stanzas and doesn't simply omit stanzas, like some translations geared toward those wholly ignorant of the traditional lore of the Nordic people, and so is suitable for study. If you are unfamiliar with the Poetic Edda's contents: The poems, dealing with the Norse Gods, are to the people of the North what the stories of Moses, Abraham and Isaac are to the peoples of the Middle East. This book should be on the bookshelf of every educated English-speaking person, along with a set of Shakespeare and the King James Bible."
1," This book has a remedy for everything and it works!: I am amazed at the different remedies found in this book! Most all of them work well. I have tried out a few and recommended a few to friends. I will always keep this book near when an ailment arrises.This book was recommended to me by another Author that is also available up here on amazon with his Novel for sale called, ""The Masconi's"".The Authors name is R.H. Tuttle Jr. and he said to try this book for natural remedies because he recently purchased it and after reviewing it said that he would strongly recommend this book to any one.I gave this book a try and like he said the book is filled with home remedies for relief and different ways of getting rid of different ailments.I thank then author of this book and I also thank R.H. Tuttle Jr. for reccomending this book to me.All the best-Jimmy"
0," Presto 02910 salad shooter electric slicer/shredder: The machine seems to work but it was designed for the American 130 volt mains system with their flat pin design.I have already pointed out that a robust voltage reducer for the 230 U.K. would needed to avoid burn out.The postage and customs fee was pretty high.My feeling is that there must be a different British option (although everything seems to be imported from China anyway).If the company hopes to sell on the British market (or some European markets), it must provide a 13 amp plug and address the voltage difference as a top priority.David Morris"
0," cheap construction: The first one of these I bought just plain did not work. The telescoping handle did not retract and the corner came apart the first time I opened it. I returned it for a replacement and the new one is just as disappointing. The handle works, but as I was walking along rolling it behind me the first use, I paused for one moment and the pin in the corner of the new one fell out as well. So now the corner of my new one is separated and the pin is IMPOSSIBLE to get back in place even though it fell out efforlessly. The cover is great as long as it is on the crate top, but it keeps falling off the front of the crate where is can be stored when it is not on top of the crate."
1," As Good as a Novel Can Get: This is an excellent novel that flows endlessly, like a river into the sea. I was almost disappointed for it to end. In this age of radical terrorism, each of us live with the fear of being taken hostage. This is a well-written story of terrorists and hostages in a prolonged struggle for various issues within their lives. After the Stockholm Syndrome becomes a predominant factor, the boundaries of those who are good and those who are evil become blurred, as is often the case in reality. If you must read one novel this year, don't let this one pass you by."
0," Jesus H Christ: Wow what can I say about this album except its utter regurgitated rubbish. ""How to dismantle an atomic bomb?"" Jesus Christ can they flippin be a little more original with the album names. Like 50 bands between 2003-2004 release albums that had title names like..""The art of this..."", and ""The science of that"", and ""How to do more crap.."" I mean could u stop the melange of blandness already! Has anyone actually listened to or read the lyrics to Vertigo? Turns out its the most trite piece of crap lyrics I've ever read in my life. Eventhough that's pretty much the only song I've heard off this new album I get this terrible feeling that U2 has pretty much lost all their originality by now. Oh well, some things are too good to be true...U2 is was of em"
1," A fine general overview of Irish history: This book provides excellent overall coverage of Irish history from ancient times to the present. It provides a starting point for all further interest in specific Irish topics. As a future Irish historian, it is good to see a well-written general text on Irish history as most books on Irish subjects pertain to one period and/or issue. Definitely a highly recommended book for classroom purposes."
1," GREAT VACUUM: I purchased my vacuum at a bargain store for much less than the advertised price here. I had to buy it. The suction is stronger than i thought. It actually lifts my carpet up while vacuuming. I love that i can use it for carpets and bare floors. It left my new carpet looking like when i bought it on thanksgiving day and the filter was jammed with dirt! Good bye broom, hello eureka! Cord is a little short..i do half the room and then switch plugs or i just add an extension..its not even an issue! I recommend this!"
1, No smells / Convenient product: We like that this product uses regular trash bags while still containing a lot of diapers. It holds a lot of diapers so it doesn't need to be changed every day. Highly recommend this.
0," Waste of Cash: OSI really Drolled the ball on this way, they have NO CLUE what the players want or how do get it done, the Shards have been down for 2 days now, and no clue when they'll be back up, the Bugs and issues are Everywhere, and they are in ""closed ranks"" people are quitting left and right and they refuse to answer the simplest Questions... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME."
0," Get what you pay for: I paid a totaly of $13.50 for these (including shipping). Without shipping they were about $7. that would be $3.50 a gun. Cheap right? They work just fine, and come with BBs. Perfect for someone just starting out. If you already own a gun get something alittle more exensive."
0," Warning! These are not the original versions: Warning, warning Will Robinson! These are not the original recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar that were released on Decca records in 1970. All are, what I would call, cheesy remakes. As others have said, the production and quality is lacking on this version. The lyrics might be the same, but the original powerful music production, arrangements and singing are sadly lacking."
0," wildly inconsistent: i couldn't even make it through the whole cd. the singles were supa-hot, but the rest of the CD is a disappointment. it's unfortunate. eve has a lot of talent and potential, but this album mixes too many styles and doesn't do it well. the result is an incredibly inconsistent, amazingly disappointing follow-up album. please let #3 be better."
0," Not what I was expecting: I was looking for a book that explained American politics in an informative, straight-forward manner. The Basics of American Politics spends more time trying to impose its liberal viewpoint on the reader than explaining the political system. Read the excerpt on Hurricane Katrina for an example."
1," Good, not great straps: I bought these for occasional use in the bed of my pickup. I would say I use them monthly. I like the length of these straps, definitely a plus. The ratcheting mechanism on one has become bent to the point of being unusable, however the other three are in good shape. Perhaps I bent it during use. Otherwise, these are a good way to secure your load."
1," It's cool CD if it's the ENHANCED VERSION!: It's a cool CD because it has videos for""Holler"" and ""Let Love Lead The Way."" Some lryics are stupid but the video make it up for the songs!"
1, Easy Read: Enjoyed this book - easy to read and keeps you wanting to know more about the characters. Worth your time.
1," Nice.: The Nazty North compilation gives us a taste of P Family Records' solid roster of Minnesota and Chicago underground artists, to overall good results.The album succeeds nicely in showcasing many different styles - toungue-twisting, club / bounce, hardcore, and meaningful. All of which maintain that North Coast sound that Midwest rap is known for.The album's production, handled mostly by the artists themselves, is surprisingly strong.The album's highlight comes when Rif Raf and Don Deedy hook up on ""Trip 2 Da Go,"" a masterfully constructed smooth twisting track.Although the album has a few weak spots, this is still a nicely done compilation which accomplishes it's purpose: to showcase P Family Records' unknown talent."
0," Terrible Recording - DO NOT PURCHASE: This is very poor quality recording, not even worth the cheap price. This was my first Lutoslawski piece and I was dissapointed"
0, Astounding Disappointment: Incredible that Marino and Lucy would cover up for FIVE YEARS or so that Benton Wesley was alive. And the reason for this? benton is a coward.I loved all of her other books. Glad this wasn't her first.
0," I had all the symptons...had to return: I mistakenly ordered Progon. My doc said to go head and use it...I had to stop taking it. Had chest pains, anxiety, shortness of breath, constipation, and severe hot flashes. It was just not for me."
0," Beware of loud static in your recordings from cellular interference!: I bought this product thinking it would answer my needs for recording interviews conducted by cell phone.However, after plugging the device into my Olympus digital voice recorder and doing a test run, I realized a major flaw. The recording was full of cell phone interference and was basically not listenable. It was the same sort of buzzing/static you often hear if your cell phone is in use near computer speakers.It appears that this device offers no shielding from this electromagnetic interference. Considering that it was made to be used with cell phones, this is an enormous design flaw. From what I understand, this interference is present on all GSM phones and it definitely is present on my AT&T; Blackberry.A major letdown and I will be returning the product as a result. Hopefully I can find another recording option for use with cell phones."
0, caught by mistake?: Used it for about 3 weeks. Tried all different spots. It caught 3 fleas. I feel like maybe the cat just walked over it and one fell off haha. Either way I don't think 3 fleas is very effective or worth the money. Disappointing. But fast shipping!
0," No Substance: The ideas in this book seem as though they were pulled out of the air and not based on solid design principles. Yet the author tries over and over to convince us that her ""scientific"" theory works. Nothing here supports her claim. One furniture arrangement is supposed to solve all decorating woes, but in fact seems uncomfortable and rigid. Ironically, this decorating is not good."
1," Four stars because of it's predictablity: DrumLineThis is not a movie I would normally choose to watch... And I'm not really a fan of marching bands and all that... But this movie was recommended to me by a co-worker, so I gave it a shot. It was very formulaic, but it was still good. Maybe it was because I knew nothing about how competitive marching bands could be, but I was actually interested throughout the whole movie. You really begin to care about the characters as they develop, and of course we are left with a happy ending.When you take a chance on a movie of a new genre, you can end up feeling as if you've wasted 2 hours of your life. This was not the case for me. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who feels like watching a ""feel good"" movie every now and again."
1," Better than the ""R&B"" of today. Kelly makes a solid singer/songwriter.: There is definitely some material here worth checking out:You Should've Told Me, At Least (The Little Things), She Wants You, National Anthem (Interlude) (My favorite, should've been a full song!), The Lullaby, All I Want Is You, As We Lay and Love Sets You Free.Yes, that's almost the entire CD, but this CD isn't without its faults.Good Love is very generic and almost unmentionable. 3 Strikes is catchy, but nothing to brag about and Like You Do Feat. Meth brings variety, but I wouldn't shed a tear, had it have been left off the album entirely. And as much as I Know Who Holds Tomorrow features nice and powerful vocals, I disagree with the editor's review, and say it is definitely overshadowed by other songs.Overall, a good release, but some songs weren't necessary.Cover Art: A-Inside Art: B+Songwriting: BVocals: AProduction: B+Overall: B+4.4 stars.If you're an R&B; fan, you should like this."
0," Love Jodi Picoult, but not this book!!: I began reading this and called a few friends to recommend it. It started out great. Picoult did a great job of introducing us to the characters. I couldn't put the book down for the first half. Once I got close to the end I couldn't believe how twisted and boring it got. I'm still not really sure what happened!! It was almost as if Picoult had to rush to get the book to the publisher so she just threw something together. I've never been disappointed with her until this book came along. Usually after I read her books it takes me a week or two before I stop thinking about the book that I just read. This book was very forgettable. I've heard great things about Nineteen Minutes but this book was so bad that I'm not sure I want to waste anytime trying it out.Jodi Picoult is a great author, but I highly recommend skipping this book!"
0," Thumbs down on quality...: While the digital photo album is a great idea this one lacks the resolution to display quality photos. If quality is a must for you then I wouldn't even consider this product. The resolution is only 320x240 dpi, regardless of the 640x480 dpi printed on the box, even for the Photo Album Plus (Kensington will tell you it is a misprint). There are wavy lines rolling across the pictures and one side of the screen is lighter than the other. Maybe this is why they are not selling these anymore... At least they are willing to give a full refund although you have to pay shipping costs so you still lose out."
1," Staple songs: This album is basically SW signature album even though they have had better albums this is one that helps you get into the band. All the favorites are here like ""HEY suburbia"",""i hate led zepplin"", ""supermarket fantasy"", ""dingbat"". The only bad thing that is sort of a common problem with SW is that they put too many average songs/ lesser songs on their albums so you get a lot of songs but they couldve taken five or so off and the album wouldve been perfect."
0, THERE'S A FRINDLE IN THE CLASS PICTURE: I thought the book was a little bit humorous and babyish. THE book was also alittle bit to easy for a forth grader. I also thought it focoused to much on the whole class. I didn't like Nick or the whole class.
0," Falls apart after washing.: After washing this by hand (per the instructions) the inner lining of the mask is peeling off. The material underneath the lining is irritating to my skin, so after it finishes coming off, the sleep mask will be useless. It also lets light in around the nose."
1," LORD PETER IS BACK: After decades of having to re-read the Lord Peter canon, it was a real treat to come upon this new tiltle, a continuation of the Peter Wimsey saga. This book takes place following Busman's Honeymoon. It is GREAT! I highly recommend it not only to fans of Dorothy Sayers, but to all mystery fans. I hope Ms. Walsh will continue the series."
1," Review #1: being the firstperson to review this fine video, i am inclined to say that it represents this fine championship of this fine american game quite well. As we hungarians say. Go basketball! Buy DVD!"
0," Reviews On Bad Music Impeed My Chance To Find New Bands: I am new-comer to Amazon, but not good music.I thought it was a great idea that other peoples reviews and recommendations(to include amazon.com's) may lead me to newexciting music similiar to my taste. Tt is a big world, right?Well I was lead to this piece of garbage for an album!I really cant express in words how horrible this album isso i'll just say i broke the cd in half with my bare hands!it gave me more gratitude to break the cd than to re-sell it!I guess I can lead out this review by saying. If you psuedo-intlectual wanna-be's that cannot immediately find somethingentertaining about a cd don't analyze it untill you can comeup with enough material to justifiy giving them 5 stars."
1," Very Good Blade: Very sharp (as it should be brand new), cuts very well so far. I will update this later if I have any problems"
1, Still as good: I heard this album almost 30 years ago on the 12 inch black vinyl medium and loved it then .I was reminded of my love for JW when i saw a track on Crossroads Festival(Eric CLapton).Hearing it again has revived the same feelings of facination with the stunning slide that has always facinated me.GLad to be back with Johnny Winter.
0," Smear and exploitation of Ayn Rand (read The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics for the whole story): This book is a smear job against Ayn Rand so that Barbara Branden can clean up her own tarnished reputation while cashing in on Ayn Rand's fame.James S. Valliant, in his book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against the Brandens, thoroughly dissects the claims made by the Brandens against Ayn Rand. He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Barbara and Nathaniel Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims. Even after Ayn Rand's death, the Brandens continue to cash in on Ayn Rand's self-made fame and her original philosophy of Objectivism."
0," This is not Keifer Sutherland's ""Beat"": This movie is not Keifer Sutherland's movie with the same name called ""Beat"". This movie is a Korean movie that was subtitled and I couldn't even get through because I was so dissappointed by getting the wrong movie. It needs to be made clear to the public what they are getting...this movie does not list the cast list. Keifer Sutherland has three movies that are in the can, but are not yet released. Beat is one of these movies about an author who has a homosexual escapade in the sixties? And then accidentally shoots his wife in a William Tell stunt at a party. This is pretty lame as far as a review goes, but had I gotten the right movie, I would have written the right review."
0," Hardcore Fans Only: This album is for hardcore Riders in the Sky fans only. It has a few well-sung songs framed with boring humor, self-mockery, and pointless patter. The phrase ""the cowboy way"" never fails to elicit a laugh from their in-studio audience. If YOU think the phrase is hilarious, you should buy this. Otherwise, skip it."
0, Stopped working: This is my second Aroma oven. It appears that these are no longer manufactured. My first one lasted 4 years of daily use. The second one started making fan noises last week (today is 12/26/2012) and today the fan stopped working .... the second unit is only 1 year old. I loved this unit when it was working .... I use it at least twice a day. I liked the fact that it does not use halogen bulbs which seem to explode in some units. At this point I don't know what I am going to do since even the Breville convection oven has it's problems. Don't they make anything to last these days?
1," Worth the investment.: An easy to use source for projects with many having multiple applications. The instructions are short, though better written and depicted than most I've used."
0," Yawn: Either it was the broken heater in my apartment that always kept it around a cool 98 degrees or the long, detailed, and pointless descriptions in this book that made me fall asleep after two pages of reading. You decide."
1, great music!: As with all the gaither series the music is great with a never tiring or ending message! We enjoy this easy listening album!
0," Something new?: Jeremy Camp is back with a new album, but it lacks the fresh depth of his last few, both lyrically and musically. We've heard this before on both sides. I recommend just downloading the ""Give Me Jesus"" song, a remake of a beautiful classic!"
1," Excellent study of military technology: Although the story of the role of technology in the defeat of german U-boats in the Battle of the Atalantic has often been told, the role of HF-DF (huff-duff) has usually been slighted. This book corrects that situation. Secret Weapon is an important new contribution in out understanding of the battle of the Atlantic, and an archetype of contemporary history of military technology. (From a longer review that appeared in the New York Military Affairs Symposium Newsletter)."
1, Truly Everlasting will be everlasting!: I've watched this movie several times and loved it each time. I love the fact that it held true to the book with a little extra storyline added. If you loved the book you will love the movies even more.
0, You get what you pay for: I can see why these CD's are so [inexpensive]. They won't burn anything faster than 12x on my computer. Don't be fooled. You are basically buying slower CD's so of course they are going to be [inexpensive].
0," Where's the book?: I was so excited to order this book for my daughter. I have YET to receive it. I was emailed by Amazon that I was quoted the wrong price for this book. However, this vender did not give me an alternative and I am still waiting for the refund.:{"
1, Another brave heart...: This is one of the most well written books on Scottish history that I have had the pleasure to come across. Its thoroughly gripping whereas other books about this time period have positvely made my eyes glaze over.It takes a deeper look at the politics and war of the time and introduces you to Bruce's fascinating followers James Douglas and Thomas Randolph. This book is a must for those interested in history.
0," They Changed It!: I was very disappointed in this DVD. I ordered it expecting to be exactly like the VHS I had when I was a kid. Instead of it opening with Mickey Mouse and Jimney Cricket, it opened with a camera going through a model train set and a unidentified man with a not-quite British accent delivering a long and rather badly written poem about Christmas. He talked between every single song. Also, there were all of these new songs which weren't the same quality as the old ones. Finally, I made it to the Wooden Soldier Brigade song, and they had CHANGED the soundtrack. They ruined a good thing. Why, Disney? Why?"
1, The perfect read!: This book was just as exciting reading it the fifth time as it was the very first. Every character brings you into the story and keeps you involved page after pag
1, Awesome Concert: Good Sound & Video. While these are all new musicans to APP (except Alan) the songs are true to original versions
1, nostalgic listening: I loved this cd when I was in high school. I had sold the cd forever ago and bought it again for a low price. funky modern rock.
1," Great movie.Moving and chilling at the same time.: This film consists of great acting and a great story line. I felt that the lead role was a takeoff on Dr. Jos, Mengele of the nazi camps. It is a shame that the movie is beyond the means of many people and I would implore the people in charge to lower the cost."
1," Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.: Having read the three predecessors, I was well aware of Barron's talent. I was hooked on 'Mirror' in seconds. Sadly...I finished the book in about six hours. Anyone who doesn't know whether or not to get this, you must. You really, truly must read this book."
0," Didn't read past page 725: I picked up this book since it was discounted and by William Goldman (Princess Bride being a favorite book and movie), so it was on a whim... I thought it looked interesting with lots of dialogue between characters - which is a style that I usually like. Until I started reading it and realized that this book was ONLY dialogue and that was used as much as a crutch than to tell a real story. All the characters are grating and annoying and the dialogue is contrived. So when I finally got to page 725 of page 751 I just stopped the insanity and decided to quit then and there since the extra 20 minutes seemed better spent elsewhere than reading about these characters. There is better out there."
1," Unique and intriguing: This is the last best role for Malcom McDowell, who is the perfect foil for Nastassja Kinkski in this artfully crafted film. You will never find the title song by David Bowie anywhere else either. Sit back and enjoy, and share my regret that none of the artists in this film ever got enough credit for the work they did."
1," Adorable Toy: This is an extremely cute toy. The little pigs, all color coordinated with their respective houses and numbers on their chests from smallest to biggest, are adorable. The pigs squeak when squeezed, the only thing that my son seems to like about this toy. Now, I refuse to hold that against this set. Possibly my son is too young for this toy, having received it for his first Christmas? Maybe he just simply doesn't like it? However, I can see where it could be a very engaging little toy. Though I haven't tried washing the houses yet, I love the fact that they can go in the washing machine. Having 5 dogs and all the dog hair that goes along with them, having a toy that can be thrown in the washing machine is a dream. My complaint with the toy? One of the little pigs came with the paint chipped off a part of his belly which is only getting worse with time, even though my son really doesn't play with them. Aside from that, the set seems quite durable."
1," Great Looking: The poster is exactly as in the picture with vibrant colours and all. It was packed safely and uncreased on arrival and looks great. I must say that having no white border on an art print really improves the appearance. The one thing I would advise is that it's printed on very thin poster paper. While this is not a problem for me, especially at this price, it is something you should consider if you're putting the poster anywhere it could be easily damaged."
1," for pre 1993 refrigerators only--but GREAT: If you have an older refrigerator, this is a great item for you.It makes your refrigerator run colder on less energy...thereby reducing your power bills and your carbon footprint.Very worthwhile."
0," Vicious and Cruel: No one could stop Jane or anyone else from accusing the Ramseys, for telling negative stories - - not even if they believed they were vicious LIES. But time has helped bring out the truth.The investigation never found evidence of the ramseys neglecting or abusing any of their children and the latest news we have had was that of an arrest of an INTRUDER suspect.He was cleared when his DNA didn't match that the killer left behind. The unsourced DNA that didn't come from Karr or JonBenet's parents.I have written a play - ""Murdering JonBenet"". It is available on Ebay. If people want to know the truth, they might want to see what I have to say. It does not name the killer, but it tells a lot of truth Jane chose to ignore."
1," Worked nice: Bought this for a project I was working on, worked exactly as described. Nice transducer at a nice price. Would buy again if needed"
0," good graphics, horrible gameplay: First of all, dont let the graphics make you buy this. The graphics are great but the controls are very bad and your ship often blocks your view.This game is plain boring. Please do not buy this, you will be wasting your money."
1," Very Helpful Book: I found the book Windows Vista All-in-One Desk Reference quite helpful in learning the new features of Vista. I wish I could say the same for Vista. It is a memory hungry, slow dog of a system. It was definitely released before it was ready. If I knew what I know now about drivers, slowness, and lack of a great deal of backward compatibility in the 32-bit version, I would have stayed with Windows XP Pro. Anyway, the book is a great help for me to use when I encounter some the silly built in features of Vista. Buy the book, if you plan to use Vista. It will help keep you sane."
0," You don't have to be dumb to hate this one.: I guess if you think you're smart and an extreme film buff, then you could go with the flow of critics and give this one 5 stars, but if you're looking for anything even remotely entertaining as ""Being John Malchovich"", then you will be sorely sorry you decided on this piece of fluff.The story moves at a snails pace, the acting is sub-par(Don't even know why Chris Cooper got an Oscar) and the only chemistry going for it, is Nicolas Cage playing off of...Nicolas Cage.It's not as smart or intellectually stimulating as ""Malchovich"", and I know it's not the same movie, but when you have the same director and writer, you do expect something close to being as original and funny as ""Being John"".Skip it, you won't miss anything in this over-hyped and uninteresting film."
1, good product: This thing is so easy to use. My wife laughed at me when I bought it. Guess who uses it the most now?
1," Lost and Found: This book helped guide me through a difficult time. It reads easy and follows like a recipe book. I would recommend it to any friend who has experience the loss of a spouse. The Author takes a very difficult subject and makes it understandable. Furthermore, I was able to get back to the business of taking care of business."
0," this is not a good video: this video has nothing new. it is all old.if you like *nsync's old songs get it if you don't get the new cd ""no strings attached"" march 21. too much to pay for a cheap 80 minute video."
1," hypnotic!: Brilliant! I'd have to agree with the Producer, Nick Gold who wrote about his experience recording these artists: ""A song would end and you'd realize you'd been holding your breath, hypnotized"".This is exactly the reaction I felt. This music puts you under a spell.There is very little vocalization. There is the guitar, the Kora and on occasion, an additional instrument or two. It is an amazing accomplishment that this CD was made with no second takes. Nothing was edited. These men instinctively held the music in their hearts and just let it flow out to us.A must have!"
0," I'm dancing with ghosts, you too?: Sappy with out the emotional conection to the characters, weak plot with loose ends, B-rated shock scenes and bad characters. The only good is Linda Hunt as a creepy nun in search of children with after life experiences is your idea entertainment. ..."
1," Blood Brothers: I saw a version of Blood Brothers performed a few years ago and have been hooked ever since. My cousin had this version and I knew I just had to haveit. Shawn and David Cassidy are phenominal, as is Petula Clark. Best recording of the show for sure. Dont listen to the others. this album is spectacular."
0," Watch Out for Expiration Date!!: I recently purchased this item since these are the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I usually eat one for lunch every couple of weeks. Unfortunately, these noodle bowls arrived with an expiration date of January 2009. So now I have to eat 24 noodle bowls in the next 4 months, which averages out to 6 a month. Don't get me wrong, these are great noodles. I just don't want to have to eat them so quickly. If I had known that these were going to expire in 4 months, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time..."
0," never try to buy this phone: I bought one... Charge it for one night, make two phone call, then pack and return it. echo and noise!!Cannot believe it's an IBM product!!Please never try it to waste your money and time."
1," Pretty Impressed: I was pretty impressed with this book. I am planning on reading all of the ""Ballad's Novels"" and I know this is the first, so as I read it, I cut the author a little slack (being this was her first). I did enjoy the story and the suspense. And I found the characters loveable. I'd give it a try if I were you!"
1," Definitely worth the money: I bought this CD off of a friend for 3 dollars. He hated it; poor kid thought that Helmet always sounded off-key. But there is some very creative, original thinking in this album. From the slow yet loaded riffs on ""It's easy to get bored"" to the fast-paced ""Harmless,"" this album brings something new every time I listen to it.It's quite unfortunate that Helmet broke up after this, but they made a lasting mark on the music scene. Forever will all metal/thrash/hardcore bands be indebted to them for what was truly an original sound."
0," ZZZZZZZZZZZ: Unless you are a big Lord Of The Rings fan, as well as big on fairy tale sci fi flicks you are going to fall asleep with this one. After an hour I had to shut it off, aside from the fact that I had no idea what was going on in fairy tale land, the 3 hour long movie just moves at a snail pace! This is a love it or hate it flick, there's really no room in between!"
1," Ahhh, I LOVE it!: I bought this on a whim and boy has it paid off!The dvd is a little nutsy (they actually expect you to pull off these maneuvers on the first time???) but it is a LOT of fun. I have titanium rods completely up and down my back and still find this product worthy of the money and easy to use. And the best part is, even 20 minutes a morning for two weeks and there is definately a difference! AND I had 2 kids back to back and my youngest is 11/2 years to boot.I highly recommend this to anyone who is just looking for something new or to improve their existing workout."
0," Worthless Junk: Before i even started to do my tax on Taxcut, i had to import my last year's return from Taxcut. I CANNOT DO IT! The Program keeps giving me an error message. It does not import Taxcut 2003 files! Warning: It fails to import Taxcut 2003 file! I looked around on their online help site, and apparently many users complained to them since last year, and they still havent fixed this problem with the latest update! So if you think you can switch to turbotax from taxcut this year, you are mistaken!For all I care, this program is worthless junk and you can forget about Turbotax from now on."
1," Solid Product - Easy to Use: I have several bluetooth headsets that I use with my cell phones, Skype on computers, etc. I picked this one up for $1.50 at a garage sale this weekend. It synched easily with my Blackberry and PC (Windows 7).+ lightweight+ simple, easy to use controls+ some people complain about size/fit on ear, but for me it fits very well and I easily forget I have it on+ volume and clarity seem good- the only thing I don't like about it is the way the ear support bracket flips away from the rest of the earpiece. The movement is quite tight and I read in another review that this piece can tend to break."
1," The product is excellent, Delivery is not.: Prell is overall an excellent shampoo. Delivery of liquids is a problem at least for UPS. I got a box of 10 plastic containers; two were empty and spilled in the packing and over the other containers. It took time to clean up mess.The company was so kind to replace the two empties without anything but a phone call."
1," The Ultimate Authority on Cake: Like other reviewers, I no longer use cake mixes because this cookbook's recipes are so superb. Perhaps it's not the best cookbook to give somebody with little baking experience, but if you *care* about your cake, this book is the last word.I have never had a recipe from this book fail. I've made two wedding cakes from it with no special skills or experience besides my iron determination. Beranbaum's idea of sweets, however, is sometimes more ""sophisticated"" than what people are used to. For example, I made the flourless chocolate cake for a family gathering. It was seriously awesome (my grandma and I gorged on it until we could eat no more) but it remained largely untouched by the rest of my family, whose idea of awesome cake is the sheet cake covered in crisco roses that you get at the grocery store."
1," Start of a great series for Sousa admirers: The President's Own play these like no other ensemble. I don't know what the current occupant of the White House thinks about them, but this wind ensemble is a national treasure in my book. This whole series is highly recommended. They play with more energy than the fine musicians of the Detroit Concert Band who sound a little bored on the complete Walking Frog set. They are a much finer ensemble, playing with greater precision and balance than Kieth Brion's British players on Naxos. The only weakness is in the documentation. There is none. We are not even told who the excellent conductor is. But that doesn't prevent one from enjoying the inspiring performances. Highly recommended!"
1," One of the best horror novels: This is one of the three or four best modern horror novels. The genre, ""genetic engineering gone bad"" is always lots of fun, and Koontz treats it as only a master can. The evil creature even has some wonderful, redeeming features, that are completely unexpected. The intelligent dog reminds one of his early novel ""Haunted Earth."" I envy those of you who have not yet read this!"
0," Leaking Kettle: Our first Krups kettle began leaking after a year's use & reckoning the leak was a fluke, bought a second Krups kettle. It too began leaking after 5 months."
1," THANKS TO THE AUTHOR: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, Nansook, for your courage and effort to write this revealing book! I hope it will open the eyes of those who have already been damaged enough by the Unification Church. Thank you, Madeleine, for your important contribution."
0," About 20 mins worth of funny stuff...: and the rest is just filler. I think Dane's halarious, but this CD honestly had me nodding off. A lot of the jokes were so drawn out and boring that by the end, you forget how it started, and therefore don't get the punchline (upon repeated listening, it wasn't that funny anyway). It's really a shame to have so much of Dane and so little of it be funny. Stick with ""Harmful"" and download some of his better stuff."
1," Great!: This book was good and I like the way Bonnie had Carole riding Starlight, or Petty Boy as he was called, to Pine Hollow because Veronica thought her horse, Garnet, was sick but Lisa, Stevie, Phil, and Phil's best friend, A.J. played a joke on her. This book was petty good. It's a book that you would love to read if you like romance, are horse-crazy, and would like to own a horse."
1," Good Insight-Well Written: Okay, so here is a book about a very real practical subject written by an academic. But it can work. Burnett doesn't have much credibility. He is a holier than thou, pretentious snot. But he has succeeded in capturing an enigma not many people have seen. He has captured the REAL issue of the criminal justice system during his stint as a juror in a murder trial.Flash by Burnett's snide remarks about his peers [remember they ARE peers] and his digs about how he even eats better than the others and listen to his discussion of law vs. justice. It is honest, in depth and well layed out. If you are involved in the criminal justice system in any way or are interested in some of the frustrations of those who are involved in it try reading this book. It is worthwhile. And even if you hate it, it's pretty short so the pain won't last long!"
0, Ripped off: I bought this dvd because I also purchased Unlocking Atheletic Power. The first half of the dvd was the same footage from Unlocking Atheletic Power. The last half was some ab workouts that were more pilates based than yoga. If I had paid full price for this disc I'd been really ticked off. It now currently sits with other dvds I no longer use. Get the unlocking atheletic power disc and skip this one...
0," Must be very strong to use: Not impressed with this tool. You must be very strong to use, especially if the lawn has overgrown for quite some time at the edge. You must go over many times before the blades finally cut through the sod at a steep angle. I found that my steel shovel worked better on tough areas. The tool only seems to work well if the lawn edge is already in decent shape to begin with. Recommend you try something else."
1, They do get hot. That's a good thing.: This has become the most used pot we have. My wife loves it.For those complaining about how hot the handles get that's one of the things that make this pot oven safe to 700If you only need oven safe to 350-375 get pots with plastic covered handles.
0," Good product - Poor Product Description: Well the quality of these rotors are top notch but too bad the product description is incomplete. In addition the product picture illustrates a set of front rotors but what was received was a set of rears. My recommendation is to state in the product title ""Rear rotors"" and change the associated picture to match the description.Well... now my car is apart, the replacement rotors won't be here for 3 days and you think Amazon would make it right and cover 2nd day delivery because of this issue?... thing again.. Great product but lack-luster customer support from Amazon."
1, FORTUNE'S FORMULA - A GREAT BET: This book is a great combination of betting and trading schemes and it is written extremely well. The history part is great as well and I have recommended it numerous times to universally great response from friends.
0," Not my best purchase ever: I bought one of these a couple of years ago and I haven't been able to get my knives properly sharp from using it, no matter how long I have spent carefully following the instructions. My partner couldn't believe it wouldn't work and, thinking I might be too easily put off, tried it too, using as many alternative artful variations in technique as he could think of. It didn't work for him either. I ended up throwing it out.Now I use a simple sharpening stone, which is far more effective and environmentally friendly. Better for your arm muscles too."
0," Not impressed: One dose = one bottle. 5x2 pills for two days. With the caveat on the label: repeat as needed. Which would be another bottle. 2 pills 5x a day is a little crazy even for a vitamin nut like me.Someone in my office was getting sick. So I took these bad boys, instead of vitamin C but kept my normal Orange Triad/ Alive alternating regimen, as well as Acidopholis and salmon and cod liver oils. I skipped my normal once weekly cold shower.Ive been sick for nearly 3 days. This is the worst cold I've had in years. I'm still sick. I'm all about homeopathic medicines and herbs, and maybe without these my cold would have been way worse. But if this cold keeps up for another couple days, I'm looking at 3 of these bottles. Today I took a behind the counter mucinex and im feeling much better. Maybe for someone who takes less serious multivitamins it would have a more noticable effect..."
1, Masterpiece: I personally believe it's way better than Gods Themselves and a must-read!I MEAN IT WAS LIKE OUAOU!!! Dont get discouraged at the beggining it might seem alittle boring but it gets better page after page.
1," THE BEST NINJUTSU/ASHIDA KIM BOOK EVER: I highly recommend ALL of Ashida's books, but this one is the BEST. Don't listen to the jealousy/brainwashed of Hayes/Hatsumi students, Ashida Kim is for real. I have taught several Marines in my platoon Ashida Kim techniques, and yes, THEY WORK."
1," Great Game!: My son just borrowed Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo from a friend. The game sends the player on an adventure through about 20 locations divided into three sections of the zoo. In each section, the player locates baby animals who require items found in other locations in the zoo to rescue them. While it may seem that so many locations would be difficult and time consuming for a young child to navigate, the layout is straightforward and each location has a distinctive look.My only complaint is that my 4.5 year old initally saved all of the animals with an hour. Unfortunately, the challenges do not change from game to game. You always find the same animal in the same location and use the same tools (found in the same locations) to rescue him/her. That said, my son still loves challenging himself to see how quickly he can get through it now and there are a few cute little hidden games within the game."
0," I'm in this!: Hey, I don't know if this book is good or not, but it's got a story by me in it, and even though I've read it lots, and wrote the damn thing, I still think it's pretty cool. It's about the end of the world. Wicked!"
0, Who needs this?: Who would want to listen to somebody playing Santana music when you can listen to The Man himself?
1, A great story: This is a great story if your into animals or not. It was great to see what could be done to save a dolphin. It is worth seeing more than once.
0," Wake up: I can't really review this product if I don't know what it is. Glad I didn't buy it yet thanks to other reviews. I am also looking for the Burstyn/Shepard movie.Amazon, have you not seen these complaints? How about a cast list please!"
0," Terrible Pan: 1 star was generous! Cooking an omelette in this terrible pan is a frustrating experience. The egg sticks to the bottom of the pan. I also bought a sauce pan with the same hard anodized surface. It is great for a sauce pan! I contacted Calphalon about returning the omelette pan and was told that they have no provisions for refunds. I sent a reply which was deleted by their customer service person before it was read. Fortunately Amazon.com provides great service and is processing a return. Based on bad experience from Calphalon Customer Service, I will never buy another product with their name on it."
0," Kimberly did not write this book: Just for the record, I am a student in an MBA program with Dr. Young and she did not write this book. The so-called content of this book is completely hypocritical of her true beliefs. The trash included in this book is not accurate of Dr. Young's teachings and counseling."
1," Excellent sharp, lightweight, durable knife: I purchased this knife a few years ago at big box store. It is easily on of my favorite knives. It is sturdy, has a wonderful feel in hand, and holds a sharp edge easily. This is the smallest knife I would consider for normal use. For larger handed folks, this knife will end just around the pinkie finger when held in the hand. So the feel may not be as ideal as with a slightly longer knife, but this knife is fairly stealthy when carried on the waistband. It is fairly thin as well which makes it nice for pocket carry too. I have many Kershaw knives, they are overall very nice and at a good price point."
0," ...AWFUL: Rates 0 stars (but Amazon can't give a rating less than 1).Patently offensive to blacks, whites, liberals and conservatives alike, foul-mouthed and without a single bit of socially-redeeming value."
0," poor tech support: This product worked great for about two months. I took great care of it.Then, it quit working. I wrote to tech-support and exchanged details. Then, I sent it to them. Two months later, they sent it back to me, without having done any work on it. And they told me that I did not have an RMA #.I am in the Army Reserve in Iraq, taking fire daily for the US. I don't need this kind of hassle. I made this clear to them in all my correspondance. But it got me nowhere.I think I provided more than enough info in the letters that I sent them and the e-mails. AAAARRGH!!!!"
0," Robert Bly's particularly histrionic take on modern poetry: The low-caliber high-octane unrestrained emotion-spewing in this volume will make you wish Harold Bloom or Louise Gluck had come back for another round instead.(Why are all the other reviews of this book referring to the utterly different 1998 collection? Despite what Amazon thinks, there's absolutely no shared material here.)"
1," Tight and well organized: This book is small, but you can't fault it for that. The coverage is thorough, the exposition is tight and the use of graphics is restricted to just what is necessary to support the text. I particularly liked visualizations like the one on page 70 where the computer keyboard is related to a piano keyboard in a clever and effective form. Nice going on this one. The Missing Manual books can be inconsistent but this one is great and definitely worth it for the price. A must buy for GarageBand users."
1," True Crime in Cereal City: Popular Battle Creek Michigan Morning TV Anchor Woman Diane Newton King is being stalked, and then is shot dead in her own driveway while her young children remain in the Jeep.

0," Poor design at a price: I should have been warned by the other reviews---but noooo. I bought this quasi-useless gimcrack. The first clue about bad design is the top; the ""handle"" is a slippery ridge impossible to grip. The amount of ground coffee for any given setting---make that ""coffee dust,"" for this thing is the antithesis of coarse grind---varies considerably. I bought this grinder and passed along my cheap blade grinder to my brother. But now I think I want to swap back!On the coarsest setting, the coffee dust is so fine you may wish to use two paper filters. No way it would be suitable for a French press or percolator."
1," This thing is huge!: I was not expecting it to be so large! Nevertheless, my boyfriend loved it even more cause it was his size lol!"
1," A very good brief review: This truly is a brief history of the last 2,000 years in the middle east. I kept wishing for more information but then would have been facing a gigantic book.So this is what is promised, something that gives you the basics of what happend over the last 2,000 years. And that is a very good book to read first so that as you read of various periods in more detail, you can hang that onto this understanding of the entire time.As to the writing itself, it is good to very good."
0," Its a Crock: For the people who lived this,and if you go by the other review and not what really happened,you can be sucked into the hype.Was there a history teacher loved by the town,yes.The woman who stirred up this crap,really beloved him,and when he did not belove her back,she decided to cook his goose.The school took the easy road and ruined his career.She is really behated in this town.the movie showed her getting some support towards the end?Never happened.She did however make a fast buck writeing a pack of lies,selling to liberal Hollywood,and sucking in a bunch of stupid libs who write from there shirtsleve instead of there researching little brains."

0," Complete waste of money: Do not waste your money on this latch. I bought one to replace the latch that had broken off my 1984 F-150 after nearly 30 years of use. Tried installing the new latch and one of the screws broke in half while running it down with my Porter Cable cordless drill with the torque set at 2. Had to drill a new hole up to 3/16 to get the old screw out, then after filling the bigger hole with JB Stick, re-drilling and installing another screw everything seemed fine. After reading other reviews about the latch breaking, I knew I had to be very careful. Even then, I started slowly pushing the latch down to lock it, and with very little force the plastic snapped. I'm not going to bother returning an item that only costs $5 as it is not worth the trouble, but wanted to write a review to let other people know that you are better off finding a latch in a junkyard."

0," Review on Des Hammil's Power Tune advices: At first the books starts falling apart when looked in for the first time. The glue does not hold the pages together. Second, the quality of the ""tips"" Mr. Hammill provides us with is below average. The information provide[d to] the potential buyer is unadequate, when compared with the contents of the book. Example: there is no real tune-up info regarding some essential items like tuning carburettors and exhaust pipes.Advice: a waist of money and time. A definite NO-GO!"
1," A Must Buy: If you are a parent with a child about to enter college, you would be a fool not to purchase this indispensible tool to financial literacy. Take it from me. I've already got three kids at universities across America. The one thing you want to avoid is a desperate call from your son or daughter seeking thousands of dollars to cover an outrageous credit card bill. ""Please Send Money"" is an easy-to-read book with many (often entertaining) stories illustrating every key point. You don't even realize you're learning!!!!"
0, Not that great: One of the earring backs came with a sticky label on it and it was so hard to get off that it bent the back out of shape. I put on the earrings and not 5 minutes later the back was gone. The backs are so small and fragile that they are not adequate to keep the earrings on. I found another back from a different pair of earrings so I could wear them both but I dont trust them to stay on. I have bought a lot of items from amazon in the past and have been very happy with everything else but would stay away from the jewelry from now on.
1," Very good: I agree with others - this is a very good book - exposes many of the inerrencies in the tithe-doctrine. It is a bit harsh, and the graphics are a bit much, but it is a worthwhile read. The most amazing part is the author confirmed what I have long believed: that tithing is not for the Christian church. Hopefully, as more books are written on this subject, the Church can move away from this flawed doctrine and back to the Bible."
0, Overrated!: I know I am in the minority...but the Beatles' success was a product of their era; overrated! They would never make it today! A couple good songs that are only good because they remind me of a good movie or commercial. Don't bother if you were curious like I was.

1," Lost Season 5 Best Yet!: I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will..."
1," Spectacular, Spectacular: Okay, I admit it. When the Absinthe fairy appeared, I was hooked. I mean, here I thought I was the only guy in the world who saw little green fairies while on a bender . . .The movie is a total hoot! Luhrmann keeps piling up bad 70s pop songs, relentless kitsch, bad 80s pop songs, dizzying camerawork, bad 90s pop songs, huge dance numbers, bad Rogers and Hammerstein songs and narcoleptic Argentinians, one upon the other, until he creates this massive, frenetic, rococo tower of crazed pop images that lists wildly back and forth in the wind, but somehow manages never to collapse upon itself. It's a gorgeous, sprawling, insane mess that completely impressed me with its audacity, energy and originality.And, of course, now I'm gonna think of Jim Broadbent every time I hear a Madonna song . . ."
0," stopped working after 4 months: This dvd player stopped reading discs about four months after I bought it. It will only read a disc about once every 30 tries now and has started eating dvds. Not only does the laser fail to read the discs now, but the belt is also broken and the dvd fell off the tray and was damaged. And the other annoying part is that the VCR still works fine, so it seems a waste to scrap it altogether. You're better off having a separate dvd player, and certainly not a ""daewoo"" one. It may seem like a bargain, but believe me, it's not."

Pictures and text page imageswere off center- cutting off parts of the intended information and leaving blank areas on the other side of the page. I choose not to have the extras programs, because they are trouble, but the printer install disk put them in against my wishes. Took me 2 hours of hunting those files and deleting them. Most of those files were for ""upgrades"", so the installation of those files were spam to try to get me buy more- virus is a better word. In the trash is where I but this printer and I hope nobody else has to go through what I did. Do not buy."
1," Moving: I found the book moving and compelling. Given that it is short and that I could not put it down, it was over far too quickly. I think it would be an excellent book to read and discuss with teenagers. One thing, unlike other reviewers, I am sure that the main character does not talk, not out of willfulness, but because she truly is unable to."
0," Malfunctioned after 1 month, dead in 2 1/2 months: With the great reviews, I was hopeful to finally find a decent portable radio. Shortly after receiving and using this product, it would shut off every time I engaged the lock mechanism. Yesterday, it just quit working. I can send it back with a $6 check but will not spend any more $. I have been through 5 radios over the last 8 months- they are all JUNK!"
1, One of the best: So far I can say that I am more than pleased with the Plantronics Voyager 510 Headset. It has out performed all of the other headsets that I have used in the past. For the price it can not be beat and I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good well constructed headset.
0," Buyer be ware: I am a big fantasy fan and I follow pretty much what is written and is on the market but this book is an insult to the name Everquest and R.A Salvatore. After the great written intro by R.A Salvatore I fell asleep 10 pages into the story. The story is hard to follow, battle scenes confusing and misses a continuous story flow. My advice go to a bookstore start reading the actually story (not R.A Salvatore's intro) and then decide for yourself. I for myself will keep it as a reminder that a great name as part of the coversheet does not mean a good story."
0, i wouldnt buy it.: War and peace was brilliant. Anna Karenina isn't. Her character may be complex but it's nothing extraordinary. This book is not a tragedy -- anyone as confused as anna should die asap. Her son's slow and forced forgetting of her is a lot more interesting than her but only occupies a page or two out of 600. There's only one passage here worth looking at for language's sake -- the description of what she sees when she kills herself.
0," 0 stars if I could...: ... I have rarely disliked a heroine as much as Louise, a much sought after beauty, who must go off to Europe and marry a disfigured, famously ugly Charles. I thought it was sort of creepy to fool Louise by always being in the dark. ... And, again, I found nothing likeable about Louise. Perhaps a romance with an 18 year old girl who really behaves more like a 14 year old was a bit immature for me. After all, I am 31 years old..."
0," Carlin's Swan Song: George Carlin has done it again. A concert intended for laughs but ends up going much deeper. He easily attacks our beliefs and values, destroying them. Same wonderful Carlin, funny but thought provoking. Obviously much more than a comedian. He knows all the stuff we have had jammed down our throats by parents and religion and appropriately educates us all with simple logic. Who else could make one not believe in God or government? Makes a lot of sense to those willing to think and question why we are in this state. George Carlin, before his death, implored people to ask why they should believe in something with no proof. He will make you re-evaluate all that you believe in. A must see for eveyone out there. There is something that relates to us all."
1," More WWII story made into good space opera: When we last left The Helmsman in Book #5, he was very busy defending Avalon against the League, AKA the battle for Britain. Now in book #6, our hero is busy defending Sodeskaya (the Bears) against the League. Very much out of WWII and updated to a very classic space opera."
1," ""murph"" at his best: i lost this album out of my collection around 15 years ago, and i sure am glad i was able to finally replace it! this is micheal murphy at his finest, before he ""sold out"" to formula-country B.S. the only other disc that i've been able to find by him that is of similar quality might be ""blue sky-night thunder"""
0," Not so good.: Boring, over-glammed and not at all engaging. Paul Bettany is great when he's not a dark action hero. In this and, particularly, Legion, he is disappointing. It might just be me, but graphic novels do not translate well to the screen. Maybe its because they almost always get crappy directors and poor actors. This movie is average for what it is, which means its not that good. Whoever made the trailer deserves the credit because they made it look good."
1," Kept me interested: Not being the biggest fan of Kristen Stewart, I was really drawn to this movie by Charlize Theron. I was very interested to see how the story would be relayed with so much underlying darkness. I thought it was pretty well done. The special effects were nightmarish and the story was consistent enough that I wasn't constantly rolling my eyes. Still not the biggest fan of Kristen Stewart. No issues with the quality of the movie, really easy to order and watch this way."
0, jason: its ok wished it was made a lil better not very durable fabric def not high quality costume in my opinion
1, Sistina Revitalizing Creme: This creme is a little pricey but well worth every penny. I am a 62 year old woman with sun damage to my face and forearms. Since using the creme the sun spots have almost disappeared. It is a great product.
0," Don't buy this - lousy picture quality, not worth the money: I actually won mine in a raffle, and replaced my 12 year old Panasonic 32"" tube TV with it. What a mistake. I was expecting a huge improvement in my DVD playback, since I could finally take advantage of the Progressive Scan output of my DVD player. I spent hours playing around with different settings, trying to get an image as sharp and clean as I used to get on my tube TV. But DLP projection technology isn't capable of it. The image is terrible. Lot of grain, noise and ghosting, and way too many motion artifacts. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, but I wish I'd simply donated it back to the charity I got it from. So my advice is, don't buy this. And if you're seriously considering it, go find one in a store somewhere and bring in some of your own DVDs to see for yourself."
0, Only OK: Lean body is ok. I purchased the chocolate and the consistency kind of makes me sick. The flavor is decent.
1," Funny, insightful look into a treatment that no longer exists: In this book, Betty McDonald writes about her experience with t.b. and being in a sanatorium for 9 months -- at the time the only way they had to cure a patient, and hardly a guaranteed one.Like The Egg and I, I started out really into this book, and by the time it was over I was as ready as Betty was for her to go home. However, the look into life in a sanatorium in the 1930s, when there was no known cure for tb and doctors barely even understood what it was, is certainly an interesting slice of life.Also: I read my uni library version of this book, which was personally inscribed by Betty herself, to ""Bernice, who has been through this in all its phases -- Love, Betty McDonald"" The two doctors who the book is dedicated to have also signed the book. And glued to the inside cover is Betty McDonald's obituary. So apparently the original owner of this book knew her. (This is why library books are so much cooler than store-bought ones)"
1," Great book, not too long, not too short, just right length and enjoyed ""Neverwhere"" very much.: Enjoyed the book very much, was not one which dragged it on and on, but it held my attention and up to my expectations."
1," 5 Star Music: There is quite a number of good tunes here.He also wrote songs for other artists and had success with songs like The Best That You Can Do from the movie Arthur.He rolled out the hit's,and my earliest memories of him were all these National adds.Next thing i knew he was just gone,sadly he died in 1992.You heard his music from time to time,so there is quite a few songs here i knew upon getting this album.I Still Call Australia Home probably is his crowning glory,i have heard that song by other people on adds over the years.I think this a nice review,but i better check with my editor."
1, An Enchanting Book: Dr. Weiss is actually more objective in this book. I esp. love the chapter about grievance.
1, Good Movie: No complaints about the movie itself but it took about an hour to download it. It got stuck at 9% and I had to actually shut my DVR down and restart it to get the movie to download completely.
1, Buena compra: Lo compre por nesecidad y ahora me ha servido para un monton de otras cosas sin ningun problema.
1," One of the greats: First off, I'd like to explain some things to the casual Madman reader. This is NOT the beginning of the series and, as such, will not include the origin or anything like that. But you do get some extremely interesting material. A collection of the second series (ironically entitled Madman Adventures), this is some of the best material available in comics today. Also includes an introduction by Mike Allred himself."
1," Pretty Excellent: It covers enough to start hacking the kernel pretty easily. Pretty wonderful.The only reason it's not 5 stars is b/c I bought the kindle edition, where all the tables (which hold important data!) are completely mangled. Other kindle books use scans of the tables, and other ebook systems spend engineering time on making tables display well."
0," nostalgia ain't what it used to be: Loved the Christmas TV special ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as a child, so I thought I'd order it. Having watched it for the first time in about 35 years, it no longer measures up (with the exception of the nativity scene) to such greats as Mr. Magoo's ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". Generally a big bore, although the Vienna Choir Boys still inspire."
0," Not described properly!!!! Be careful!!!: Well, I ordered these being a bit foolish since there was no description of their size or count. Traditionally, whatever is shown in the picture is what comes, but that is not the case with this item. These are QUAD CANE TIPS, not standard cane tips. They are 5/8"" in diameter and come four (4) to a package. Great deal for the price, but not what you are looking for if you care to use it for a traditional cane."
0," jay-z does it again: Lets all hail Jay-z because he has made another bad cd. Each time he makes a cd he sounds more and more like a stupid pop artist. Jay-z lays down more BS than any other artist out there today. I dont see how Jay-z can hate on anyone but himself for this cd. He is almost as bad as P.diddy. Anyone who buys this cd is wasting thier money, they should be doing something much better with their money like...buying any other cd in the whole entire world."
0," A mirical working dj!: Dont get me wrong, Dj Tiesto is the leading dj out there. With the most relaxing yet mind racing productions. But this is my least favorite cd he's put out. Possibly one or two tracks here that could exite you but if you want to catch a drift of what he's about I have some other suggestions for you. The entire trilogy of ISOS. It will take you through emotions you were un-aware of, and back."
1," A Message From Gila Monster, Jr. :: As someone who enjoys the absurd, I've found this book to be a hilarious and thought provoking (Seriously, who WOULD win in a battle between duck-billed platypi and man?) additon to my collection. Mr. Hodgman's writing, like that of Kurt Vonnegut, is non-sensical, yet strangely truthful (except that the entire book is made up of lies). And even though I am only 60 pages into the book, I can honestly say it's a page turner. By that, of course, I mean you actually have to turn the pages yourself, which, incidentally, is why I'm only on page 64. The paper in this book is just so heavy and thick.With writing this captivating, it's only a matter of time before the book is made into a movie. At which point, you'll see me outside your local theatre telling you that the book was so much better than the movie (except for the EPIC duckbilled platypi vs man battle scene - no collection of words could ever top a multimillion dollar CGI extravaganza of that sort.)"
1," An Attention Getter: I wondered what was next and if, what was next, could compare to the ""Book of Words"" trilogy. There wasn't any comparison. ""Cavern of Black Ice"" has surpassed all J.V. Jones' novels to date. The story moves and keeps one's attention. In fact, the descriptions are so alive I was forced to put a sweater on as the hero and heroine made there way through the story. If Ms. Jones keeps on the way she is going there may have to be a law passed on the limits of one's imagination. One hell of a read. Good job J.V. Jones."
0," WARNING !! BAD LED CONTROL UNIT DESIGN: I have replaced the control unit, aka led panel...all one part # CPWBFB075MRU0 three times. With the original unit that's one, Sharp repaired...that's two, one I bought that's three and now it needs a fourth. I don't think so, no more Sharp microwaves for me.If you want to replace the unit it is very east to do. Go to [...] and type in the model # it's about $[...].I would suggest a one month subscription to Consumer Reports to evaluate ovens before you purchase, it's only $[...] for one month subscription."
1," Becky at her Best: Although Becky Freeman has authored and co-authored many books, in my view, this is her best. Her creative descriptions of marriage styles, interactions, and coping strategies are authentic, and typical of stories I have heard in my counseling office (I am the ""therapist friend"" Becky refers to in the book). The stories she shares from her own marriage are representative of many couples' struggles. Becky's trademark humor prevails throughout, but not at the expense of being real. Whatever your marital flavor, this book is a winner -- don't miss it."
0," Not whining. I have simply done what every author wants.: Simply put, George Martin has been in the fits of terrible writers block for some time. I recognize it, because I live the nightmare. Why he felt the need to be dishonest and say that he split the books to keep their length down is anyone's guess. I am upset at his decision to do so for two reasons: 1)I feel a close connection with the characters and the desire to know their fate is very real for me and hasn't been sated for several years now, and 2)the author obviously fibbed when his readers would likely have accepted an honest but delayed attempt to attain the literary successes of his past. This series has been incredible until this entry. I'm sure that you know that, Mr. Martin. The interwoven strands were a part of the magic. Give us more of the tale soon and be straight with us in the future."
1, good version of Farenheit: Though It looks a little bit dated by now the movie succeeds quite well. Oscar Werner is excepitonal.
0," Every conspiracy but the kitchen sink a book does not make!: las Vegas has made a living for half a century on a fantasy-that the so-called Mafia financed and often operated the casions,Nothing could be fyrther from the truth, of course. From the day the first electronic slot machine was installed ,America's top banks and financial institutions never hesitated in investing in Las Vegas operations...The authors of this silly book throw in every well-publicized conspiracy from the last half century in a useless effort to show that Nevada is owned and run by bad characters .This is great for Nevada's image-that badfellas run the joints.Its too much for a knowing person . But for those who want to wallow in Mafia nonsense( there is no such thing, of course ) this pitiful book might pass a few hours .Why publishers distribute this sludge is a mystery."
0," Magnetic cord problems: Had problems with the magnetic cord staying in place, the first time I used it. The magnetic cordwould not keep constant contact thus the oil was not always up to the 350 degree setting.The french fries took for ever to fry and chicken too...not impressed with this fryer because of thecord not keeping in place. Otherwise, the fryer has many features that are great."
0," Totally uselesss: My company is going to get some customers in Asia. We are (2 ASP, VB 10-year experience programmers) going to make our products to be able to support Asian language. What we read this book and we found totally nothing help us. Even I would like simply message box a Chinese word instead of ??? in VB application. We also searched many websites and newsgroups that talk about it. Michael and People sometimes introduce this book in the newsgroup. But why people still keep asking such kind of questions, like ???."
1," Good Headphones: Good head phones for a decent price. They feel kinda loose on my head at times, but they have good sound"
0, Slow to learn: Needs simple illustrations not long descriptions.You can not quickly learnyou must go through long excercises instead of short descriptions with drawing.The problem is I have not seen anything different for Revit or Architectural Desktop.
0," Clean Freak: This product is great for the compact size, but as for cleaning it leaves alot to be desired. I purchased this to make it easier to clean the car interior and workshop benches and equipment. The attachments that came with this product is not anything needed to get in those tight areas. It is my own fault for not reading the product details, but this is the first time I have ever bought a wet/dry vacuum that didn't come with an attachment for those tight places."
0," One of the worst movies ever made: On Saturday Night Live, the ""It's Pat"" skits were always funny. The movie, however, was not. Yes, it is a very bad idea to take a few minute sketch and try to stretch the joke into a 90 minute movie. While it's is not a great movie it is pretty funny at times. Especially the neighbor who becomes so very psycho obsessive in trying to discover Pat's gender."
1," A must for parents and counselors: Where's Grandpa? touches the heart of anyone who has ever suffered the loss of a loved one or tried to explain loss to a child. The family remembers the wonderful times they have had with Grandpa but the child still wonders, ""But where, exactly is he now?"" The illustrations are wonderful and compliment the story. This book shows a sensitive way of dealing with bereavement."
0," This product cannot be returned!: I bought this product thinking that I could return it if I didn't like it. (Usually Amazon is great about this.)Wrong.Apparently, this is due to it being a liquid and so it's considered hazardous and not returnable. So, either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase."
0," Don't buy it: The packaging is so stylish and modern that I had high hopes for this CD ROM, but I was wrong. It's far too simple, the interface is ugly and the background music (which you can turn off at least) is annoying. And occasionally it even provides incorrect answers! My kids never use it and I'm sorry that I bought it.Where are the fun, intelligent educational software titles these days?"
1, I don't believe in unicorns: In my opinion Hitchens easily won this debate. I was surprised that Craig persisted in wanting Hitchens to provide arguments that God did not exist. If someone believes in unicorns it is not up to me to prove that they do not exist. In the final analysis Craig was only left with his faith in God. Does Craig really believe that tithing is an example of the objective morality based on belief in God???
0, Returned it: Reception was very bad. Could not get a clear signal. Music kept breaking up. I returned the product
0," Not quite there: Wow!It's not a stretch to connect Soddam Insane with state terrorism - like using gas to kill off unwanted citizens. It is a stretch to connect him to independent terrorist groups like Al Qaida or the Contras.A much more documented connection would be Ronald Reagan and terrorism. Yes Soddam was a monster and a jerk, and gassed Iranians and Kurds with....American gas, he got from Ronalds Reagan and Rumsfield. I guess that means that besides El Salvador, Honduras, Iran, and Nicaragua, Reagan must be connected to Al Qaida. If this book is correct.If you want to connect some interesting dots, check out standdown.net"
1, It works great on my laptop.: I have had NO problems with vista. I upgraded from windows media center and it went fine. I have a toshiba laptop with no video card and the aero works great. It fixed the problem I was having with my network printer. Make sure you run the vista upgrade advisor BEFORE you buy the upgrade! It will tell you any problems you may have BEFORE you upgrade. The only thing I am dissappointed with is they retired pinball.
1," Very comfortable: I love this pillow. I never liked sleeping on my side, but this has made it seem like second nature. It is very comfortable and for the most part, keeps me on my side. My husband used it when I was out of town, and now he wants one too!I only have two complaints. 1) It is a bit difficult to reassemble after washing the cover. 2) It is a bit difficult to get in and out of bed during the night with it.Would definitely suggest it to others in need of a good pregnancy pillow - definitely worth the $$$."
0," I should have listened to the other reviewers: It looked great coming out of the box, but with the price I should have known it was too good to be true. My zune was about halfway charged and it usually only takes 30 mins with the original charger to charge all the way. I left it plugged in for 1 hour, came back and my battery was dead. It DID connect to my computer, but it DID NOT charge my device. So, yeah... I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!"
0," OH GOD, the pain: I have rarely ever watched a movie as bad as this one. Sure, it's pretty to look at. Sure, it's sometimes funny. But, people, as a watched this movie, I realized what bad acting and terrible directing looked like. How did the excellent Iom Holm get a part in this mess. I guess he lost a bet. This is the Riven of films."
0," NOT Large! This is normal every day cupcake size.: WARNING - UNRETURNABLE, STANDARD SIZE, NOT ""LARGE""......In no way, shape, or form, are these LARGE baking cups. I read the 2.5 inch and dutifully measured the bottom circumference of my large muffin pans..., which were exactly 2.5 inches across the bottom. Imagine my surprise when these arrived and they were your standard size, been making them since I was a kid, cupcake liner. Then, what fun! I find out that I can't return them to get the right size. I now have a lifetime supply of cupcake liners that I will never use, and I have to make 1200 LARGE brownie muffins in less than two days."
1, Loved them: If your radio has an amplifier or if you take the time to actually tweak all your radio bass and treble setting these sound amazing! and actually produce a pretty nice thump. For anyone rating these below 4 stars.. well I guess they didnt know what they were doing.
0, Wow ! all 5 stars ? 14 reviwers ? Are they real ?: I almost click to buy this book. It seems good from the mouths of 14 readers. But.... wait ... why all the 14 reviewers wrote their reviews around the same date ? and the same Annie from NYC wrote two 5 stars reviews on Jan 6 & 7 respectively ? Are these reviews really written by real readers ?
1, What a great value!: The book arrived in perfect condition soon after the order was placed. All was as promised....The book ias a great addition to my reference library and I could not beat this price anywhere.
0," Plum gone rotten: Brown wrote two doppelgangers that copy the structure and style of this book: ""Angels and Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"". And those two were better by far. Once again, Brown writes about a woman who is both a genius and graced with a supermodel's body. Her other half is a very attractive, intelligent professor (they're always professors).The language is a thin butter of overused clichés scraped over too many details of what the characters look like and how they function on a daily basis. The reader isn't allowed to use their imaginations because Brown is too busy nailing down every person, place and thing with exact and dreary verbiage.I'm not a Brown-basher. I enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"" for their entertainment value. But, perhaps I can only stomach two Brown books before the novelty wears off, and this was the third that pushed me to the brink. Had I read ""The Da Vinci Code"" third, I may be complaining about it instead. But I'm not."
0," Not that great: I love the show. I love the concept. I just think they were trying a little to hard here. I think Peter Reckell is ok at best, and I find that the songs are very formulaic (did I spell that right?). Kyle is great, but I enjoyed him more on the show and other CDs he's been on. Arianna is pleasant, Nadia is obvious but again, this is trying toohard to be a 'real' album and it's not. I agree that it's over produced in spots, and while the songs aren't crap, they're mediocre.Jenny"
0, No fun for Girls: This was for my granddaughter to use on my computer when she visits. It will not work. I was not able to install these games on my newer computer. The supporting software was way out of date. My son was able to install some of the games on his old couputer but they didn't play very well. This is out of date and not worth the money
1, great -- also works strictly ethernet--ethernet: I have 4 of these and have had them since last July 2000 before they got cheaper. 2 at home piggybacked so that one handles the public IPs I have on my iDSL and one is plugged into that one to handle all the 192.168.* type NAT addresses. Works great. I only wish the uplink port was 100bTX too. Also have 1 with a spare configured already at my colocate server location at an ISPs in another state. works great as a pure ethernet to ethernet router. That one is routing a whole class c where 50 addresses are in use. Only problems were some config problems and utter lack of manual info (last summer at least) on how to set up advanced features.
1," Glutino Pretzels are great!: If you are a Celiac, or are gluten intolerant, you won't find a better pretzel than the Glutino brand. I have them on Auto-Delivery with Amazon."
1," Great for the price: I am very happy with this, have had no problems since I bought it almost a year ago. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't just go buy replacement brushes at the store and they cost almost as much as the toothbrush itself."
0, Terrible and disgusting: I ordered these caramels and was very much disappointed there were ants inside the bag of caramels which they ended inside the individually wrapped caramels as well.. A waste of my money and will never order this here again!!! This never happened at [...] SMH..
0," The final Fall of the Third Republic: The collapse of France in 1940 was the last in the chain of political and military defeats. First it was lost ""the battle of Czechoslovakia"" (politicaly) and then the campaign in Poland. Unfortunately, the author don't give a fair evaluation of this events. On the contrary. He quoted Marshall Petain (and agree with him), who after the disaster in 1940 maintained that one of the reasons of the collapse were ""too few allies"". Sorry, but the reality was completely ""the other way round"". It were French, who let down first Czechoslovakia in Munich and then, one year later, Poland."
0," The 1995 Genealogy Annual: The book arrived promptly and in new condition. Unfortunately, it is so out-of-date and contains so little information as to be worthless to any researcher with a computer."
0," Kenny Rogers: This was a disappointment in that Kenny did not dominate the program with his talent and songs but rather to his dedication to philanthropy. Of course, caring about others at Christmas does have merit, but if you are looking for great songs go elsewhere. There is some nice variety and pleasant dancing numbers, but not nearly enough."
0," Throw it OUTKAST: I've listened to this dual CD set several times, and I'm disappointed with this latest Outkast production. I've been listening to this duo since they first came out, and I feel that Big Boi and Andre 3000 are better served (just like the fans) when they combine their strengths into one CD instead of going solo on each one. There are a couple tracks that I like from each one, namely Big Boi's ""Tomb of the Boom"" and Andre's ""Happy Valentine's Day"", and I also like the change of pace from their usual foray, but it doesn't work. Instead of getting Big Boi's gangsta apporach and Andre's snappy funk combined into each track, we get each artist's specialties seperately, and like the duality of man, one doesn't work without the other."
1," ""Twisted Whiskers"" fixes your crazy cat.: I found ""Twisted Whiskers"" to be very helpful. I originally purchased the book for my son to help with his kitten's behavior issues but, after receiving the book and reading through it I found advice in it that helped with my four cats who are between ages 6 and 17. I found you can teach an old cat new tricks! I would heartily recommend this book to anyone with cat issues.Twisted Whiskers: Solving Your Cat's Behavior Problems"
1," Disney Lovers Dream: If you love animations from Disney, or the Disney success story, this is a must buy. My Wife loves this."
1, Boopie: Wonderful movie. Very informative and well composed. Powerful actors and the setting was very real and believable. I recommend it to any audience.
1, Captivating Reading: A book you won't put down till you'v read the last page and then you will still be wanting more. Vampires--an age old story with a great new twist that finally brings them into the 21st century with new powers and a romance that will defy time. The author does a excellent job in tying the old with the new giving the vampire something they could never quite grasp and hold on to...true love. If you like vampire stories you will love this one...its a must read...a book that will stay with you long after your finished reading it.
0," Not interesting at all: Shapiro does a really a great job in Globe trecker Mexico city. I cannot appreciate all of the sexual inuendos. I think people sheould come to their own conclusions, especially when it comes to art. I also do not rate highly her friends as she travels. I think she could find people with more class. Most of us who travel like to enjoy good travel information with some class. I do however like Globe trekker Belgium and Luxembourg. Those were well presented and classy."
0," Horribly made after 2 pair I got the hint..: Unfortunately it took me 2 pair to realize this product is shoddily made. Both myself and another transcriptionist purchased these. They were wonderful! They cancelled out most of the office noise; however, after about 3 weeks her right ear bud went out and less than a week later my left. She went back to $20 ear buds and I stupidly got another pair. Bingo 3 weeks later the left went out again. I didn't want to go through the hassle of dealing with Sony but I figured at least one person might be warned to save their money."
0," Little substance, fair reproductions: Another book on the overblown impressionists. Little commentary and fair reproductions. A perfect book to put on your coffee table with your Renoir coasters. Souveneir book only."
0," Amen to that One Fatal Flaw: As has been discussed in other reviews, that ""fall asleep"" attribute is extremely annoying. Sometimes you feel like you need to slam it against the wall to wake the blasted thing back up. I returned mine for a refund.I suppose it's a ""feature"" to preserve battery life. I think I can afford to buy a few more batteries, thank you. If the manufacturers really want this ""feature,"" then they should have provided a mechanism that allows the user to configure it. E.g., ""go to sleep"" after 15 minutes of inactivity instead of 2.I should add that the software package that comes with it has problems as well. In particular, there's a ""sonar"" feature that locates the mouse pointer for you when you press the ""Ctrl"" key. Unfortunately, this feature ""breaks"" too easily, especially if you try it after the mouse has ""gone to sleep."" Then it won't work again until after a reboot. (My system is Win98 1st Edition; obviously your mileage may vary on other versions of Windows.)"
0," Tall Tales of Lost Mines: A lot of fictional tales of legendary silver/gold mines heavily embellished by Dobie. Not much character development, just a list of events and people, usually non-miners, who found a rich vein by accident, let it lie for some reason, then came back months or years later and couldn't relocate the find. The finds were always high-grade ore, or even solid silver/gold, and always disappeared. Cowboys and indians, ranchers and soldiers, yada, yada, yada. Badly illustrated, no maps worth mentioning.For the story of a real miner, who found real ore, experienced actual life-threatening events, and lived to tell about it, get Deep Enough by Frank Crampton. Much, much better than this tripe."

1," Sabroso y Swinging: I was familiar with this all-star group of Cuban expats from the discs Cuba L.A. and Cuba L.A. Dos, both of which I reccomend, without reservation, to anyone interested in Latin music. But I thought the idea of Cubanized arrangements of American Christmas Carols was goofy. After all, Cubanos don't grow up singing these tunes around the arbolito. After 60 seconds of the first cut, Let It Snow, I knew how wrong I was. This group uses these melodies as a basis for some swinging mambos, cha cha chas and guaguancos. You'll be dancing before the first tune is over."
1, Great Set: My father in law just loves this series and is going to start buying all his series sets from Amazon!
1, Spectacular Shoe !: This shoe is as attractive as the picture. The fit is excellent. It is worth 2 or 3 times more than I paid. Best deal I've had in a long time.
0," Ah, the joys of getting your scrapbooks published.: If only *I* could get paid to publish MY photo albums! Admittedly, his are full of famous people while mine are full of people nobody knows, but still--the pictures are only occasionally actually revealing (Liz Montgomery and her former husband playing mind games); the rest are your standard ""Smile at the camera"" variety. The style of the book doesn't really lend itself well to any in-depth self-analysis, but please, you need one or the other (good pictures, good writing). Mr. Dunne, I love you, but you're in need of a good editor and shouldn't be allowed to run loose with every passing whim."
1," A wonderful book!: I couldn't stop reading this wonderful story full of rich, well-developed, intelligent, humorous characters!"
0," 10 year old wouldn't take them: These chewable wafers are larger than I expected...just a little smaller than the size of a quarter. My 10 year old daughter just couldn't stand chewing them. We couldn't get one down much less the recommended two. I am glad they work for others, just not us. For now we will just stick with our omega supplements, they seem to help her behavior and focus. We take the lemon lime Coromega and she loves the flavor."
1," Hilarious and Offbeat: I laughed from begining to end. I watched it with my 13 year old boy and 16 year old girl. We agree on very few movies, but we all loved this one."
0," cc's review: After playing Sly two and three, Sly one was really slow. My two kids would have liked it better if we had't played one and two."
1," Great for a bedroom: I have this in my master bedroom. I could not be happier. I read my books on it and relax. A little short if you want to sleep, your feet hang off the end, but if I get sleepy I just go lay on my bed. Love the storage! Looks totally classy in my room!"
1, Don't overlook this album!: I have appx. 300 CDs and I've been listening to hard rock/metal for close to 30 years. This album is in my top ten. Every song is great and has so many cool riffs it'll make your head spin. This is the band Metallica wishes it could be.
0," DRM (when everyone else has ditched it): If I go to a bookstore and buy a book, it's mine.If I go to Amazon & buy an e-book it's theirs.I was VERY seriously considering buying a Kindle until they withdrew books that people had paid for. Imagine Sunday afternoon, my son goes to complete his school project on a famous book, turns on the Kindle and its not there.Now I know it's crippled by DRM (when everyone else has ditched it) why should I throw my money away?"
0," Save the trouble and go with linksys or something else: (...) Apparently there is a software problem (shipped product with wrong software from what i'ev heard). I'm not a pro at all as far as computer but i do have determination, i spent about 7 hours trying to figure this thing out and i ended up getting the solution from some one else on a dell forum. they told me that they have the same chip as the ones from many other companies so i downloaded some drivers from linksys support, fiddled with them for about an hour becuase i wasen't completly sure how to update the card with those drivers but it randomly fixed the problem and it's all good. the card is through about 4 layers of drywall and upstairs (about 100 feet) and it's still geting 3 out of 5 bars and 48mbps."
1," We are the Wolf!: Jim Brandenburg succinctly captures the essence of the wolf. The wolf has been so unfairly persecuted throughout our history; due on no small part to ranchers. Incredible photographs, this book will make you a wolf lover if you aren't already. Incredible text and photos!!!!"
0," Too many false alarms, driving us nuts!: We just bought a brand new home and our builder had installed these as smoke alarms. After 3 weeks of moving in, the alarms started going off for a few seconds at a time. There was no smoke and we weren't even cooking anything at the time. We checked the battery and even replaced them, but still, nothing. The noise is annoying! Gives me headaches! Please avoid these if you can!"
1," Great deal!: This boot is a really vivid red and appears true to the featured picture. I liked the boots on sight, but the $25 price essentially sealed the deal for me. Since it's not winter yet, I haven't worn them outside, but I can tell they are quite warm just from trying them on -- my feet were hot! My only quibble is that the cut is a little funky and I can only get the boot on by placing it on the floor and stepping into it. There's clearly some sort of cardboard type material in the heel portion that collapses somewhat easily if you try to pull the boot on. I also agree with the reviewer that suggested ordering a half size up to allow for winter socks."
1, Awesome CD Awesome Band Awesome Music: This CD is absolutely awesome. Blindside blows complacent rock bands out of the water. I've never experienced such talent in a hard-metal band. Their music is far from dry; they take their music seriously--every track is listenable. I've come across one of their music videos on a dvd under the other record label they were under---excellent. I love how this band isn't afraid to be themselves. They aren't afraid of being creative--They're bold; I totally respect that. It's cool how they're Christian without being bound by the Christian stigma and so musically cultivated. Be careful if you buy this cd used--some z-shop merchants are selling promo cd's (they're stamped on front)--selling promo cd's is prohibited even though they may be brand new. Promo cd's also usually contain less art and pictures.
0," Not worth a dime!: I have purchased every Star Trek video game there is. This one is by far the worst. First, it is very unstable. I have the most recent patches installed but the damn thing will still not stay running. Second, the documentation is very poor. You are left on your own trying to figure out how to play. Third, tech support from the developers is non-existent.I wish I could return it and get my money back."
1, Bucky the Book Dude: All of the features are easy to use and reception is great. I can honestly say that I am extemely pleased with this purchase.
0," Everyone who says this is a pale copy of Tolkien is absolutely right: This book was originally written as a sequel to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, or so the Wikipedia page on Dennis McKiernan says. Then McKiernan could not get the rights to create a sequel, so he messed with the names of people and species and published the books anyway. It's easy to see that this is the case because the book is a completely slavish imitation of Tolkien's story and Tolkien's world, only altered in not-at-all-subtle ways that only serve to diminish the original LOTR story into a pale and unsatisfying imitation.Don't waste your money."
0," Wait, what the heck just happened?: Okay, let me be fair...the first two books were pretty good. Actually, when Garald taught Joram how to fence in Doom of the Darksword, I found that to be one of the greatest scenes in fantasy I've read lately. HOWEVER...what the heck happened? It's like, Joram leaves and then comes back and they don't explain it and why the heck is he friends with the military and who is Menju and what's wrong with Gwen, and, we all want to know, who the heck is Simkin? This book is lame lame lame lame!!! I read fantasy to escape from the toils of life (lol) and man, there was like Desert Storm happening in this book. Honestly, I expected Stormin' Norman to show up and save the day. This book is like a bad dream. It's awful too since the first two were so great!!! Read the first two, and like one of the other reviewers said, make up your own ending. Oh yeah, and they never explained why the people procreate like they do..."
0," Disappointed: After being extremely satisfied with another Tolo product, I ordered this one and was disappointed. The girl does not fit well into the car and will frustrate a child. The button that starts the car does not always engage unless you push it several times, more frustration. And when engaged it only travels about half as far as the other tolo vehicle I purchased. I returned it for a refund and will look for something else."
0," Only Potok book I've read and not liked: I wanted to love this book. I expected to love this book. Found an old copy of this in a thrift shop and wondered why I'd never seen it in book shops. Then I read it. I've loved everything else I've read by Chaim Potok, but this book dragged. I felt it had no build, no climax, just kinda strolled along, and then, THE END. I more or less forced my self to finish reading it in stubbornness, and in hopes that the book would pick up, but no... throughout the book I found myself not really caring about any of the characters much.Now, admittedly, I am not Jewish, and and I have only a surface understanding of Kabbalah. While my limited experiences with Judaism has never previously kept me from falling head over heals for a Potok book, it's quite possible that --in this particular case-- it might be ignorance keeping me from seeing any depth to this book."

1," Baikida and the Heartbreakers: Beautiful playing here by Baikida and friends. Sounds that will remind you of the glorious Blue Note years. The ballads I Need, I Thought You Knew, and Against Your Warmth will melt you beyond recognition. Ballads in the same league as Iris, Infant Eyes, and Alfred. Need I say more? Baikida is a brilliant musician with a great sound. I only wish that we heard more fom him."
0," idolotry nonsense: first, being the parent is what bonds the child, not pain and pain in birth an insult and danger to the proccess. Birth is painful due to large brain. Could ""birth"" be metaphorical? If that aproach of mine bothered you, then dont read this because that is her angle, but with a different priority or opinion. This reaks of an abuser saying you are so lowly buy i'll use you, and you give him praise. whould you like to study without denial , edcuses and ego defense mechomism, stockhom sydrome or lawyer type twists? There are paragraphs of her thought contrasted to one verse refrence. Still, one can tell what comes from the authors mind, and what kind of person she is instead of reading the bible first hand and letting that be self evident. She seems like a gracious kind person.Good thing she asks you to look at any event from the woman's p.o.v."

1," Chill Pad: Arrived on time and in excellant condition. It works very well, my laptop is much more comfortable to use."
0," Odor-FULL Diaper Pail: This diaper pail definitely does not live up to its' name! This pail will smell with even one dirty diaper in it. We have been throwing our soiled diapers in our regular trash instead... it smells less there. The deodorant tablet is held in place by a cup that kept falling into the pail until we finally just took it out completely. Our 1 year old son has no problem opening the ""child resistant"" closure. The lid doesn't always stay closed... it often pops open a few seconds after you close the lid. All in all... we are definitely getting a new pail before our second child is born and we have even more diapers."
1, Great value and lots of fun.: There are so many dolls in this book and each has many outfits. Each one is done with a great deal of detail.The quality of the paper is wonderful and will survive lots of play. I loved the fact that most outfits have hats to go with them.
1," Nothing better than Sequence!: I have had many many fun parties with this game. Kids, adults, everyone together - can't get better than this. Everyone I play this game with gets hooked and no one ever gets to go to bed during a tournament we play at home."
1, OBrian Novels: Excellent series and always captures the mind and puts you in the place the author wants you to be. You get a real tatse of the early shipping history and events. At the end of each of the novels its time to get another and continue reading.
1," Challenging but with some flaws: First, let me just say I enjoyed this book and was challenged and convicted through it. His main premise and the exposition of it are of great value to the Church today. This book is not without flaws though. It is a bit confusing to follow at times, seeming a bit choppy. He also seems to stretch his point at times to make it fit the context of passages he is reading. If this was changed the book would probably be at least 50 pages shorter. Perhaps the biggest downfall of the book is that Fee seems blinded by his Pentecostal traditions, which is so shocking because he is a master expositor. This comes out clearly in many instances, specifically chapters 12-14. His backing of speaking in tongues is found wanting whereas his exegesis in many other points is superb.I do recommend this book, but come into this book with a mind ready to think and perhaps read slowly at times."
0, Item not as described. DO NOT PURCHASE: Technical Details claims the item to be 3H'(3 feet). If you go further down to the Product Description way down to the page you will see that the item is actually on 16 inches. This is very deceiving. They got me don't let them get you.

0," Marv! read your own book you time waster: What he has to say could be boiled down to about 5 pages.Don't complain, don't make excuses, don't justify, work hard, work smart, keep learning, buy real estate, start a business, think BIG, tell yourself its ok to be rich and ok to have money. Break out of any subconcious negative money conditioning you may have from your childhood. OK make that 1/4 page.You will not get your ""fianacial blueprint"" from this book, you will have to go to a seminar for that.His stories seem so contrieved you would think he made them up just for this book as filler. Marv say it aint so.This is a book for tiny minds."
1," WOW, AWESOME: Seriously only bought this for my halloween costume as a one time prop, but WOW. This is a real sword! sharp, steel, greatly made! I expected a crap thing that i would throw away after a very fun night but this is a keeper, it is beautiful! Great work!! Me and my friends have fun shredding things and seeing what else can we cut hahaha"
1," We get to be the pirates, this time: For the first 1/2 of this book I was totally lost. Disconnected events, murder, double cross, spy games, the seemingly unrelated story lines had me going for a while. It all DOES come back together for the final 1/2 of the book, but the motivation for the Russian Admiral defecting to the US because his wife died sounds suspiciously like the motivation for the sub commander in Tom Clancy's ""Hunt for Red October"" . This book was published 1988. Which came first? ""S.S.N. Skate""or ""Hunt..."""
0, very dificult to operate: I would not recommend this scale. it's too complicated and the buttons are not comfortable!
0," Do not waste your time reading Factory of Death: Shame on the editor that let this book see the light of day. The thoughts are jumbled, the prose awkward, and the grammar and punctuation often incorrect. The characters are poorly drawn stereotypes that stumble through a ridiculously overwrought plot.The one bright spot is that this book can forever serve aspiring writers as an example of what NOT to do."

0," tired of it: Must we indulge yet another collection of tripe in the guise of self-help? Didn't we get this sort of nonsense out of our systems a long time ago?If you are the type who hangs around in the self-help section of Borders looking for something you haven't yet read, hoping the nice-looking man ordering the latte isn't as bad as your ex-husband, well, sure, pick this up. You can read it a few hours later after you've snuck that man past your sleeping children's doors and out to his car, and feel good about yourself and how wonderful a person you are for reading something like this.For the rest of us that live with a real sense of morality, well, we know books like this are just excuses - a mechanism by which the anointed democrat leftists sanctify themselves. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure why I wrote this review. If it offended you, you're beyond help. If it rang true, you already know you don't want to get anywhere near this book."
1," Great Antenna and Cheap HDTV!: I picked this up just to have for free HDTV. When I bought my new TV, I realized that all my local channels were broadcast in HD. All I needed was a way to pick them up. This antenna does a very good job. When my DirecTV goes out during a hard rain, this comes in very handy."

0," LoFi ear buds: I own a pair of HD-595 and purchased a pair of HD-497 as a gift for my brother. They are excillent for the prices. I did not hesitate to place the order after briefly reading the reviews. Well, disapointed.Too much highs, bass has no depth. Try removing the rubber cover, they sound cheaply. The worst thing is the mids, badly distorted. Changing the rubber cover may help a little bit with the bass, depending on your ears but mids can not be corrected.I was afraid of the fake products, so I purchased them directly from Amazon. I trusted Senn so much that I just tossed away the box and all the papers. Now I'm just wondering if I can return these."
1," love them but mostly for women: Love this product... have gotten many over the past 3 years..It is a women's product tho unless the man has a small frame. Even with the adjustment, the frame isn't big enough for a medium/large man."
1," Litter box cleaning made easy: This is a really easy litter box to clean. The cats seem to like it because It is covered, deep and I clean it more often since it is easy.The one flaw? is really more of paying attention to how you put it together. If it isn't done right, litter will fly out, but this is strictly a consumer error.You have to make sure everything is snapped into place to use, but I liked it so much I now own two."
0," Nothing useful that you couldn't learn yourself: Bill Phillips is at it again. With his Sports Supplement Review the founder and owner of supplement company EAS disguised a marketing piece as a semi-informative discussion of nutrition as it relates to bodybuilding. This book is yet another attempt by Phillips to sell his overpriced and generally ineffective supplements. His writing motivates some people to better themselves. Me, I can't get past his smarmy, self-congratulatory attitude. ""Shawn, warm up the private jet!?"" Please."
1," Excellent and comprehensive guide to Oriental rugs: While I own a few rugs from a previous trip to the Middle East courtesy of Uncle Sam, I wanted to better educate myself to place myself into a better bargaining position with the local merchants. I believe this book is an excellent resource and explains a great deal about the history, workmanship, and variety of Oriental carpets, but it also includes tips on how to shop (including haggling), how to pick rugs based on your home, and cleaning and care recommendations. The only downside is the age of the commentary since the market has changed, at least from what I see, since this book was written. Nevertheless, it is a great introduction to the fascinating and beautiful world of Oriental rugs."
1," Greatest game ive ever seen: I`ve been gaming 4 my whole life, and i`ve never seen a game like this... just by reading a few reviews i can tell this is a a great rpg. those if apearence is important in it then its kinda bad that the more u use will, the older u grow. ive never heard of a game with ai this great so thats one big step up from the stupid ppl in other games. I think this game will come very close or possibly match its expetations"
0, Bad movie: A very bad movie. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this poor remake in the theaters. Wish it had been more like the TV show.
1," This should be called the `Perfect Partner': I used the Partner EF400T on my trip to Paris last week and just wanted to say that it was perfect - hence the name `Perfect Partner'! The French are not known for speaking English easily (even if they can speak it perfectly well) and this little gadget saved my skin on a more than a couple of occasions. Being as `nationalistic' as they are, I thought it would be better to keep my mouth shut :) I entered what I wanted to say and it actually spoke it out right away. The people I used it on where much more receptive to the device than me But without it I think my trip would have been sooooo bad."
1," Works Great: Maybe I should have given it 4 stars instead of 3, It works without any problems with good sound and stereo but one issue that's irritating. Say you drop your remote on the floor as soon as you bend and reach for it those head phones are going to fall to the floor guaranteed. Its happen every time for whatever reason I go to pick something up off the floor. If these were over the ears cushion I guess this would not happen. If they fit tightly they stay on but would hurt and be uncomfortable.So I'm trying to remember to place a hand on them when bending over. I still would recommend these and would buy again.Upped it one star for working great for 1 year. Only thing is the foam covering over ear phones are starting to show there ware, should have came with some spares."
0," Not worth reading: Most of the time I love Kimberly Cates work, but this time I was really disappointed. This book was really slow going, only the last 50 pages are worth reading. This story could have been told in a lot less pages. The usual chemistry was not there."

1," Great book, but a letdown from ""Pretty Horses"": This is an undeniably beautifully written book and wonderful story, but was a little less of a personal favorite than was the first book of this Border Trilogy. McCarthy dropped a bit of the power and simplicity of language of ""All The Pretty Horses"" and instead became much more wordy and allegorical. I appreciated the straight-ahead story of the first book that also managed to project a lasting emotion at the same time. In The Crossing, the language was as beautiful, but there were often stories and sub-plots that stalled out the otherwise fast and engaging book. These asides seemed to have been added to build depth in the characters, but for me weakened the story."

1," Prototyp by Hurdy-Gurdy: This group is... different, to say the least. They use sound bytes from the medieval instrument, The Hurdy-Gurdy, aka Crank Fiddle, aka I-could-never-play-one. This album is all instrumental, and has the ability to put you in a trance like state. This is not an in-the-car album. Before purchasing, look at their last-fm, or check the song ""Delirium"" out on playlist.com. I love this album, but I seriously doubt they'll make another. Their Myspace page hasn't been logged on to since 2007, and the music they have is a niche-ish style. You can't do much for a follow-up, unless the throw in a vocalist or percussion. Hell, give is an Apocalyptica setup, and then maybe you can have a follow up. But over all, this album is unique and deserves attention from those who enjoy trance music and light techno."

0, Awful: This is absolutely awful. Game is quite boring and lacks the ability to save your profile. This means every time you have to power up you have to register a profile. My children are ages 6 through 11 and this will not do for either of them. WII Word coach is the only good one that they sell as far as I can tell so far.
0," Cute but doesn't hold up.: I liked this one because it was not pink as I was purchasing it for my two sons. However, it continually falls apart and now the wheels don't work very well. I would recommend spending a bit more money and purchasing something more durable. I wish I would have done that."
1," A great way to spice up your life!: For the devoted pepper aficionado, this book is all business. The book provides scores of delectable recipes and informs the reader of what makes up the chili pepper. A history lesson or two is included at no extra cost. The recipe for habanero paste is outstanding, especially on my favorite local pizza. Relocation to Pittsburgh is required for the pizza, sorry. Warning, the purchase of this book results in a better diet and a truly wise pepper consumer. You will be the center of attention at parties and the opposite sex will flock toward you in droves. O.K., I'm exaggerating you may just experience the state of Zen"

They are a bit large, but shouldnt be a problem if you have swallowed pills before. You can cut them in half if they pose a problem, but swallow them quickly because the taste isnt too pleasant. People seem to trust the claims of centrum and other vitamin makers, so I hope that its money well spent. In honesty, I feel it changes the color of my urine, but probably doesnt provide my body with all the vitamins it claims. I dont think the body can really handle all of them in a magic pill. Who knows? Not me..."
0, poor suction: This bath mat did not stick to my bathtub. Only a few of the suction tabs would stick. When I filled the bathtub the mat would just float to the top. I Would not recommend this bath mat to anyone!!
1," Good Insight: The book is very informative and offers some new insights or avenues on flexibility. Nevertheless, it uses terms that would be unfamiliarized by novices or beginners. In addition, more details should be included when describing how to perform individual exercises. In general, it is a very good reference and companion book if you also own the video/DVD copy on the same title."
0," Primary Colors with a more vindictive approach.: I enjoyed Shelley's Heart, and looked forward to reading McCarry's latest. However, this transparent attack on Clinton quickly grows boring. There are some nuggets of a solid thriller, but these are buried by McCarry's personal agenda."
0," UNCHARISMATIC POP SINGER -------- HORRIBLE MUSIC .: Listening to this horribly boring singer gave me a headache.Its truly the worst music Ive ever heard. If you want to hear great music , DONT buy this crappy cd ."
1," Hooray it fits!: Trying to replace the flap for a dog door purchased several years ago was a chore. Measurements don't match mine and I can't remember what the name of the door type was. Fortunately, the measurements were clear and the picture of the product looked like mine. It fits perfectly and we have a brand new, clean, and not ripped dog door. Too bad the dog did't notice it and appreciate it as much."
1," Awsome!!: Love the band (music plus live performance) I saw scenes on youtube and this was a must have for all Swedinsh Death Metal Fans. The person I bought the Dvd send it quick and excelent condition, I am very please!"
1," An original story with a great cast: This is a touching and offbeat movie with an excellent cast and a great script.Two former schoolmates meet again many years later after one has had a sex change. The story deals with how they tentatively reestablish a friendship. Neither character knows how to deal with the unique situation in which there are no rules. As they learn about each other, each also learns more about himself.Rupert Graves and Steven Mackintosh give standout performances in the lead roles. A well-written script and sensitive direction make this movie well worth seeing."
1, Awesome chapter books with great story lines: The Magic Tree House books are full of great adventure and capture the readers attention. Readers enjoy a little science fiction along with a little history combined with vocabulary expanding fun!! My child recommends the entire series so much that we gave the first set of books to her cousins for Christmas!... and thanks to Amazon they were a great price!!
1," Not needed, but still helpful.: ""Spark Notes A Doll's House"" was helpful in clearing up small, subtly plot facts, but the play is so straightforward, that ""Spark Notes"" is essentially unnecessary. I ""sorta"" recommend."
0," No usefull at all: I bought this book expecting to have some biger knowledge on VB topics. Is just for beginners, any information here you can find it better from microsoft site.Waste of 59.00"
0," Not Quite The Taste I Thought It Would Be: This CD features 77 minutes of songs from Laos, Thailand, China, and Indonesia. Dengyue jiaohui reminded me of bluegrass more than other traditional Chinese songs I have heard. I was a little disappointed in this CD. The CD does come with an 8 page booklet that describes, in English, what the songs are about and the meaning behind them. If you are looking for Asian music, you may want to bypass this one."
1," This book captures the essence of why I've skated for 20 yrs: I got Skateboarder mag, until they flamed out and went ""all purpose"" with Action Now... then Thrasher became my staple. I skated crappy Val Surf boards, decent Sims boards, hip Alva and DogTown models... even skated a Jay Adams Z-Flex... now I surf my Sector nine. This book is the ROOTS book or the CIVIL WAR series for our much-misunderstood sport. Skate hard or go home."
0," Oahspe Is Pure Bunk!: Sounds like the same old crap...""manna from on High."" Everything is this book is pure BUNK. Oops! My Oahspe Bunk detector is going off! The only thing this book is good for is brainwashing the un-educated. Only a moron would find this dribble readable.Move over Jim Jones, here comes Oahpse!"
0," Poor vocal talent and unfounded lyrics.: If I could give this album less than one star I would. Brent Burns has virtually no vocal talent which obviously why he only lays on the beach while Jimmy Buffett (spelled with two ""T's) counts his money. It sounds as if he tape-recorded the album on a home stereo system with a Karaoke function. I also found the song ""If It's Snowbird Season Why Can't We Shoot 'Em?"" to be interesting since the beach he lays on is not located in Florida but in Alabama. Maybe he should stick to writing about the ten mile stretch of land he uses as a beach instead of writing about Florida beaches for which he was a tourist on as well. In short do not waste your money on this CD your money is better spent on something credible."
1, Terrycloth robe: Plenty big for me but I am a small framed woman so don't know how the one size would work for all. Fabric is very good quality and absorbent...just what I was looking for. Very pleased.
1, Memorable: Truly a film that stays with you for many years. In my late teens I found this to be a very inspirational film. It encouraged respect and discovery of native peoples and their ways and dealt with the often difficult issue of faith communities and their relations with aboriginal peoples.
1," Pleased!: Thanks to the reviews on the Maximo, I purchased this item and have found the positive comments to be true. I am very pleased."
1, Great show!: Interesting show. I love to follow celebrities as they search for their lineage. It's great to see the different countries and events their ancesters were involved in.
0," Zero stars should be an option: I bought this book, along with the same publisher's book on Physics, and they are both completely worthless. They are like fake books. Someone spent a lot of time making a clean orderly layout, and then someone else dropped in a bunch of text that doesn't follow a logical sequence or actually teach anything. For example, the first chapter, entitled ""Matter and the Periodic Table of Elements"" begins with a few paragraphs explaining the Scientific Method--nothing at all about matter or the periodic table. This block of text is immediately followed by a series of ""Practice"" questions that all relate to matter--but you have not been introduced to any of the concepts yet, so there's no way to know the answers! Every single page evokes the same confused response. These are really weird books. So glad I saved my receipt--I'm bringing them back to the store today."
1," Shining a Light on Utilities: This was as a reading assignment for a sustainability elective I took during my MBA. It is an historical account of developments in the utility industry in the U.S. during the 60's, 70's and 80's, from the persepctive of the author, who had first hand involvement. His account gives some interesting insight into how publlic utilities are managed and often mis-managed."
1, Excellent User Interface: I have upgraded from 2.0 to 3.0 and the user interface is excellent. The palette tabs are all organized to one side and can be hidden from view to create more workspace.The organizer bin is one great addition where you can see open pictures and quickly select to work between them. The integration of the Album with the editor is smooth and works very well on my old Pentium 1GHZ 512 MB RAM notebook. Everytime I learn new ways to approach a task. And it's amazing.I have created a PAL based Slide show on a CD-R and it works flawlessly in India.
0," Close but no cigar: It was worth a try for the price but! It is very hard to adjust just right and every time you clean your glasses it needs to be readjusted.When you have it adjusted right it works OK not great. Its just easier and safer to turn my head around and look. When you use the mirror it takes you vision / concentration off the road in front of you. Like I said it was worth a try but it only made 2 rides till it was tossed in with the rest of my junk, like golf training aids etc."
1," THIS CD IS NOT FOR BACKSTREET BOY-LOVING TEENY BOBBERS!!!: YOU KNOW, I AM SOOOOO TIRED OF PEOPLE S*ITING ON THIS BAND. IF YOU'RE DISGUSTED WITH THE COVER, OR YOUR MOMMY GOT MAD AT YOU WHEN SHE CAME IN YOUR ROOM AND HEARD THE CD, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. THIS BAND MUST BE MATURE IF THEY CAN SING ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF WITHOUT GIVING A *** ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK. HELL, YOU PREPS CAN WATCH A PERSON GET SURGERY ON TLC BUT YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS??? ""NO MOMMY, I DON'T LIKE THIS ONE. GET ME THE BRITNEY QUEERS CD!"" WAKE UP, PEOPLE. STOP BEING SUCH BABIES AND JUST *** LISTEN TO THE MUSIC! OTHERWISE, GO OUT AND GET SOME CHRISTIAN STRAIGHT-EDGE CRAP. I COULD CARE LESS, REALLY. BUT CC IS THE ***."
0," Don't see the hype: I don't understand the hype of the Einstein/Mozart stuff. This one in particular, seemed like home video with music laid over. Didn't seem ""educational"" to me. I mailed it to a friend."
0," Directions on bottle are bad.: Bottle says to cut x with scissors. When puppy started sucking on it, to much came out(hole was to big). Milk came out of nose, puppy was dead in an hour :( , if you buy this product don't follow their stupid directions. As a matter of fact, i hope karma catches up with the idiot in charge of labeling. If i would've gone with common sense,i would've just made a hole with a hot needle."
0," No connection for me...: Just ok...I never really felt connected to any character in this book. OK history lesson but I need to feel that connection to really like what I'm reading. twords the end I was excited for it to end so I could move on to other books I had waiting on my Kindle. Sorry, not for me."
1, Memoir: Matha Beck's second memoir. Has her unique style. She's very conflicted about her family and religion of origin and was very brave to publish this. Should shine a light to others with similar circumstances.
1," A Recounting of Childhood to Compare With Angela's Ashes: In ""Restavec"", Jean-Robert Cadet recounts to us in disturbingly matter-of-fact language the outrage that was his childhood in Haiti.The illegitimate son of a wealthy man,he was given into slavery as a gift to his father's former mistress. The brutality of this woman, whom he came to think of as his mother, is recounted in excruciating detail. The facination of this book is in watching this brutalized child realize an escape from this degraded life. The parallels between Jean-Robert Cadet escape from slavery and Frank McCort's escape from abject poverty are very striking. The role of education in their own countries, and their fulfillment as teachers in the U.S. are just two similarities in their stories. ""Restavec"" is an intense read, not relieved by humor. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a tale of human potential and quiet heroism."
0," Stupid and Sick: I've read many of Fern Michaels' books and have enjoyed all of them. I am currently reading Vendetta and am quiting at the halfway point, which I NEVER do. The story is so unbelieveable and stupid, and now it's looking to turn sadistic. I just can't believe this is the same author I've read before!!!"
1," Great Take-Along Toy, Hours of Fun: My 5-year-old daughter received this as a gift several years ago and got many many hours of fun out of it. It is easy to take in and out of the plastic carrying case, which takes up very little room, and is a great toy to take along on trips -- it kept my daughter entertained during her brother's music lessons and at other people's houses. She didn't need any help playing with it -- a big plus! Over the years, we have lost one of the dolls, and probably some of the smaller costume pieces as well, but there are a LOT of outfits included so you don't have to worry that one lost shoe or hat is going to spoil the fun. If I had found this earlier, there are many little girls I would have given it to as a present!"
0," Bibliomancy disguised...: This book makes the patently absurd claim that the presence of eagles, lions, and other common heraldic charges on the national arms of several European nations proves that the Celtic and Saxon-descended nations of the USA, Great Britian, Spain, etc. are really a lost tribe of Isreal. While this may be of interest to biblical literalists, those of us looking for a work on heraldry will give this one a miss."
0," Whaaaaaaaat???????: A woman named Jennifer tries to escape her past. She is released from a mental hospital and instead of heading home she hooks up with some hippies in the desert. This film was made to look like a 70's film, it does a poor job though. The entire movie was confusing and foolish. The clothing was not correct, the slang was incorrect, there was very little gore, and lots of talk. It's one of those films that makes you think you're on something crazy while watching it. I didn't like it much at all. I kept hoping it would get over with, and fast. 1.5 stars out of 5."
0, Copyright protected.: I eagerly put this CD in my computer and the darn thing doesn't play. DON'T buy it. I believe it's part of BMG's new copyright protection scheme. It plays on my kareoke machine. I'm taking this one back. The he!! with BMG.
1," Amazing clarity ... A super bargain !!!: I bought this unit through Amazon / Vanns - a very reliable online seller that I have tried in the past. I am using this speaker with my 80GB iPod 5.5 Video. The sound quality of this speaker is simply amazing! I had an opportunity to do a side by side comparison with a $299 Bose Sound Dock and the Athena is easily 85-90% of the sound quality of the Bose.I also like the fact that the power supply is built-in so there are no adaptors or ugly wall-warts to carry around AND the power supply is 100-240 volts so it can work anywhere in the world without any voltage conversion!The only weak point is the remote - well, it does it's job but very basic ... one really cannot complain at this price point though!"
1," A hit in our house!: My ten month old boy has a new favorite DVD. This show features babies singing via skillful special effects. The result is effective in holding my son's attention. He seems to be in love with these babies that can magically sing. He tries to sing along, which is very nice to see. This is a DVD that I can wholeheartedly recommend."
1, decent product poor shipping: Just received my flush mount for my Garmin 541s. The mount is fine and will meet my needs for flush mounting my chartplotter/sounder. My issue is with the vendor who did a horrible job of packing the mount. It was jammed into a priority mail package without any regard for the contents. Fortunately it arrived intact.
1," rose: the little Sony works wellI just it to carry around from room to room while working at homelight, clean design, compact"
1," If you like romance you will like Lisa Kleypas: I have just recently discovered Lisa Kleypas. I first read Smooth Talking Strangerand realized this was a third book of a series. I enjoyed it so much I went onAmazon and ordered the first two, Sugar Daddy and Blue Eyed Devil.I enjoyed all three. There is a lot of humor and romance. I couldn't put themdown.Although I live in the South, our weather has been quite cold. It was a perfecttime to cozy up and get lost in a good romance.At first I thought Sugar Daddy was a little slow and wasn't sure I was going to likeit. But then I realized you had to really know the history of Hardy and Libertyand the story really came together.I am partial to modern day books more than historical romance. In researching LisaKleypas I noticed most of her book dealt with historical romanaces and thereforeI didn't read them. I hope she does more modern day books also.Karen, SC"
0," An assault on logic and common sense: mind-blowing rubbish: This book is a tremendous assault on logic that only the rabid neo-right could delight in.It is no secret that the US aided and funded (with the help of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) Islamic extremists in the Afghan war against the Soviet Union. Similarly, the US has long backed a host of dictatorial regimes and overthrown democratic governments in the Middle East (e.g. Iran in the early 1950s) whilst the US today occupies Iraq whilst gearing up for further assaults on Middle Eastern nations.However, and this is the best part: according to this worthless screed, if you dare to mention any of the above you are somehow a supporter of terrorism and an enemy of `AMERICA'. The totalitarian logic of this book is frightening. Simply stated, if you criticise the state you are a traitor. If you want to get an insight into the freedom-hating warped logic of the neo-con right then buy this book. Otherwise don't waste your money."
0, Would not see again: The whole movie needs to be edited. Jokes start off funny but lose it because they go on and on. I think it would have worked if it was a 20 minute short.
1, Nikon Cap: Original Nikon front lens cap. Works great for what it's supposed to do. Not a knock off or cheaply made cap.
0," Just watch it on tv....it comes on almost everyday right now: I kind of liked some of the episodes from season one, but I wouldn't pay close to $30 just to watch something that comes on all of the time on tv. I can't stand Kristen, and she seems to take over season 2, from what I can tell in the previews. So I'm not too happy with it anymore. If you do like this show, just watch it on tv...don't waste your money."
1," its the little things in life we forget...: i wont recap the plot to this film since its already been shown above and by other reviewers. this film shows how things so simple and that are taken for granted by us each day, are very meaningful to people, and particularly to the kids in this film. the accomodations that have to be made for these two kids to be able to attend school and in sharing one pair of worn sneakers really humbles you. to the kids shown here, school is important but important is their recognition of those less fortunate than they are, even though its hard to imagine. a fabulous movie. i think some people may find it a slow pace from the normal western plots of movies in the u.s. but its the slow pace of the film that allows you to appreciate the lives of those shown, and the things that happen throughout the film. it really simplifies life, and makes you think. i recommend this film highly"
0, poor quality: This book is not worth $10.00. Inferior construction and minimal words per page. I bought three editions of the book of Enoch and this was the worst. Save your money and purchase a different edition.
1, Halloween - Resurrection: it is so good the nigth watched i coldn't go to sleep &. Basta Rymes has a good roll in this movie and the way killed Jamie Lee Curtis was great and always wanted to who plays michel
0," Fanfic put into binding: I read this book from the local library, on the misguided presumption that it would be a fun romp through a familiar world.A bit too familiar, however, and I ended up skimming through to the bitter end. The prose is annoying, about on the level of a teenager trying to mimic Austen. The sex is worse, approaching the silliness of romance novels without the visceral thrill of ripping bodices. Although, I think that a bodice may have literally been ripped somewhere in there.There is one silver lining to this mess: fanfic writers take heart, Landmark Press is the place to send your manuscripts. Sure, Star Trek, Harry Potter and Boston Legal are all copyrighted, but just change some names and suddenly you have a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea sequel that will fit in nicely between the shocking 3(!) sequels Berdoll has churned out."
1," Good Book: Good book, very detailed.If your concern is scientific experiments, documented proof and results - this is the one for you.If you already believe in the filed and want to learn how top use it - this is not the one for you."
0, socks for him: These socks are nice thin wool. However they did wear out rather fast.... Guess it depends on what you want them for... heals and toes.. gone. Not for everyday use.
1, Works great!: I use this with a Nuvi 750 in a 2008 Odyssey. It's never slid a fraction of an inch even during hard breaking or fast turns. Plus its easy to grab it with the gps attached and put it on the floor when parked.
0," A terrible product and a worse company: I bought 2 of these hoping to get better wireless coverage throughout my home. I am very technically skilled, but these are a nightmare to set up, and once they are, it is only temporary. If you want to get really frustrated, try contacting their tech support. They throw every roadblock known to man in your way, and when you finally get through the techs are brain dead and rude.I gave them 1 star only because Amazon does not allow zero.Think Amazon will help, forget it."
0," Worthless edition of a good book: The first thing I noticed is that the table of contents wasn't live. In a public domain book selling for $4 I expect that in the formatting. Second, there are no illustrations at all. The original available for free from several places on the web has all of the illustrations.ElaineNorman, Oklahoma"
1, Best Game Ever: Best Board game ever!!!!!love to play it any time!!great for family or friends.and an optional expansion.
1," Amazing, considering it's a student film....: Many great filmmakers rarely show their student work (if they have any). Even the great Kubrick, whose first film Fear and Desire is impossible to find, refused to have his first film shown widely (he called it a failed student exercise). But here is Andrei Tarkovsky's ""diploma"" film (as they called it in the USSR). It is wonderful. It's not Solaris, Rublev, or Stalker, but it's still worth watching over and over again. Tarkovsky was already showing his great individuality with this film. Usually student diploma films were 25 minutes and in black and white. Tarkovsky's film is 50 minutes and is in colour. The relationship between the child and the construction worker is very well done and believable, without any trace of sentimentality that always occurs in films with children (especially in American ones). When watching this, you could tell how talented Tarkovsky was. He's the rare filmmaker that never made a bad film."
1," Just right!: This was exactly what I wanted, and it arrived on time! The pictures could have been a little bigger to make it easier to see it, but it was great!"
1," Dark season: I had heard that the final season was the darkest yet. They weren't kidding. It is very dark, but good. Be prepared for extra violence, I found myself cringing a lot! Can't wait for the other half of the season."
1," Powerful and enriching approach: Personally I haven't listened previous or lately about any other memorable version of Bruckner's Second symphony like this one. Giulini's gracefulness, talent and majestic approach did it once more.Absolutely recommended."
1," I Feel Like I Have Traveled The World!: I was browsing and happened along this book at a local bookstore and it looked intriguing. From the moment I sat down and entered into Joei and Paul's travel across Europe, I felt like I was there with them each step of the way. What a fascinating look into travelling the countries of Europe (and some in Canada and the US)! As we were introduced to the people met and made friends with along the way, the writer made one reading feel as they, too, had meet the acquaintances! I chuckled with them, I travelled along with them and I cried with Joei at the end of the book.This is well worth the adventure into reading and exploring other lands (not in the least textbook dry). Have the Posh Puffs (tissues) on standby!Two thumbs up to Joei Hassock on her writing endeavor!"
1," SO much fun!: This is the perfect game for the little princess in your life! It is easy enough for little ones to enjoy, but challenging enough so its not boring! Great graphics, many different scenes and all the favorite disney characters!"
1," it's the one I carry on me ..........: I love this tape because it works for over 90% of my daily measuring. I gave it 4 stars only because previous reviewers are right in that I had one tear and ultimately break as well. But I did replace it with another, so ..........Well, draw your own conclusion."
1," JR: I am very pleased with the condition of the book since it was used when I purchased it. It came with the 2 required CD's and everything. I would have no problem purchasing anything used from Amazon again. VERY, VERY HAPPY!!!!"
0," Caught on tape: Porn. There was a little bit of information and a lot of porn. Definitely rated R. I was in the same room as my younger brother,but I was on my lap top. I am so glad he was not looking over my shoulder as he often does. I was not even able to finish the episode because of this."
1," Yummy Popcoren: This is my favorite popcorn of all times. It is hard to find popcorn that doesn't have butter on it. This doesn't have butter on it and contains a good combination of sweet and salty. I like the 100 calorie bags although many times I end up eating two. It is hard to find this popcorn in groceries stores, Buying it on Amazon was economical and convenient."
1, Hubbys favorite auto mag.: My husband is the head of a college Automotive Technology department. He's read all of the mags put out there for auto enthusiasts and loves this one by far.
0," Defective DVDs -- Twice!: The Hamish Macbeth series is fun, although the episodes don't follow M.C. Beaton's novels accurately. The Series 1 and Series 3 DVDs that I ordered seem fine, but the Series 2 DVD set was defective -- the first of the two DVDs wouldn't play on several players I tried. Amazon handled the returned item well, and sent a replacement, but that one had exactly the same defect -- the first DVD wouldn't play! So, I sent that one back too and requested (and received) a refund. I went to BBC America Shop and bought ""Hamish Macbeth Series 2"" and it worked just fine. So, I had to pay a higher price for the item from the alternate vendor but at least I finally got a DVD set that worked. As far as the stories, they are well-written and well-acted and I recommend them for fun and enjoyable viewing. The characterizations and plots are different than those in M.C. Beaton's books, though."
0," Rambling, should have been a short story: As described by the editorial review, this is ""physically a narrow book"" akin to a short story. I listed while driving on a long road trip, with nothing else to listen to, so I persisted, thinking the story must get to the point. The exploration of a former highschool athlete who doesn't make the big time could have been well done within the length of a real short story. Instead, very little was dragged out to create a book, that sells on the Grishom name. I've lost faith in what has become the Grishom book mill."
1, GREAT COLLECTION: Very pleased with collection and very nice DVD holder with pictures of the characters and scenes. Very happy with purchase.
0," excellent monitor but not Vista compatible: This monitor delivers excellent, crisp images and text, but Dell has not bothered to create a Windows Vista driver for it, so beware if you have a new PC or will ever have to upgrade to a new PC and hope to keep your old monitor. Dell has had 12 months to create a driver (since Windows Vista was released to manufacturers) and not only have they not done so, they don't state anywhere on their web site if they ever plan to."
1," Great jig saw but it should come with 2 batteries: I found this jig saw to do everything I needed it to, it cuts straight which my bosch doesn't, has all the power to cut through hard maple with ease, blade changes are easy, and it is cordless, no cord to trip on. The only complaint I have is that it comes with only one battery. Dewalt is currenty having a promotion which you get an extra battery but it takes 10 to 12 weeks to get. It is very frustrating waiting for a battery to charge and I really don't want to use my bosch while I wait. I would give it 5 stars if it came with 2 batteries"
1, great bargain for name brand item: Great price for quality name brand. usually you see this price for the low quality off brand that is at the bath shop where I got the candles that us these batteries
0," Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum: I bought this Vacuum cleaner on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is too heavy for my wife to push, and worse, it does not vacuum very well. It has trouble picking up little pieces such as paper or string. When I vacuum the wooden floor in my den, I have to go over the area twice in order for this vacuum cleaner to pick up all of the dust. The clamp that holds the bag is a bit tricky to click open and close. The setting for height for carpet/floors is very difficult to move between settings. it constantly gets stuck and it requirs a lot of force to move the setting. This product is also very noisy. After using this thing for about one year, we're going to buy another brand and put this clunker in a closet or give it away."
1," Amazing Story - Amazing Message: God certainly DOES work in mysterious ways! I was unaware of this author and saw one post from someone on kindle's fb page about Divine... I read a sample and immediately had to have it. The story is heart-wrenching, thought provoking and inspirational. I couldn't put it down! I finished it in 5 days and for a full-time Wife, Mother and Manager of a busy office, I rarely have time to finish the laundry much less read a book! FIVE STARS!"
1, A superb fernch rap band: This has to be the best French rap album I have ever listened to and I review music in a French magazine!
0," ....: To name a few debut albums less successful in sales but with a superior quality to this one: 36 Chambers by Wu Tang, Illmatic by Nas, Doggy Style Snoop Dogg, Dre's solo debut The Chronic, Reasonable Doubt by Jay Z, 2Pacalypse by 2Pac. A few other superior albums: Midnight Marauders by A Tribe, Thug Life Vol1 2Pac, Illadelph Roots, Liquid Swords GZA/Genius, Aquemini Outkast. Do not dirty your hands with this commercial, weak scum: Mainstream and talent are mutually exclusive."
1, it holds wood: The build quality isn't as sturdy and heavy duty as I'd hoped for. The material used is lightweight but it's holding a full stack of wood so I guess it does what it's designed to do. I do like that I can adjust it to whatever length I want. Right now it's just over 5 feet and it's holding fine with the ends leaning out from the weight.
0," Garbage in a nice box: I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who loved the books and movies. Wow, how sad that the HP Franchise let this go to market. Rules were beyond confusing, tiny little pieces a skilled surgeon would have trouble playing with, boring to play since you don't get what you are doing, once you did get a chance to shoot the quaffle, it would careen off the wall under the sofa or down a heating vent to be lost. What a terrible terrible terrible game. It really doesn't deserve even one star on any account. DON'T BUY THIS at any price. [...]The box is nice though."
1, Excellent Rubber Basketball for Outdoor Play: Ball is well constructed and comes well packaged. Seems durable as well. Note that this is a rubber ball and therefore will be rougher on the hands than an indoor leather ball. I'm happy with it.
0," Low Quality!!!: I'm a big fan of Sharp electronics but this one has nothing to do with the rest of their products. Looks good and the features are awesome, but the quality is extremely poor. I personaly have problems with the disc loader: it only plays audio CDs. Most DVDs and all of CDRs result in ""NO DISC"" message. Unlike other people I have not experienced freezing picture or stuterring, but I could only play a few DVDs."
1, review: Good purchase. Was exactly what I anticipated. Worked out great. Thanks for your order and have a nice Thanksgiving. Thanks.
1," It really works!: When I ordered this, I really wasn't too sure if it would do what they said it would but I was pleasantly pleased when it did!"
1," Dallas, the third season: I originally watched this series when it first aired ,however, I found that watching it some 30 years later was like watching it for the first time!All I can say is they do not make a series like this anymore!"
0," Absolutely Horrible!: This was absolute rubbish. The only thing good about this book was when it was over. I didn't know that books that lacked plot and character depth could make it to the best sellers list. If we are lucky, Waller will spare us any more of his so called 'talent'."
1," Excellent Blu-Ray...: .. and excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent film (they said I need a minim of words to submit; what a stupidity! Thus the abondance of ""excellents"", how about that.."
0," Lovely color but wrinkles...: These sheets are just the color I was looking for soft,smokey blue. They are also cool and satiny to the touch, wonderful for summer. HOWEVER, when I washed them the first time using warm water, and low dryer setting they wrinkled unbelievably. And they don't lose the wrinkles when you put them on the bed. The pillowcases are a disaster. I am very disappointed in both of my Pinzon purchases. I have never had a bad Pinzon product before, but I will start looking for another brand for my sheet purchases. I would never put these on a bed for guests!"
0," Haywire: Downloaded this video because I missed it at the show. I'm glad I did not waste my 5.00. It was confusing throughout the whole movie. Yes, there were a lot of action scenes but it appears to me that the main character was always walking somewhere. Like I said the movie was confusing. But when you can't find anything to do outside of the house on a Saturday afternoon this could kill some time."
0," Horrible is a Compliment: This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours!"
1," A universal classic !!: Morris in his book ""The Naked Ape"" has brilliantly portrayedthe reality of the Homo Sapiens specie. He eloquently discussed our origins, sexuality, and connection to the animal kingdom. As much as we would like to believe that we have evolved, ""The Naked Ape"" will bring us back to our reality, limitations and nature. This book belongs in every library of the Homo Sapien kingdom....."
1," Accept This Invitation!: Huth's very satisfying style of writing made this book hard to put down, once I got past the first few pages. I found myself hurrying to get through the day's chores so, like Rachel, I could escape to enjoy this private pleasure. It did take a bit of time to draw me in, but by all means, stick with it. The characters are richly drawn, the dialogue crisp and wry. All in all, a thoroughly good read."
0," Product Activation Sinks NAV2004: New in 2004 for NAV: A Microsoft-like Product activation scheme.The NAV CD informs that you have 15 days to 'activate' the software with Symantec or it will stop working. Lose your docs and no more product on re-install.The Anti-virus remains top, but there are many others 99% as good.This is an unwelcome feature for me and I will be buying another solution next year."
0, Did not work for me: I am a 40 yr old with thinning hair. Used this for 3 months and it did not work for me. I am now back to Rogaine which I stopped using because of price but I guess this is another case of you get what you pay for.
0," Kit's wilderness: This book is is about a boy who moves to Stoneygate, and his life gets turned upsidedown. he is called Kit Watson and the book is an adventure of him trying to settle into his new home.The book starts off with him moving to stoney gate, and him making friends with John Askew who intro-ducses the game of death to him. The game of death is where a group of children spin a knife and who ever it lands on gets to pretend that they are dead, but if you are woken up whilst playing the game you are ment to be the living dead, as Kit Watson finds out. Kit's problems begin to increase when his grampa gets seriously ill, and kit worries about him all the time. Then ghosts from the old mines where kit and his friends play the game of death, come to haunt him. They are children but one called silky looks after kit and his grampa like a gardian. You will have to read the book for your selfs if you want to know what happens."
0," Save Your Money: First thing I have to say is that the system link cable option is awesome, but save your money and don't get this cable.This cable is only an everyday ethernet cable. There is no difference between the two except that one has a package stamped Xbox. Believe me I have tested it and an ethernet cable works, so please save your money and just buy an ethernet cable for half the price."
1," Taking this Train over and over: You can't compare any of the Train CD's to one another because they all have different styles, but yet all are quality music. Calling All Angels, Get To Me, Counting Airplanes are the three best tracks. This is a fun CD that has some catchy lyrics that will stick in your head well after you turn the music off. That makes me know that the time I spent listening to the CD was well worth the time and will be for many years."
1, TDK dvds work great!: These have worked great for me. I have used many of these in the past with no problems And these are working great too.
0," So Bad, You Don't Care How It Ends.: I have to agree that the movie spends too much time being preachy and simplifies things too much. I cannot see how this movie can be so thought provoking as I really cannot identify with any of the characters. Worse than being a preachy movie, it became a bad movie with a bad story about halfway through. If your story is bad, it doesn't matter how dazzling your special effects are and it does not matter how good your cast is. It got to the point where the movie was so bad that I did not care how it ended. The premise of the movie had so much potential but fell flat on its face. It was not uplifting in the slightest. Many reviewers found this movie to be ""thought provoking"" and that is fine. It's good for a person to think once in a while."
0," Incorrect product description - can only charge two AA batteries at a time: I bought this charger for my rechargeable AAA batteries, as the description and technical specifications clearly state:""charger handles 4 AA and 4 AAA batteries simultaneously""and""Charges four AA and AAA batteries at a time""Although this charger can charge four AA batteries at once, it can only charge TWO AAA batteries at the same time; the two center slots accept both AA and AAA but the outside slots accept only AA. And in case anyone thinks I may be a nimrod that doesn't know how to use the device, straight from the product manual itself:""A maximum of 2 AAA batteries can be charged in the center slots only."""
0," Not what I expected...: The beginning of the book was written more like poetry rather than telling an actual story. The sentences were broken up and scattered all over the pages, very inconsistant. It's a little discouraging when you first start to read it and a bit confusing. Towards the middle it began telling more a story rather than poems about how the ""author"" felt which helped you get into the book more. Towards the end I just wanted to hurry up and finish it just to find out the ending without skipping to the end. The story line is good but poorly written, true or not."
0," mostly by Walter Hooper: The main story contains two chapters by Lewis and the rest by Walter Hooper who tried to make a novel out of the two Lewis chapters many years after the death of Lewis. You can really tell the difference between the two authors. Hooper's chapters contain Americanisms, theological statements opposite to that of the beliefs of Lewis, and a writing style emphasizing physical actions and not thought processes.The dead giveaway is that 20% of the novel contains detailed descriptions of apparatus and their use. Lewis hated with a purple peeve such items in literature.Hooper has also rewritten much of the poetry of Lewis to exclude the allusions to classical Greek and Roman literature.For more information read ""Light in the Shadowlands"" and ""The C. S. Lewis Hoax"". Both books are written by a friend of Lewis."
1," Only The Beginning: Clever Lyrics and really fun beats, this album is great if you're looking for music with an edge. Poe's voice is lyrical and poignant. I really love this album...and unlike many ""popular"" artists they only get better from here."
1," best freeriding snowboarding video I have ever seen: if you are into snowboarding and are looking for an extremely high quality package then take the plunge cause this is it.it is simply stunning with tons of the most sick serious mountain descents interspersed with a few really rad trick jumps, but this is really ideally suited to those who want to frighten themselves with scene after scene of sickeningly scary fbig mountain freeriding. the music is way modern and is also superb. my favourite dvd ever! just wow man!"
0," Great if you enjoy lies: Hannity is a moron in the vein of Limbaugh, quite a legacy to follow. This book is great if you enjoy reading about a hypocrite who criticized kosovo but then denigrated anyone who criticized Iraq as anti-american. Another product of Republican party organ Fox News Channel, Hannity is one of the great liars on television today. Lie Sean Lie!"
0," One viewer's opinion: For me, Faulkner's gretest books - his most honestly hopeful, structurally complete, and stylistically genius works - were The Wild Palms, The Unvanquished, The Hamlet, and Go Down, Moses. All of these are ignored by this video. Instead the video (a recycled 80's vaguely European hash) skips from the dreary to the hopeless to the minor; the amount of time spent on the potboiler Sanctuary is one example. I am still waiting for a documentarian who sees the stereoptic whole of Faulkner and celebrates his place in our literature. Do the future of Faulkner study a favor and skip this one, especially if you're a teacher looking for help for your class. You'd be better off feeling your way through with your students than you would be turning to this rubbish for aid."
1," TRIBUTE TO A GREAT SONGWRITING TRIO: This is a splendid assortment of songs by the triumvirate of deSylva, Brown and Henderson, which is set in the late twenties/early thirties, and draws in some lesser-known performances, including Phyllis Dare singing ""It All Depends on You"", Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrel duet on ""If I had a Talking Picture of You"" from the soundtrack of ""Sunny Side Up"", Les Allen & Al Bowlly duetting on ""Never Swat a Fly"" with the Blue Jays, and Gloria Swanson singing ""If You Haven't Got Love"". I must confess that I've never been impressed by Zelma O'Neal's verbal mauling of ""The Varsity Drag"", but that aside it's most enjoyable. It runs for just under an hour, which was par for the course in 1992, but is short measure by today's standards, and hence it just misses a five star rating."
1, Love it!: My Mother has a small home and we purchased this so that she wouldn't have to find somewhere to place a bulky highchair but our son would also recognize dinner time and not get distracted. I love this little chair and actually prefer it over a high chair. It is very easy to set up and it is quite sturdy. Our son is 18 months old and will fit in it for some time. I recommend this to anyone but especially for those who need to save their space.
0," Good, not great. Not worth the price.: I bought this headset in hopes of finding a pair of moderately high-end phones with noise cancelling and a USB connection. Unfortunately, I misread the specs. Although titled ""Sennheiser PC155 Traditional Binaural PC Headset with USB and Noise canceling"" [sic], the microphone -- not the headphones -- is noise cancelling. Beyond that, the phones offer a weak (but very low noise) output. The headset is extremely comfortable, even on big ears like mine, and the microphone works great. Still, for the cost of this item, I'm better off with a good set of traditional 3.5mm headphones and a good mic."
0," Doesn't work: This product is too light to cover any scratches, and it's the one for dark wood . I used it on furniture and on my wood floors and it did nothing. There isn't enough pigment in the product to cover anything."
0," I was hoping for less pop and more fire.: Comparing Garth Brooks to Chris Gaines should be like comparing apples to oranges... but I'm going to do it anyway. A big GB fan, the idea of Garth creating a new persona intrigued me and I purchased the album as soon as it was available. For the most part, I feel the album lacks a certain amount of soul. I guess it could be expected from someone who doesn't really exist. I was hoping for an ""In Pieces"" which kept my heart dancing throughout, but instead found ""Right Now"" wonderful, ""Maybe"" and ""My Love Tells Me So"" good, and the other 10 songs just not striking a resonance with me. I guess I was hoping for a little less pop and a little more fire. Garth may have been keeping one eye on the safety net with this risk, instead of just closing his eyes and letting go."

0," It did not work: Not only did I purchase this battery, i also acquired a battery charger... used it once for about 14 minutes, total failure, so I donated the camera, battery, and charger to a charity... it would cost more to replace, ship, and acquire new product than the thing would have been worth... does anyone need the recording tapes..."
0," A disappointing and far-fetched read.: Tama Janowitz's creation, Pamela Trowel, is one of the most self-defeating and sorry protagonists I've seen. Janowitz piles on the problems for Pamela, but doesn't equip her with the sense or the wit to cope. It's one thing for an unrelenting series of bad things to happen to a character, and quite another when the protagonist does nothing about them, or worse, brings them on herself. For instance, seeing a bad psychiatrist who holds his sessions in a bar is something that should be easily remediable. The point where I decided the book wasn't worth it anymore was where Pamela comes across a severed head in a plastic bag, decides it's one of those fake severed heads from a novelty shop, and merrily takes it to the kid she is sort-of, kind-of kidnapping. Well, oops, it was an actual bloody, messy severed head, and we are supposed to believe that she couldn't tell the difference. No, and if she truly is that ignorant, I have no interest in her story."
0, Blank Disc: I didn't really watch the movie to rate it. I got a blank disc when I put it in the bluray player there was no picture. I checked the HDMMI cable several times to make sure it wasn't that but each time it registered that it was good. Most of the movies I get from Amazon are good but this soured me alittle.
1," A very good and sad book-five stars for its message: Truthfully, I rarely read this book to my son because it makes me so sad and I cry. Although I think it is a must have for a children's library adults will not have an easy time reading this book. My four year old son likes this book and he doesn't process it the same way as I do. He refers to it as, ""the book that makes Mommy sad."" P.S. (I also can barely read the Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein to him for the same exact reasons. Go ahead and buy the book but have a bunch of tissues ready.)"
1," Not there best, but sure as hell not their worst: This is more pop-punk than real ska like Losing Streak. Their are horns, but they aren't as sharp as they were in their previous albums. Overall this albums worth getting, but if you have a choice, get Losing Streak or Pezcore, they've got a lot more ska horns in them. But otherwise get this one, in terms musically, this is one of their best"
0, DON'T ORDER FOR V3c: This does not properly fit a V3c RAZR. I purchased this last week and pieces have already broken off. This will not protect your V3c.
0," Romero: Well the long awaited new installment in George Romero's famous ""Dead"" trilogy is finally here! They tried to update it and I think it fails in many respects. While Dawn of the dead is one of the best horror films ever made and Night of the Living Dead way ahead of its time, here it just seems laughable because it is not scary. It not only compares poorly to other films in the series, but it appears Romero is washed up. If they polled people on what scared them in the year 2010, I bet that ""zombies"" wouldn't be near the top of what scares people. But the wait finally is here, but what a disappointment. Shaun of the Dead was a much better zombie film in many respects. Romero fails to tred any new ground as a director. While zombies were pretty much an American thing, the Italians took to new levels (see Lucdio Fulci, et al). That cycle pretty much ended with Cemetary Man."
1, great book!!!!: I have bought and given away 3 copies of this book. I am reading it for a second time. Sooooo many people could benefit from reading this book
0, Maybe something was lost in the translation.: The movie was brilliant compared to the book. Monosyllabic diction. Forced symbolism. Dull.
0," Not informative: While these authors have examined themes related to Schwarzenegger, potential readers should be aware that this book touches on themes, but is not a detailed or scholarly work. For example, one chapter consists of the authors' dreams about Schwarzenegger over the years."
1, Lovin the bed!!: My son LOVES this bed!!He runs to show everyone who comes over his new big boy bed with The cars characters.It is a very well made bed..I have to go lay with him sometimes and I lay right on the bed with him!!
0," Don't waste you valuable time and money.: Upon recieving this book I read it in approximately 3 hours. Not exactly harecore information. The book is too general. I expected to find some deep insight in to the working mind of a millionare. As well as some valuable info on running a successful business. As a small business owner I wanted more in terms of ""how to"", all that was delievered was basic reasons as to why people that work for others are not ""filthy, stinking rich."" If you are a serious business person, who's time is your most prescious asset, don't waste it on this book. No offence to the author, but in my opion this book is written on a third grade reading level."
0," Too many rip-offs: As noted so many times, but perhaps not adequately emphasized, Paolini has obviously received influences from Tolkein, Eddings, Brooks, and many others; although influenece may be an understatement. This could easily be an uneducated rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. The book reads very much like it, from fantasy languages, to the naming of contrived species, to a hero who seems on the path to ""an epic romance"" with the most beutiful woman in the world (who also happens to be an elf). The epic romance bit is a direct quote from the book and shows clearly the 15-year-old mind behind all this. The only bright side is that in making the main character 15, Paolini has at least created one believable character. While there is definate potential here, Paoplini needs to start writing his own story instead of butchering his predicessors'."
0, Lenmar Rechargeable Batteries: These are the worst MiMH batteries I've ever used. I've tried both the AAs and AAAs. Most stop holding their charge in less than one year.
1," Full of great ideas, but best for coaches of older LL kids: This is a great video, and I found plenty drills that I used with my teams. However, the drills are best suited for older Little Leaguers (11 and 12 years and up). The drills are not well suited for 8 and 9 year olds, who lack the physical and mental maturity (which is the level that I am coaching). However, I was able to adapt some of the drills to the younger players.I'd love to see him make a video for PARENTS to help their kids outside of formal practice time, since time restraints make individual instruction difficult for the coaches during practice."
1, Great Stool for the price: Received the two stools I ordered in less than 2 days time. Simple to put together. Alignment of bolts was a little tricky but assembled both in less than 20 minutes. Got these as a gift for our son and daughter-in-law and they are very study and very attractive.
0, Save your money: You should save your money. You can find a two pack from a different company for less and they are the exact same product.
1," This Books Matters...: Maraniss opens his book with a thought provoking first line (""Everything begins with the body of the father"") and he keeps the story flowing from there. Maraniss follows Lombardi from his youthful desire to be a priest, his high school days and his college football career and on to the pros. The book highlights the grit and determination of a tenacious man driven to succeed. The book is very well written and visually very descriptive. Maraniss tells a terrific story."
1, Best Series Ever: Breaking Bad is one of the best made for tv series I have ever seen. Total exitment............just can`t wait for the next episode..
1, Jane Yolan writes a great book!: I just finished the Devils Advocate and I can not say I have read another historical fiction book that was as engrossing as this was. Jane Yolan takes you into the time warp with her young character Hannah and Chaya. Jane takes this piece of history and writes it in a way that is easily connected with. As a reader you really feel you understand what Chaya goes through in her expierence in the concentration camps. This was a great book. I highly recommend it to anyone intrested in reading about the concentration camps.
0, Works Great-At First!: This is an update to the review written in september 2003.I am the original writer of that review in which I stated this was a good product. It was at first!!!! My son loved the sounds this product had and so did I. It offered so much variety. Well that all changed when the product stopped working correctly. It seemed to be stuck in demo mode.It would play for 30 seconds and shut off.We thought maybe the batteries needed to be replaced so we changed them. Didn't work! We connected the adapter. Didn't work! We also fiddled with the switch to try to be sure it was in regular mode and not demo.Still not working for more than 30 seconds at a time. This would be a great product for everyone if it would work correctly. Maybe we just got a bad one! Be aware though that this may happen again!
0," I hated this movie...: ""Saved!"" was the only movie I *really* wanted to see this summer. It looked funny, and was soppoused to be different from most teen-acted comedies. I even went to see it the night it came out in theaters. After a half an hours time, I knew that it wasn't worth the hype. I wanted badly to leave, but forced myself to keep watching, thinking it *might* get better. It just got worse and worse, and more like a cheesy, everyday teen comedy. The climax even takes place at the big seinor prom. It wasn't funny, either. I don't think I laughed once. The annoying cast of charectors made it all the more worse. Despite my hate of it, I *must* defend it on one point; it's NOT meant to mock Christianity all together. It's meant to mock Chritians who take thier religion out of hand. I noticed that many of the people who have given this a one-star rating all comment on how it makes fun of Christianity, and I want to know; have you ever actually *seen* this movie???"

1, DMSO Nature's Healer: An interesting read.I purchased this when I purchased a bottle of DMSO liquid. I recommend reading this before purchasing or using the liquid as the book describes usage and what to expect from various strength applications etc. I got some useful information from this book.I notice there is another book offered by Amazon about DMSO which may also be helpful prior to using this alternative healing substance.
0, Tomy quality is NOT here!: I gave this toy to my youngest grandchild for Christmas and the wheels do not turn well but just slide on the floor...the rubber pieces between the ducks seem to be warped...very disappointing!
1," Great mattress topper: I really enjoyed this mattress topper. I purchased a king size topper for a queen size bed, and cut the topper to fit my bed, based on other reviews. I was not able to sleep in the bed without my back hurting before I got the topper. The topper eliminated this problem and I was able to sleep through the night without a problem. I would recommend this product to anyone who is uncomfortable in their bed, but does not want to buy a new one."
1," A New Look At The Family: I found this book to be most interesting because it made me think about my own family stories in an entirely new way. Why do we care about certain traits, how we define ourselves, what measures success - the answers are buried in those family stories - the ones we choose to retell, that is. I have used this book in classes, as well as in rethinking my own family. Fun, and thought provoking."
1," Ringing of Truths: I think reviewers give out 5 stars too easily here on Amazon. Let's reserve that for the once a year absolutely incredible book. Having said that, Katie Schneider's ""All We Know of Love"" is a very, very fine book. Not everyone will enjoy it though. If someone is looking for quick diversion from their day, then they will miss the point of this book. This book will not divert you from your life, but take you toward it. If a reader is just looking for something to take up their time as they fly from LA to NY, then they will miss the beauty of this book. However, if you are the type of reader who enjoys looking into the soul of another, exploring the humanity of another, the confusions of love, the fears that artists have, and discovering pieces of yourself right there, then you will enjoy this book very much."
0," Not what we expected: These guitar picks were not at all what we expected. They are rubbery and bend. This makes it hard to use as a guitar pick, especially for a beginer. This may be a specialty item and, if so, the description of the item should indicate this. We expected the picks to be a hard rubber and not so bendable."
1," Call Kitchenaid: Whoa, I'd call Kitchenaid. My sister phoned them about her mixer and she was really happy with how they took care of her situation."
1," Moving, Down to Earth, Humorous: A must-not-miss book; when I turned the last page I regretted there was not more."
0," But where's the rest of it?: This book was on a summer reading list for school, and because I had enjoyed some of Sharon Creech's other books, I gave it a try. I remember waiting a while for things to get moving, but about halfway through I started to become more interested. The plot became more involving, the characters more lifelike. And then it ended. It ended so abruptly, in fact, that I wondered if while they were putting the book together they didn't just run out of ink. This is very disappointing, and even if she did come out with a sequel to resolve some of the many things she left unfinished in this book, I don't believe I'd read it. Ms. Creech, I hate to say it, but you let me down. As far as the two stars go, it's more like 1 1/2. You can consider the extra a pity half-star for the colorful and visually pleasing cover."
0, Bonus Disk is a JOKE!!: I cannot believe somebody had the nerve to put something like this on a DVD and sell it. I'm not talking about Shrek Ever After (which is actually really great) but the Donkey Shrektacular. DO NOT waste your $$.
0," Poor design, unstable, actually makes computer access difficult: I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock. So I settled for this one. That was a big mistake. The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable. The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU. It is really a two person operation. Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer. Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand. I think it is a much better design."
1, Adorable: I remember the smurfs from my youth...:::sigh:::...I don't have any kids in the house so watching this was purely a nostalgic event. The characters were all done very well! And you really can't go wrong with N.P.H!!!
1, Adorable but POOR COMPANY WEBSITE INFO: An adorable costume. Only four stars because company that sells does not provide accurate sizing inormation.
1," Think you're a prophet - read this book!: Jim W. Goll goes into a very deep study of the role and person of the prophet. In many ways this book reads like a text book but don't let that turn you off. I found this book very informative and a great book to read. It is not a fast read. Due to the textbook nature of the book there are chapters and even sections of chapters that you will want/need to chew on a bit and perhaps re-read to get the full value of it.Goll starts with a very brief history of some prophetic movements, moves on to some characteristics of prophetic people and spends the rest of the book giving examples of prophets and how to build the gift that God has placed on the prophetic person. There is a lot of info about the blessings and pitfalls to watch out for.I would recommend this book to every pastor and every person who has ever acted in the prophetic or believes that they have a prophetic gift."
1," Worked as intended: This part installed easy and has been working as intended, Good price and was delivered as expected."
1," a fun read to have at work: I read many of the other reviews and was surprised people didn't like this book more. i enjoyed the satire of the average romance novel. Pity Anna was so wimpy throughout - but no one else who have up with the nonsense surrounding her. I also just watched STILL CRAZY and have been glued to the Ozzy Osbourne show on MTV, so the image of Jett and family just swims right along with that."
1," Unconscious Examinations: This is an easy to read and understand primer of a specific projective test. It provides very good illustrations and explanations of the drawings without giving the idea that one can ""simply cookbook"" the explanations. It is helpful if the reader has some prior knowledge of projective theory and application."
1," Very Versatile Brush: Like all Regal products, very well made. I use this particular brush for Latin feels, as the wood handle sounds great as a cross stick clave' sound. For most other work, I prefer a heavier rubber coated model. Non- retractable means the bristles can become bent over time,but I keep mine in a plastic tube when not in use, but the positive side is they do not, and cannot, rattle. Only complaint is that the handles could be a little thicker,otherwise highly recommended."
1," Perfect for treadmill runners!!: I put this video in for the 30 minutes or so that I run on the treadmill each day and it inspires me to great things! These are not spoiled, pampered over-paid athletes that compete. They are people like all of us and most of them are well into their 40's and above. Their effort is unbeleivable. The video also has great stories, wonderful photography and fantastic quotes about nature and the environment."

0," Mr. Coffee Iced tea replacement pitcher: I love my Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Maker but hate that the unit itself always outlasts the plastic pitchers. This is the third one I have had. It does (so far) seem to be a little better made than the last one but it may still split and crack. The original pitchers from years ago could be put in the top of the dishwasher; not these!! I have read that the change in temperature from hot to cold is what causes a lot of problems but do not understand why the pitchers cannot be made with this in mind. They are also expensive to replace. A few more dollars and you could get an entire new unit. However, the newer ones are shorter and do not hold as much. I like the size and content of the TP3. As of now, I am content with the new pitcher but in a few months I will see just how well it holds up."
1," Amazing: Best mouse I've ever used. If you play RTS than this is the mouse for you, if you're an FPS fan you should obviously pick up the IME 3.0 or Death Adder.Side buttons might be nice to bind inventory items to in Wc3, but I'm so used to the numpad, it doesn't matter much anymore."
1," My son loves this toy!: When I saw there was a Pat Pat Rocket, I put out the word that my son would like this for his first birthday...and I was right!!! Sure, it's a little loud, and sure it's difficult for a smaller child to use, but we have a great time playing with it together!This is a great educational toy, and I recommend it for all Little Einstein fans!!!"
1, Really enjoyable read.: This was a great book to read......I found myself reading it and couldn't put it down. Great for helping to pick out chic clothes that never go out of style and to help you get rid of stuff you don't wear. Would highly recommend since elegance never goes out of style.
0," Not worth the price.: These cards are not terrible. They do have pictures that are bright and easy for children to recognize, but the part that actually shows them how their mouth is supposed to move does not really work that well. Which is fine, my son learns it all better by watching my mouth anyway, but then why spend the extra money on flash cards with the mouth? You can teach your child the mouth movements just as well,( if not better), with a cheaper set of flash cards,( you can even find them at the dollar store). It is just not worth the money to buy these special ones"
1," Vintage Gary: This dvd shows how great Gary Moore really is- this guy just blows!! Makes me want to throw my guitars away, and make coffee tables out of them!! Vintage Gary Moore!!"
0," save yourself the hassle: First one we bought was missing pieces and the second one has a ""hinge"" that is not safe. Buy from another company. Poor instructions and poor quality product."
1," Addicting non-fiction: My mom had this book in the basement, with her hundred other Ann Rule books. After hearing her rave all the time about this author, I decided I'd ignore it. How great can it be if my *mother* likes it?? Boy, was I wrong. I picked it up, ready 20 pages, and couldn't put it down for two days until I was finished. I almost forgot to eat. It's that good."
1, An overlooked benefit: A very practical and simple way to save water and benefit the environment.Hopefully this practice will be widely acceptable in the future.
1," Fun book with meaning: Told in retrospection by John and Lorraine, two friends with potential, the novel is chock full of adventure including such beloved teenage pasttimes as ditching school, driving a car without a drivers license, and avoiding parents. The dynamic between John and Lorraine has just enough romantic tension as to make it a bit of a romance without being too sappy. Through their relationship with the Pigman, John and Lorraine are given a glimpse of the types of problems that accompany adulthood. Namely, issues of guilt and regret, doing the right thing, and learning from your mistakes. This is an adventure story, a romance, and a coming of age book all wrapped in a unique format that really captures the ups and downs teenagers face as the navigate the complexity that exists in the world."
0," Disappointed: Horse Crazy one was a wonderful movie...one of our most favorite...#2 was terrible. A lot of #2 included clips from the first movie, to the point of being almost painful. I think the producers are good people, have great principles, and made an excellent movie the first round, but fell short on the second attempt. I would watch another movie from them, but would hope HC2 was an exception."
0," i did not say i did not like it.i rated it two out of five: it gives a few reminders about things and that is useful to all sitters but either the editor or Suzuki probablyhas not experienced the perfect emptiness of the universe, and so Suzuki would have done better to haveallowed his own experience to be just that"
0," It's in French: ... I understand English quite well (well enough to know to capitalize it) and I also know French. However, just because the title is written in French would in no way make it obvious the book is written in French as well. After all, the Ya-Ya's used French in their conversations throughout Ms. Wells' first 2 Ya-Ya books.It would seem to be a good idea if Amazon and other Web sites would tell the consumers this book is in French."
1," Nice, inexpensive replacement: This is a nice, inexpensive replacement keyboard and mouse set. After a few days to get used to it, I have few complaints. One is that the software supplied does not work with Windows Server 2003. I had to search for an older version (3.1) of Setpoint that is compatible. Another issue is that the keys on the left side of the keyboard click as if they are bottoming out, while the keys on the right are pretty quiet. This was a little annoying at first, but not enough to warrant returning it. Finally, while all the F keys are programmable in ""enhanced"" mode, they've silkscreened some icons onto the first 8, like Word, Excel, print and save. If you reprogram those to suit your needs you have to learn to ignore those graphics. It would be nice if they left off the graphics and included a labeling strip that you could customize for your own set of applications or functions. Otherwise, this is a decent purchase."
1," Interesting: This book is interesting. I enjoyed the models perspective, but the beginning is better than the whole. It need something more in the end."
1, Fresh coffee in 2 minutes: If you never tried a Bunn then you owe it to yourself to try one. Fresh coffee in about 2 minutes. Bunn is used in most commercial outlets that we all know and your coffee maker at work is probably a Bunn as well. My last one gave out after 12 years so this one should last me that long or more. The only way to make your coffee at home.
0," Slow and Ineffecient: I hate this phone. I bought it for its looks but frequently want to throw it accross the room. It is slow - frequently does not take all the numbers you enter unless you press them slowly. I would say that out of every 5 numbers I dial, i have to dial one again. The date resets if it looses power for one second - no backup battery or capacitance to hold a charge. Phonebook sucks. Speakerphone sucks. I hate this phone."
1," ""We love it"": Our 1 year old son got this book as a birthday gift and it was a winner. The colorfull shapes are easy to put in to place and he can associate the shapes and the colors very easilly. It is a great bath toy as well, he loves the fact that we can read a book during his bath time!"
0, Cheap looking: I am pretty happy with this purchase as it was not very expensive. It feels as though it is made of cardboard though instead of a more plastic-like material that would likely hold up in the cold wisconsin weather I want to use it outdoors in. They're being given as a gift so it hasn't been outdoors yet to review how it held up but I have doubts that it will
1, Was a great hit: very sturdy suspenders and definitely a great purchase for the music lover in your family. will keep my eye on this sellers items
1, Love it!: I love this pump! I was planning on getting an electric pump when I went back to work after having my baby but someone gave me this at my baby shower so I decided to try it out. It is wonderful! The first few times I used it were hard for me because I wasn't producing enough milk yet (it was about a week after I had my baby) but I got the hang of it shortly after. I can get about 4-5oz in less than 20 minutes. It's great because I can just pump while watching TV :)
1," Ensemble Story Entertains: This is my first novel of Ms. Lansdowne's, and it has whetted my appetite for more. She has woven a large ensemble cast of characters for her story of adventure, friendship, and romance. Apart from the villain who drives the story, most of the characters change and mature as the result of their experiences.There is a very untypical English equalitarian disregard of class and appearances which, while it suits the storyline, required me to suspend my disbelief in order to fully appreciate the many qualities of this ensemble story. My other difficulty was that in addition to there being a large number of characters to keep up with, some characters were referred to by multiple names. For example Legion was also Joshie, the Earl of Wright, Jocelyn, and Josh. This is a small quibble. I really enjoyed the story."
0," not as advertised: As I received this product from ""Lawn and Patio"", one of the burner legs was sticking 6 inches thru the bottom of the original Bayou Classic box. The solution? Put it into another more flimsy box and ship it. Luckily the product itself is quite sturdy and didn't appear damaged.However, I have realized that the unit did not ship with the 20 psi regulator/hose assy, but 10 psi (55000 btu) which has a different end fitting which means I will have to buy more parts to get what I want. At least another $27. The way Amazon does things it is way less than obvious what to do when something like this happens. Usually a lot of effort to get nowhere.I believe the product itself is probably fine. I suggest buying from another vendor not associated with Amazon."
0," The passionate side of the Irish: This is the only book by Elona Malterre that I have ever read. Just like the comments I read for the Celts, this book is full of unnecessary sex. I have to admit that the entire plot/story and characters are very creative, and the only things that kept me reading. I have to say, if you want the passionate side of the Irish, this book is for you, but if you want a nice quiet reading, turn to another alternative."
0," Booooooring!: Kelly most certainly deserved to win American Idol 2002, but somebody please write her some songs that demonstrate her abilities better than this whitney houston-esque garbage. She proved she's got what it takes on the show (especially with RESPECT), so why are they trying to sell her as the next generic pop vacuum? Please Kelly, I beg you -- don't go there! You've got talent, use it!"
0," NOT for children: We bought this DVD for our kids -- but I'm glad we watched it before showing it to them. The movie is a ""irreverent"" version of the bible story, and the sexual innuendo, not to mention the revealing and suggestive costumes, makes it unsuitable for kids."
0," Code Lyoko... Bad, bad, bad: This has got to be the crappiest show I have ever seen.Down with Anime. Down with poorly drawn characters. Down with crappy shows.BAN THIS SHOW FROM EXISTENCE!"
1," Nostalgic Memories: The best song on this album is ""Fish"" by Throwing Muses, from which the title of this moody, angst-ridden gets its name ""Lonely is as lonely does. Lonely is an eyesore."" I used to listen to this when I was 19,in 1993, wanting to be goth, writing bad poetry, and this seemed like the soundtrack to my life. It's a good mix of dark (Clan of Xymox, Dead can Dance) and light (Throwing Muses, Cocteau Twins)."
0," right vehicle wrong belt: I check with ""does it fit your vehicle"" and it said it did, however the belt was not the same. my jeep has ac and this belt was for a jeep with out ac! i used it anyway because (it fits if you route it not to include the ac pulley) i did not want to do the work again and the old belt was shot.their vehicle ""look up"" it faulty. do better homework!"
1," Henry VIII with notes...: This is, by far, was the best historical fiction book that I have ever read! I read Philippa Gregory books before this book and it was so much fun to tie the entire time period and characters together. If you have ever had any interest in the life of King Henry VIII this book is definitely for you! You won't want it to end even though it is over 900 pages. Buy it!"
0," A little disappointed!!: I was really looking forward to this release because Jeff Pilson is such a great and talented musician. The first time I put it on I was in my car going to work because that is how I rate any new c.d. I purchase. When I heard the opening track ""What cost war"" I was blown away. It sounded alot like a ""Dio"" song, I really like that song. Then I heard ""The night you walked away"" and said to my self this album really rocks. The third song ""Wrong place wrong time"" is o.k. but nothing spectacular. The fourth one ""Playing God again"" is a really cool song but I feel as though the music sounds kind of muddy on that one. ""Solitary world"" is a catchy tune which I happen to really like and then the sixth one ""In the dead of night"" is pretty cool. So far so good, then that's where the bottom totally fell out on the c.d. The next four songs are just brutal. I find myself shutting it off constantly after the sixth song. I still think Pilson is great but I am just disappointed in this c.d."
0," Very Dangerous !!: I purchased this a few months ago and had a terrible experience with it. The shelf the cup sits on is way too small and it makes the cup unstable when in place. I reached for the cup and it tipped over and I had horrible burns on my tummy where the hot coffee hit that took over a month to heal and now I have a nice scar from it. It was the worse burn I have ever had and although I know accidents happen, I am not a careless person at all and I didn't bump the cup hard enough that it would have tumped over.. Also the cup is top heavy because the bottom is so slender which contributed to the accident. It is just a terrible design on this item that makes it very unsafe."
0," Measuring not accurate: Tape measure worked fine, but it started at 0.5-0.75 inches instead of 0, making it hard to measure accurately. Returned it and got my money back."
1," The Fall of the Lakers: This book is Coach Jackson's journal of the last season of the great Lakers dynasty. Here is the behind the scenes look at the power struggle in the real triangle offense - Phil+Shaq+Kobe! What happened, why did these 3 time champs fail with only 3 victories from a another championship? It's all here, the locker room squabbles, the Kobe Trial, Dr. Buss's shallow pockets. It is sad that America loves to tear down their heros but even the curtain must fall on Showtime and this book tells why?"
0," Byron: The Flawed Book: This was one of the first books in a good while that I almost didn't finish. It is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have read in a long time. The style of the writing is cramped, and hard to comprehend at times. I also found it hard to keep track of most of the people in the book. I do have some pity for her, it must be hard to write a biography of such a mean spirited man."
1," Great for Teens: My mom bought me this book because I am pretty unhappy about my weight and she knows that I am always asking this question. I really liked the book but I wish it would have had more stories about teenagers. I know that teens aren't the only ones who ask this question but it is really sad when all the girls my age hate their bodies and don't even focus on school because they all just focus on losing weight and getting the attention of boys. Anyway, I thought this book was written with a friendly tone. And she sounded like she really felt good about her life. I want to feel good about my life too!"
1," Great bed but make sure you check the packaging before you sign for it!!!: This bed arrived on time, was easy to assemble and put the stickers on. The only (and a BIG problem!!) is that we did not receive the correct stickers. We received duplicate sheets of some items and none of the others. Therefore, my son's bed has only one side (the side against the wall unfortunately) which is complete.I contacted dreamtime (the suppliers) who were prompt in their repsonse that it was not their problem and I should contact the manufacturers!!I don't think this is acceptable and am waiting for them to get back to me with a better suggestion!If you do buy this bed, I wouldn't recommend buying it from Dreamtime and I would suggest you check all the packaging before signing for it!"
0," Book should be called Path of Savitir not the Mother: Having seen Amritanandamayi (Ammachi) every year since 1987, I found this book to be disappointing. There is too much me, me, me, I, I, I, in this book. The book is too much about this author's emotional problems and how Ammachi's influence affect her. Why would anyone be interested in this person? She's not famous or anything. If you want to know more about Ammachi and her influence on people in the world I suggest buying the well written book: Amma, Healing the Heart of the World."
1, Santa Claus and his elves: This is my favorite christmas story. I have read it every Christmas for 20 years. The illustrations are wonderful. Everytime you read it you find something new in the pictures.
1," My boyfriend loves it!: I gave it as a gift to my boyfriend, a huge Oingo Boingo fan. He loved it. I'm new to them, and think the band is great (although quite odd, as fans know well)."
0," Not comfortable, not that effective: I bought 3 of these (for my sister, my mom, and for me) & it's so-so. Like someone else reviewed, the most it does is serve as a reminder to keep my back straight, but if I get lazy I can hunch over without this thing providing any support against slouching. I also found the straps uncomfortable in the armpit area. I use it combined with a lower back posture brace (which I absolutely love - the Mueller one on this site), but I could very well do without this one."
0, Material used has changed: I have bought this product for years from Rubbermaid. Can't find in stores anymore. Ordered on line only to find Rubbermaid changed material they used to make it. The suction cups dont hold and mat will not fold down over sink divider. No better than the garbage I found in stores. Dont recommend anyone spend their money on this. Rubbermaid really needs to rethink this one.
1, What do you expect for the price?!?!: I bought this for under $150 on sale. Mine came with a rebate so it was even lower. The speed at which pages come out of the printer make it well worth the price paid. If this thing dies in six months I would have gotten my money's worth and I wouldn't even object to getting another one! I do get some of the curling mentioned but I'm also using a $2 ream of paper. I'm sure with better paper it will be fine. The pages are far from unusable though.
1," Good Calculator: I am happy with this purchase and very happy to once again have a large enough calculator (but not too large) to input numbers easily and with speed. I also am usually never disappointed with Canon products, even my digital camera is a Canon. The keys are easy to strike and it's a lot less noisy than the one I used to use for auditing and there is plenty of functionality for a wide variety of math uses. It seems to be a bit more difficult to figure out how to use this machine to it's full capacity since it doesn't operate in the same way all of the former calculators I've used did, therefore, the 4 stars versus 5, but overall, I'm happy with this purchase."
1," Both CDs were mislabeled: Both CDs are great live recording. Stan Getz Quartet played wonderfully.The Green CD was labeled as Disc Two ""Spring Is Here"", is wrong.It actually should be labeled as CD #1 (The Dolphin) and has 6 tracks on it.Then, the Red CD was labeled as Disc One ""The Dolphin"", is wrong.It should be CD #2 (Spring Is Here) and has 7 tracks on it.This mislabeling incident showed that Sony DADC manufacturedthem without quality control in place, and Concord Jazz -the musiclabel owner- also has no QC. It is annoying."
1," MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS!!: This is BY FAR the BEST TEETHER my daughter has. She LOVES it so much it is usually with her 24/7! However, we got hers at our local CVS Pharmacy for $3.99. I would suggest checking out yours first (if you have them where you live)."
0, VIOLENCE BEYOND!!!: A ton of violence that does nothing to improve the already lame story line of this prequel. I'm amazed that this was authored by McMurtry after comparing it to the TV Lonesome Dove with Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Even the sequal - Return to Lonesome Dove authored by another blows this away with enjoyment and character development. Don't waste your time or money!
0," Poor quality, poor design: I bought these headphones after reading they were good for drummers. I read reviews saying they break easily, but I thought it was probably mistreatment from the owner side. I was wrong! The first time I used them they broke just by taking them off my head. This is poor quality, poor design item. Absolutely NOT recommended."
0," Somewhat insulting to college grad's intelligence: The book does cover all the basics, but it's painfully insulting in parts as it drones on about basics like avoiding passive voice. Didn't I learn this in high school?Ten years ago the books must have been pitched to a higher level."
0," Strange Movie To Understand: I really just can't get into Traffic. The movie seemed to bore me and just could not follow it. Usually I enjoy most of Michael Douglas's films but this one is probably my least favorite of any he has done. I tried watching it a second time and still just kept boring me for some reason. It did remind me of say 'Crash' or 'Pulp Fiction' in how different stories try to interlock but kept getting lost in them. I would have to look back at the 2000 academy award competition since it won a few awards but guess some people found the movie great, I didn'tPeter J. Miller"
1," THAT SNAKE...: This recording is pivotal. It represents the beginning of Nile's ascent to the extreme metal pantheon. An other-worldly, brutal, and cryptic juggernaut of immense proportions. From the initial kick in the teeth that is ""The Blessed Dead"" to the leviathan ""Unas, Slayer of the Gods"" to the insurmountable ending title suite, you will be held under a barrel. This obliterates 99 % of other dinosaur death metal morons (Deicide, anyone?) For the uninitiated, start here. For the haters, go pound sand. For the musically adventurous, what have you got to lose? Get your copy today (I should emphasize that you purchase the physical CD, if only for the exstenively researched liner notes)"
0," Hinges Of Hate??????: What's next, how the Irish built the great wall of China? How anyone with even a 4th grade education could believe that the Greeks and Romans needed others to preserve their ""rich heritage goes beyond all logic and reason."" The 3-5 star reviewers have unintentionally endorsed the bigotry and misinformation that the author spews throughout. How can any reader overlook it? Even some reviewers who share the authors ethnicity have expressed their disgust, like-""I'm Irish."" The author failed to mention that most of the Continental monasteries they founded barely lasted a generation. The locals understandably got fed up with their ""PARASITICALLY LIVING OFF THEM!"" The Benedictines were self suffiecent Mr. Egolf! Where did these saintly{HAH} monks get their books? Other more educated reviewers had to tell us since the author refused too! That in itself made this book stink of Lindberger! I hope Amazon dumps this into their bargain bin."
1," Quick, an easy read.: This a quick and easy read. I recommend it to any fan of history, especially if one's knowledge of the subject comes from time in elementary school."
1," price watching: I'm sorry I missed the $23 price mentioned in other reviews. I have been tracking the price for the last 6 months and it seems to fluctuate between $24.99 and $29.99. If you want to track it yourself, the easiest way is to put it in your shopping cart and move it to the ""save to buy later"" section. Now every time you bring up your shopping cart it will tell you if the price has changed since your last visit--there will be a message at the top of the shopping cart page. If you can get it at $23, more power to you, but my recommendation would be to grab it when it hits $24.99."
0," Great Gadget that does not work under WinNT: The Creative Nomad looks good and feels good. The sleek design, 2x32 MB memory and the FM tuner - the added useful feature - made me go for it. Back home, where I run Windows 95, I'll be able to regularly refresh the Nomad with all of the wonderful music I legally ripped from my own CD's. While travelling, I am confined to a laptop running on NT. Hence, FM tuning is all I get on the Nomad until I get home (I do not really like listening to my own voice). It's not that Creative led me on to believe it worked under NT, but, well, Winamp and all the other run-of-the-mill MP3 players work just fine with NT. As I can rip my favourite songs from my CD's, I just thought I could make my Nomad work. This begs the question whether I should have bought the Rio and have had the benefit of Elena's RioShell....? But that is no credit to Rio. Anybody out there developed a Shell that makes the Nomad work under WinNT?"
1, Excellent Light Weight Tripod: I've had and used this Tripod for nearly 2 years now and absolutely love it. It is the perfect size to fit in my carry on luggage for long trips and nice and light weight for backpacking. I've had absolutely no problems with it and use it quite frequently.
1, Very nice addition to the pocket hole arsenal: This bench clamp's base is made from heavy zinc plated steel. The hefty weight of the base adds to the stability when it is used. The clamp is mounted to the base from the bottom by a large screw. The adjustable is well-made and exert ample pressure to the intersecting two pieces of wood. This clamp works best if mounted to a larger board (MDF would be perfect). The board should be routed with a recess so the base will sit flush with the board surface. Drill a hole at the center so you can have access to the mounting screws after the base is mounted. This Bench Klamp makes drilling pocket holes much easier.
1, Well worth it!: This box set is definately worth the price. It has many extras and is nicely made. This show is amazing. The actors are incredible. It can be very funny at times even inspirirng. I cant get enough of this show. Its perfect being able to watch them all in order or watching a favorite whenever you feel like it. Highly reccomended.
1," Fantastic finish!: Separation of Power is another Vince Flynn book packed with detailed action and character development. The bad guys are really twisted. Unfortunately, each one of Flynn's books have gotten progressively more profain. I know in the real world this exsists but I personally don't care for reading profanity in my own livingroom. What I really enjoyed was the fantastic finish of Separation of Power."
0, Batteries were all dead: I buy my batteries on line to save a little from store bought ones. I tried every battery in the pack and none of them worked. Had to finally go out and buy a working set.
1," Snug as a bug: I held off on putting my very tall 4 year old into a booster because I didn't want to give up the 5 point harness. Finally, after much research we decided on the B500. I like the way it looks and the fit is great. My son fits snuggly into it and I feel he is safer or as safe as being in a 5 point harness. The only reason it didn't give it 5 stars is because his head bobs forward when he falls asleep (I don't think there's anyway around that) and I haven't had it long enough to try and remove and wash the cover."
1," Great way to learn more about your partner: This game was suggested to me by a friend. When it seems that my husband and I haven't done a good job communicating information about our day, I reach for one of these cards to jump start a conversation. The only rule is that we have really think about the question and answer honestly. It almost always springboards into a great conversation."
1," Various textured surfaces--a big hit!: I initially bought this set because I wanted to change out the hanging toys on my daughter's Boppy activity center for variety. She loved these!! They have various rubber surfaces that she liked to chew and touch. Very colorful, encouraged her to grab for them. During teething these are really great--you can put all of these in the top rack of the dishwasher for easy cleaning (even the fish). Great value for the money."
0," Not so amazing compilation: After reading previous reviews, I elected to order this paperback.My anticipation was for a more complete and accurate book than Giuluano's ""Behind Blue Eyes"".I was wrong, as there is little new information and insight into Townshend. What this book does contain are plenty of typos and too much reliance on outside reviews and articles. This is not so much a biography by Wilkerson, as it is of a collection of concert reviews and previously published articles with a large perentage of the material coming from ""The Who Concert File"".In fact, do yourself a favor and save the $34 bucks (expensive for a paperback) and purchase ""The Who Concert File"" or continue to wait for the real thing from Townshend."
1," Does not cause drowsiness: I love reading anything about history, but sometimes those books read more like a how-to manual, than an accounting of history, so I was very glad to find that this book caught my interest & kept it from the beginning. I recently became interested in the Borgia's (yes because of the Showtime series), and this book was a great pick for my first look into the Borgia's famous & infamous deeds."
0," Again the Magic: I have always counted on Lisa Kleypas for an exceptional read. Not so with this long, drawn-out downer. The plot (pretending not to love a man, sending him away for his own good at great sacrifice to yourself, causing him to hate you, go make his forture and come back for revenge) has been done many, many times. Even in Victorian England, is this ever really the only way? And is a young man who is aware that a young woman has loved him all her life, really supposed to fall for this when it comes out of the blue? Finally, the heroine's disfiguring leg burns being the ""conflict"" that nearly keeps these soulmates apart forever, is an insult to the heartbroken hero and the suffering reader.I would not buy this book. I suggest checking it out of the library at the threat of the next big snowstorm."
1," nice, but not durable: my 3 year old loved this toy, but it didn't make it a year. Multiple strings broke, and posed a hazard. We mended it the best we could. Our daughter still loves to play on it even with 3 strings. Doesn't stay in tune, but wasn't expecting it to for the price we paid. We knew we were getting a ""toy"" Very pleased with the cost. Thinking of purchasing another to replace the beat up one."
1," Arrived earlier than expected.: Arrived earlier than expected. It looks good. Thought it would be a bit bigger, but otherwise, it's what I was looking for."
0," Vicky, Vaa-Vaa Voom!: Peters is a master of this type of book. She really is, but this one fails to deliver of that promise. This book introduces us to a very shapely heroine, but still a very smart heroine, as well the supporting cast. The problem with the book lies in the fact that the main character is forced to play second fiddle to a bunch of second-rate talent. This makes for a less than thrilling book. It simply becomes a book that does not have much to offer other than a fairly predictable plot and boring characters. All in all, not one of Peter's best efforts."
1," Bargain of the century: I learned of these stainless steel exhaust tips from VWVortex and thought the price was too good to be true. The comments on the forum were positive so I decided to purchase them. They fit my Passat perfectly and look great. The factory tips are over $100 so at less than $6.00 each, they are an unbelievable bargain."
1," The mean streets of Lego City: This one is pretty simple. It's a set of road plates for the vehicles and buildings in the Lego City collection. They're expensive, but if you have more than a few Lego City vehicles or sets, you pretty much have to get a pack or two. My son is using them with the buildings from theLEGO City Corner (7641)and has theLEGO City Houseattached to the side, and it gives him a lot of play space. I recommend picking up a couple dozen smooth grey 2x4 pieces to use as sidewalks. They look good and help hold the plates together."
1, Super Guitar: Vinnie Vincent could make a guitar poot if he wanted to. He's that good.The folks who say this cd has too much guitar are just wimpy pop metal fans. They need to just go somewhere and listen to a Def Leppard cd I guess. If you like real hard rock this cd is for you.
1," Great Behind the Scenes Writing: If you love ACC basketball and cannot get enough behind the scenes information about the coaches then you'll love this book.Feinstein is amazing in that he has the clout to get into the locker rooms of each of the teams in this conference. Further still, the coaches and players never hold back on their thoughts. So you get one fantastic book, made up of hundreds of interesting basketball stories."
0," If you want to hear Dalida, get another album.: First, you must know (which I didn't when I purchased this item) is that it IS A SOUNDTRACK for a French TV movie about DALIDA. This movie is not available in the U.S. as far as I can find. Most of the music is instrumental, with a few vocals - none, are Dalida.The music is not without merit. It has a very nice ""international/world"" sound. Ezio Bosso and Jean-Marie Senia have put together a very nice CD of mid-century Euro-music with just a twist of mid and far east for flavor. I plan to mix it in with my Cinema Paradiso soundtrack or maybe some Mancini and Mychael Danna soundtrack items.However, for those looking for the vocal styling's of the internationally famous French singer, Dalida, direct yourself elsewhere."
1," My first read by mr.pete: i was weary about this book because i had never read any of his books. But this was a very interesting read, i wish though in the end it would have let u know how the two friends stayed in touch or if they even did. I recommed this book."
0," No thanks.: The GBA version of Namco Museum 50th Anniversary has only 5 games, not 14 -- Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Rally-X is all you get. The other games mentioned in Amazon's description are not present. Wouldn't gripe about that if the games it has were playable, but control is awful. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man require being very precise with up/down/left/right. Dig Dug actually jerks and pauses with the music cutting out during gameplay. Galaga is worth playing, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Also, hitting [select] rotates the graphics 90 degrees for arcade aspect ratio; maybe that's an important feature for some.A better collection for the GBA is the regular Namco Museum (NOT 50th Anniversary). No Rally-X, no Pac-Man, but you get the other three games plus Galaxian (quite good) and Pole Position (quite lame). The version of Ms. Pac-Man has more forgiving control, and its Dig Dug plays great."
0," Beware of driver upgrade cost: I have been a satisfied user of Instant Immersion's Spanish CD-ROMs, so I expected similar satifaction from the Italian version. However, as I started the installation process, I was informed that I would need a new driver (presumably for Windows XP) and was directed to a vendor support website -- where I learned that I would be charged $14.95 for the new driver. I will request a refund from Amazon. It's possible that the software is satisfactory once installed; however, there is no justification for such a problem with CD-ROM drivers."
0," Not official tests = Not official quality: It took me a few days to realize that this doesn't contain any real LSAT tests. After I took the second test and noticed that some of the questions made no sense, I looked up some information on this book. It was then that I learned that the tests in this book were written entirely by Kaplan. Some of the questions are really ludicrous and stupid. I got the official 10 LSATs and those are much better, they actually have a correct logical answer for each question (go figure!). This book screwed me up until I bought the book with the 10 real LSATs. The Kaplan people that wrote the test questions in this book have no business writing standardized tests."
0," Dr. Cutler MINUS 5 STARS (Nice picture, says it all...): I wish there had been an easy way to separate the thougths of the Dalai Lama from the endless platitudes of Dr. Cutler. To think that people actually pay to get advice from Dr. Cutler seems absurd! This book is for the most part filler and inane anecdotes. The only times Dr. Cutler hits the mark is when he points out the stupidity and shamefulness of his own questions. I know 5 year olds with a better insight on life than him."
1," Excellent, but very frustrating Book.: I have enjoyed this book for the past 18 years, and have figured out about three quarters of the full content. But I have been frustrated for the past 18 years, too... I have never been able to go past the 32nd step of the grand piano figure... and I wonder if anybody has ever been able to figure out how to finish the whole model!!! I wish Mr. Lang would demonstrate how he does it himself in one of his videos... and then I would be so much happier!!!"
0, Terrible: Terrible waste of money on this video.I expected it to be a music video not all interview and 2 songs.
0," Skip City: I bought this player because of the built-in speakers (which is a very nice feature). The sound quality is much better than I expected; no complaints there. But this thing skips constantly, even when it's sitting still on a tabletop! It is so completely annoying that I'm now looking for a new player."
1," Simply Beautiful!: This is a much different CD from Lori Carson's other CDs. It shows another side to Carson's music that I was thrilled to hear! The songs' emotional music trigger deep thoughts and speak to your soul... As always, Lori Carson's amazingly beautiful voice and powerful lyrics made songs like ""Hold On To The Sun"" specially great! Another one of my favorites on this album is ""Glimmer"". Finest Thing is a brilliant work of art that keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys good music!"
0," Dysfunctional Direction: When I viewed the opening credits, I noticed that it was sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Tourism and Entertainment. That raised a flag in my mind that something was amiss.This film is about life among street children in Italy. It appeared that the Director was attempting to document life of these children in a gang. But it was so poorly done. There were several scenes that were repeated as if the Director was trying to fill in time. And I thought that nothing could be worse than Genesis Children.Don't waste your money on this movie. If you want to watch a decent film about gang life among children, purchase Pretty Boy."
0, Disappointed - shoe review said it was leather.: I chose this rating because they lied in the review. The only reason I bought the shoe was because the summary said it was leather. It is NOT leather - it is some kind of plastic stuff. I really liked the style and the thick sole but I do not want plastic.
1," recon vest review: I chose this vest because it was lightweight, had plenty of pockets, and was breathable mesh. Am well satisfied with the vest, its' quality and price. My only disappointment is that it is not available in tan/khaki. I would buy a second vest in khaki if offered."
0," Not what I expected....: It says it is 200GB, but no matter what I tried when installing it, I could only get about 130 GB....very disappointing."
1," Canada's National Treasure?: I learned your world's language from Gordon Lightfoot's lyrics. He's Earth's treasure. Buy this CD--there's nothing like it on Alpha Centuri! Signed, Green but not bitter."
1, A must see!: Do yourself and your life a favor...watch this movie a couple of times and really listen to what's being said.
0," A book not worth purchasing: I'm generally very happy with WROX books, but this one fails in a number of categories if you are looking for detailed information about MSMQ.There is very little discussion about MSMQ from a network perspective. It doesn't address how to setup MSMQ in an enterprise environment -- PECs vs. BSC vs. IC, etc. There are lots of code samples, but most of them focus on the non-MSMQ DNA aspects of distributed programming. The example architecture is also simplistic to the point of not being usable in a real environment. A client-VB app running as the interactive user on a destination machine is less than desirable.The authors also missed a number of details -- the error handling isn't even right. In VB, code is not executed past an Err.Raise call.A dissapointing book from an otherwise impressive publisher."
0," LucasFilm's ""Official Response"" is 100% pure BS!: Typical corporate PR bull. Of course their official standpoint on the issue is that the original prints are not available. That way, in a few years, they will ""miraculously"" restore them and release them on whatever consumer format happens to be dominant at the time. Come on, LucasFilm is squeezing every penny they can out of a 30 year franchise. It is SO obvious their marketing BS stinks. I recognized that foul stench!"
1," great: I already knew this was a great cookbook as I had it previously and used it so much that it fell apart and needed to replace it. All of the recipes are error proof. The shipper was great, the book arrived within a couple of days of ordering it and was in great shape. Thanks."
0," Poor Guitar Playing: The guitar playing on this album is very amateur. Lots of string noise as the left hand shifts. An immense amount of extraneous noise from the fingernails on the right hand. A tinny and metallic tone. Poor fingerings, such that notes from the previous chord bleed over. Tempos taken much too slow on various pieces (I've never heard Fur Elise taken at such a snail's pace). Occasionally, the arrangements themselves are very poorly done.If you want to hear real classical guitar music, most or all of the pieces are recorded elsewhere by competent classical guitarists. Check out the albums of Christopher Parkening, David Russell, Manuel Barrueco, or John Williams."
1," odio poner titulos a las reviews: este es el libro que sigue al maravilloso Queremos tanto a Glenda. y comienza con una absolutamente genial carta a Glenda Jackson sobre su libro anterior. de alli en adelante, los laberintos de Cortazar (que muchas veces, en vez de ser con vueltas, son un simple pasillo largo y oscuro) empizan a atraparte. mis favoritos de este libro: Satarsa (un cuento lleno de palindromas), Pesadillas, la ya nombrada carta (Botella al mar). recomendado para amantes del genero y quienes hayn leíd Queremos tanto a Glenda."
0," disappointment, *shaking head*: If they had the 10th anniversary dvd/blu-ray available, this 25th anniversary wouldn't sell at all! The 10th anniversary concert literally had a dream cast. Unfortunately, this one didn't. Lea Salonga was soooo perfect as Eponie 15 years ago. Her replacement in the 25th just couldn't hold up to part. And while I was surprised Nick Jonas had some bit of a voice talent, he just wasn't a trained operatic singer. It was disappointing that he was casted as Marius. Really? Come-on! All in all, I'd much rather listen to my CDs from the 10th than watching this 25th cuz the latter just isn't worth watching :("
1," Great Book: The inklings and pathos of Jim Morrison. I thought. And then I thought - Is this real?? This book is not a biography of sorts or even a collection of Jim Morrison's diaries - It's an excellent exercise in the use of imagination! The many streams of thoughts that go in many directions - something indicative of an artist/musician - puts the reader in a state of mind that creates a multitude of emotion, and desire, and experience. The difuse quality could be viewed in any way, but I see it as the mind of a great musician.. whether it be Jim Morrison or NOT!"
0," Hasbro succeeds in ruining a classic game: I purchased this game with the intent of replacing my very bad shape old version. In the old version of the game you could ""Play the Market."" Don't expect to find it is this version. There is no playing the market. Don't expect to have a ""Day of Reckoning."" This doesn't work as it does in the original. Now you draw cards for careers rather than spinning the wheel.This candy coated, politically correct version of the original made me sick. This was not near as much fun to play as the original. Many aspects of the game have been removed. Keep playing the old version, or buy one at a garage sale. You will have much more fun. I give the old version a five of five.Bottom line, if you liked the original game, don't buy this one, unless you need replacement cars/pegs."
0," Money down the drain...: I found this book extremely hard to understand the author has rushed through everything. Does not explain the code, it's just been printed on the page for you to look at which is just ridiculous. I feel I didn't learn much from the book and had to keep referring to other text books and the internet. Don't recommend it at all.I'd also like to add, I wish I had listened to the above reviewer. I thought I'd still give it a try. I regret this."
0," Less than fluff. Why bother?: I ended up hating myself for sitting through this entire movie instead of turning it off. My expectations were not THAT high, for sure, but it was total mess. Offers a handful of PG-13 soft-core scenes (yes, even on the unrated dvd) designed to titillate teenage boys, but the other 90% of the movie fails to tie them together. Who ever thought characters could be SO unlikable and undeveloped? Seth Bullock's performance as the caricature [person] is easily the best thing about it. That, and seeing Elisha Cuthbert in a role she's more believable in than the counter-terror intelligence analyst on Fox's ""24"". Another great example of Hollywood insulting the audience with underwritten crap."
1," A wonderful read for those of any faith: I think some people wrote their reviews without reading the book. If you judge it by only the chapter titles or the text on the front of the book, you are really missing out. I was required to read this for a college class and I am very glad I got the chance to find this gem. For anyone interested in the life and works of Jesus or just love to read a good book that makes you rethink things, definitely check this one out."
0," Color is fading: Unlike some other reviews, I do think these sheets are soft and comfortable - agree about the wrinkles, though. My problem is that after the first washing with Tide with Downey, there were faded spots on one of the pillowcases -smokey blue turned to a peachy off-white. After the second washing with the same detergent, I saw the same fading on the top sheet near the hem. Anyone else have this problem? How do we let Amazon know? I don't see a customer service button and I don't want to return them."
0," DON'T BUY THIS GAME!: This is by far the worst game I have ever played! I rented it, thinking that it was gonna be so great I would have to buy it later. It was just so boring, the dialogue was not translated well, the story is stupid, the characters are morons, the jokes are awful, and it takes an hour just to get into a battle. Don't get this game!!!..."
0," Worst computer: This the worst and most expensive computer I ever had. Yes it is slick and that is the reason I bought it. But it is slow. It takes 5 minutes (300 seconds not 90) to boot. Everything (Photoshop, Streets and Trips, etc.) is slow and Vista is cumbersome. Get another brand with XP pre-installed, or install XP on the Vaio : http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=117070"
1," Fine but SMALL: Using a tape measure, find the distance around your hand at the widest point. This would be around the thumb joint, with the hand flat on a table. If it's 8.5"" these gloves will barely fit you. Anything more and you won't be able to get them on. I think this is the kind of information that Amazon or Everlast should make clear."
0," please do not waste your money: If you want to know how popular ""Mama"" is with guys, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for any substance, then I suggest you keep looking. I can sum up the book in 3 points for you ladies who might think of buying it:1. Think about your crotch a lot2. Ask for what you want, say thank you when you get it3. Mama Gena wants you to know how successful she is at oozing sex appeal, by smiling prettily at men, while thinking about her crotch.This book is so silly, I was actually wondering if it was a 'spoof' of self-help books."
1," Missed the Queen soundtrack: I'm a big fan of the movies and the TV series, so I found this one entertaining, but were disapointend for not finding the Queen sountrack, I believe they are the soul of the concept of Highlander, anyone knows why isn't here?In the matter of the director, this guy Morahan is one superb music video director, as was Mulchahy, the director of the first 2 movies."
1," European Prehistory (study in archaeology): Required reading for under-grad taking Archaeology as a degree. The companies service as well as the quality of the merchandise was every bit what was promised. If this quality is the standard for this book store, I will order again from this company."
1," Non-Denominational Inspiration!: With The Contemporary Celtic Prayer Book, William John Fitzgerald has accomplished an amazing and sensitive feat of balance: he has created a spiritual celebration that crosses denominational borders. This book is a true celebration of the Celtic spirit, regardless of specific denominational upbringing.There are prayers and inspirations for every occasion, from the every day to life-changing events. I bought this book for the wonderful ""Prayer to the Vibrant Women of Celtic Lore"" - but I quickly fell in love with the rest of it.(excerpted from my review for The Irish News and used with persmission)"
0," Too many typos: I'm surprised that the previous review did not comment on the number of typographical errors; as far as I can see there is only one edition. The typos range from the merely distracting, to places where sentences become gibberish. Based on content, I'd give this at least 4 stars, but I found it too difficult to read. It's a nice complement to *Goedel's Proof* by Nagel and Newman--N & N give a much clearer exposition of Goedel's work, but Hintikka brings up a number of points I have not seen elsewhere (warning: many of the points raised can't be fully understood without referring to other works that treat them in more depth, unless you already have a strong background in mathematical foundations and logic)."
1," a great little machine: I just bought a cuisnart DLC-2011, Prep 11 cup food processor and I love how easy it was to operate and clean. It's perfect for slicing vegetables, even if I'm only cutting one or two vegetables at a time and I especially like the dough attachment for making bread. It is a little heavy to move with its tight grips on the bottom, but the grips hold the machine steady. It's sleak enough to keep on the counter if you have room. I'd probably not buy a processor smaller than 11 cups even for small jobs. The size and power of the machine makes it possible to prepare an entire dessert completely with processing.After reading the other reviews I must say that I'm upset that I paid $165 for the processor when most paid $134 or less. And... I had the exact same problem with packaging. The pusher tube was shrink wrapped so tightly inside the feed tube that I had to send the entire machine back just to get one that was properly wrapped."
1, Fan favorite.: Always great to be able to watch without commercials. The extras were great except for the episode with Ruah and Christiansen doing a commentary which I was surprised at since they were so highly criticized for the job they did on the S2 DVD. Don't bother listening to their commentary.
0," Don't Buy: I wouldn't waste any money on this item. Due to the poor quality, I was unable to complete the job I was doing. All the stone and half the other bits are destroyed. I wouldn't pay more then $5 for this set. The cases and bag is nice and that is about it."
0," sort of works: noisy even when no nearby channels. useless when frequency is occupied by any transmission, however weak. wish i'd kept my packaging, would certainly not recommend."
0, Hard to clean: Had this cage since Dec. 2007. It's VERY hard to clean out. The only plus is that the doors lach good.
0, Horrible Horrible Product: This is the most frustrating product. Save yourself the hassle. I bought two as well. And now working on the third to save it for my autistic son.Gina
0, BORING-DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL: I had to force myself to read this book. I had heard so much about it that I thought it must get better or have a great ending. It never happened. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone
1, One Night Stand: This album is incredible. It really shows how tight a band Goldfinger really is. This was for the most part recorded in one night on a whim after a three hour show. It was the first time most of the band members had seen the charts. Any band that can pump out excellent covers like these on a whim is worth listening to. Nite Klub and Downpressor Man are extremely catchy and Feel Like Making Love is just awsome.
1," Willmaker Plus 2006 Estate Planning Software: My husband has been ill for about a year. Although we have been married for 21 years we had yet to plan our estates. Due to medical bills we could not afford an attorney nor did we want to go through the complex process of having a lawyer prepare our wills. We looked at the services available on-line but were uneasy about using any of them. I went to the Amazon site to see what was available and found the Quicken Willmaker Plus 2006 Estate Planning Software. Quicken is a name we had both trusted for years so we decided to try it. I ordered the software on a Friday and we had it the next Tuesday. By that Friday we each had wills, living wills, power-of-attorney and final wishes completed, signed and notarized. My husband and I recommend this product to everyone who does not have a complex estate to plan for. The software is very comprehensive and easy to use. It takes about an hour to complete the documents."
0," MGM messed it up: I like this movie but unfortunately MGM messed up the aspect ratio of the film. This film was originally 1.37:1 not 1.66:1 as it's presented here. I guess they felt it was necessary to cut the actors' heads off in this print. Perhaps one day they will correct this mistake but for now, stay away from this dvd."
0," Poor quality!: This machine is poor quality and poorly designed. I have it less than three months and the turning agent is much slower than when new and has trouble turning a large bird. In addition, the screw for the part holding the bird to the spit has broken. Do not buy!"
1," Less Organization, but handy: Got this bag because I am crunched on space and weight restrictions flying to Spain this summer. It will serve it's purpose. The inside has no compartments for those of you who like the seperation of church and state so to speak, but it does have a sturdy hanger and side compartments for small objects. The inside is pretty large for good size brushes, bottles and stuff. Will update this review after I actually use it!"
1," Worth Every Penny: In the past I have paid to have my carpets cleaned, but I thought for the price I pay for a professional cleaning I could buy one of these. I am sorry I didn't buy one a long time ago. It does just as good a job and I didn't have to let a stranger into my house or deal with the hassle of making an appointment. I have spent over $300 before to have my whole house cleaned and treated for stains. I spent less than that on this machine and I can clean whenever I want and still have Scotchguard protection by using Bissell's chemicals and the special accessory tools. I think this Protech is a great investment for anyone intersted in keeping their carpets looking like new."
0," I don't get it.: If you like listening to women singers with annoying, little-girl voices, this CD is for you. I bought the CD because I'm an Emmylou Harris fan, and I noticed that, according to Amazon, people who bought some of Harris's CDs also bought Miller's. After listening to Blue Pony, I don't understand why."
0, crap: this products main compartments zipper continuously splits. eventually both zippers broke . i cannot recommend this product at all. i hope this helps u all outUpdate exchanged several emails with adventures bag . They initiated and offered a refund . My opinion of the bag i recieved remains unchanged but their customer service is impressive
0," A Train Derailed: Dream Theater needs to lighten up. The band represents the five best musicians in today's progressive rock field but lyrically and musically this effort has slipped off the tracks.Detractors have long debated that DT's output is musicianship and not music. This CD makes their case. Complex time shifts appear to happen randomly without consequence to the song as a whole.The musical tone of these songs is bleak and joyless with anger and self-pity as the supporting lyrical content. This isn't entertaining, it's oppressive. I'll take another Liquid Tension Experiment release over this threnodic collection."

0," Please NO: Sweet mother of God! Did we not say all that we needed to say(assuming any of it had to be said at all!) in the first one? I mean really, the first one was incredibaly stupid, to put it lightly and this one was even worse. Unless you want your IQ to drop five points, do not watch this..uh..'film'."
1," Brilliant!: This film/musical is a must see! It is visually incredible..I was literally trembling when I left the theater (I have just seen it in New York). It has great romance, drama, comedy and fantastic music! See it with an open mind...modern music in a ""period"" movie may be a bit anachronistic, but this movie grabs you and goes beyond. It was thoroughly enjoyable, unique, and fun!"
0," Italian for Dummies: I expected a brief overview, but there are a lot of holes: the pronunciation is reviewed, and then later on you find extreme differences to these rules with no explanation. The same with personal pronouns, etc.It's better than nothing, but I may end up buying another book in the end."
1," Solid Choice: This is a great watch that gives accurate time every day - looks good and functions flawlessly. After a year in a sometimes dirty, sweaty, physical environment, my Deville looks brand new. The crystal hasn't a scratch. A light soap and water rinse and I'm ready for dinner out with the better half. In terms of appearance and performance the watch is a great value. My other Omega purchased in 1967 (yes, I'm old) still works perfectly but I'm saving it for my grandkids. The difference in the crystals is interesting as this Deville doesnt scratch while the '67 does easily. After 41 years of using/wearing Omega I've learned that it's the world standard"
0," Oh gosh, were back to gay stuff.: This game is really annoying and can remind you of not the cool fantasy with adventure, but the little pink fairy magic that you see in the forest. Gosh, why do people like this game so much?Im not even giving a review, because If you get it, youll cancel the subscription the next month like I did. Look at screenshots and itll tell you.The pictures lie, its a trick, dont listen to them! If you want adventure like that, youll have to be playing till your an old man. Get Final fantasy XI, or Dark age of camelot or something."
0," Unpleasant and Unconvincing: I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to evolutionary ideas but I simply found this book unpleasant and unconvincing. The authors derided many scientists who don't seem to agree with them. That's pretty arrogant since the idea of evolutionary symbiosis seems overstated and many related arguments weak. For example, the authors assert that many terms such as ""group selection"" are pseudoscientific. That's code for ""I don't agree with it"" which only means the authors don't really understand it. Another sentence, for example, refers to a ""student-infested house"". Why pounce on students? Do the authors think that's cute or funny? To assert their own ideas, they also denigrate Darwin and present him as some muddy thinker. Oh please! Even though Acquiring Genomes has a 150 year head-start on Darwin's Origin of the Species, the latter is still a much more convincing read."
1, Beautiful and Wonderful: This is a book I will share as a gift with friends and family who have lost loved ones. Thanks to the real people who have shared such touching and wonderful experiences.

1, Fills the need: Perfect basic watch. For those who simply use a watch to tell them what time it is. No worries about someone mugging you for your watch.
1," Even a Baseball Fan Will: Even a baseball fan , such as myself will love this collection of Poems. I knew Donald Hall from his baseball writings and love of the game. Now as U.S. poet laureate, I had to see more of hime as evidenced by this book. Not a one night read, but a pleasure to pick up and dwell on and savor slowly.Ernie Grassey"
0," OK shampoo and conditioner but no growth: After a bleaching mishap, I lost quite a bit of hair that broke off about 1"" from my roots so needless to say I was in dire need of fast growth. I had already been taking biotin before this so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month. Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root. I don't even think my hair grew the 1/2"" that is ""average"" to most people. Looks to me more like 1/4"" based on the line I see. Very disappointed. The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up but I can't say it helped with hair growth in any way. For the price, I'd prefer to use other brands. I see it works for some. I guess I will keep taking my biotin and hoping for the best."
1," Great product: Works well, seems solid. We bought the 42"" size and it fits in the back of our van with the 3rd row seats folded down. We are currently using a divider since she is only 11 weeks old but feel this will be great when our lab is full grown. Pleased with this purchase!"
1, Great card: Not much you can say about a memory card - except that it works as expected. Olympus cards have always been very reliable. No problems.
1," Best of the Series: This is my all-time favorite fantasy series ever. And this second part is my favorite of the three, if I had to choose. Now that you are introduced to the characters, you become even more attached and the story moves quickly through the ever-more intriuging Inkworld. If you love this book too, I would suggest checking out Cornelia Funke's other books, especially The Thief Lord."

0," acceptable but a wasted oppurtunity: The Dalek Masterplan was a massive 12 part Doctor Who epic that was mostly destroyed by the BBC. Only two episodes survive. It deserves better than this. Not that it is badly written, it is just not particulary well written either. It's like reading about the events surrounding The Dalek's plan to use the Time Destructor to conquer the galaxy as reported by the New York Times. Dry and lifeless. So much more could have been done. See the novels The Power of the Daleks or The Mythmakers as examples. Still, it is the only way to experience the story and the Doctor Who fan(and that is the only one who would ever read it) can bring his or her imagination and knowledge of the show along to spice things up."

0," Review of Maxell V-200 Wet Cleaner: It cleans exceptionally well when it works, but many VCRs simply will not function with this cleaner. I have tried it several times on four (4) different VCRs. Three of them shut down rather quickly (both in 'play' and 'record' mode). Two of the four play better after only minimal use. But I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product. I am afraid many VCRs will not work with this device."
0, Never arrived: This book was ordered 19 february and it is not arrived until now (7 May). I need it for a thesis. A very bad service
1," Worked great!: Makes a bigger-than-individual sized cake. I had no sticking problems (followed tips in the instructions) and cakes came out wonderful. I filled my 1 year old son's bday cake with chopped strawberries, his fave!"
1," If you like 16HP.......: You definitely must have this CD. There is a good assortment of tracks here, and the way they have reworked ""Bad Moon Risin'"" and ""Horsehead"", along with the inclusion of ""South Penn. Waltz"", from the EP really makes it special. The sound quality and performance is superb, and David's voice sounds as pure and powerful as on the studio albums. This album rocks!"
1," The best yet: I really loved this one best of all, and for those of you who are thinking of buying it, I won't ruin the story, but it's the best yet. I heard rumors that B.B. was going to stop writing the series, and when you read this book you'll see why she just can't end it like this...She has to continue on..."
0," Didn't work for me: Maybe it's somewhere in the fine print and I missed it, but this adapter didn't work for our purposes. We were trying to go from the DVI port on a G4 Powerbook to our HDMI projector but the projector would never recognize the signal.As far as the one star rating, Amazon doesn't let you comment unless you rate the product. I don't know if I hate it, and it may work fine for you, it just didn't work for me, for my particular application. For all I know, I'm the only one still using a G4 MacBook...but just in case."
1," Book: GREAT book! Was in amazing condition, some highlight, but very sturdy and not stained or anything bad. It's a great read for people who enjoy an opinion from multiple perspectives."
1," A Hoot!: I've read 4 of the Junie B. Jones series to my 5 year old daughter. She loves them all. She's especially proud that she's listening to a ""chapter book"" that takes more than one night's reading to finish.Of the books we've read so far this one is the funniest. It's just laugh out loud funny, for both kids and adults. I heartily recommend it. Barbara Parks has a wonderful way with children's dialog. It's easy to inflect a 5 year old's enthusiam into her voice as you're reading it but it's never sickly sweet or over precocious. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series just as much as my daughter."
1," For Children??: I don't understand the part that this book is recommended for children. The pages to color are pretty advanced, and probably meant for maybe 15-16 year olds and older. Someone who will take the time to concentrate, and stay in the little, detailed lines. Some of those ""fried Eggs"" can get pretty small. This is NOT a calendar. It is more of a ""seasonal"" book. There are themed pages. Some summer, and some with snow for winter. Leaves falling for fall. No dates, and stuff like that.Just wanted to clarify. Thanks for listening."
1," This strategy is crazy, but it works!: Eye opening experience at the tables. First of all, if you use this strategy many UNINFORMED KNOW IT ALL players will make stupid remarks at you, however, this strategy will make you money no doubt especially if you use the simple counting system."
1, Excellent: When will D Tart publish another book. This was definitely one of the best books I ever read. If you have yet to read it - you are in for a treat
0," I'd give it 0 if I could...: I must say, I was willing to pay this amount because I thought I was getting a better quality item. After a only a few weeks, this bag caved in and my puppy would no longer go into it. I tried several times and ways to fix it, but it would not stay up.I contacted the company and they told me to ""stuff it with wet towels and spray it heavily with starch..."" are they kidding? Then I found a reference to this problem under their web site FAQ's. So, they are knowingly selling a defective item and expecting the customer to then fix it. They never responded to my second email... I could not return it because it had been used.This is a company that does NOT stand behind it's products. I found a much less expensive one at target, and it works much better!Do not waste the extra $ on this item."
0," Two Good Ideas, But That's All: This book offers two ideas that are useful. One, learn how youropponents play and document it. Two, focus while playing poker onyour computer. These points are over-emphasized ad naseum.Essentially this is a collection of ideas that in theory could be usedwhile playing online. It is not a system of good practices based onthe author's actual experience. It cannot be, because too much isimpractical and contradictory.No advice about how to play a hand is given."
1," Good show with potential: I like the fact that in the new season they have made some cast changes, especially with adding Navi Rawat to the main cast is great.Plus this DVD is going to have a Lou Diamond Phillips Commentary making it a Must Buy (this was a really nice thing to do especially considering he only was a guest star)"
0," thank god I checked it out of the library: It amazes me how being related to someone gives you full-fledged access to do things that normal folks would take years of living to acquire. I thought that I would get a really good book but boy was I wrong. My big question is ""Where in the hell was Alice when her daughter needed her?"" I guess she was writing those other whacked out books after Color Purple. This girl has issues that most of my biracial friends never had to deal with..ex: like a mother who was never there. I'm still trying to figure out how she can wax on for endless pages about ""Color War"" at a camp but we have a two paragraph mention that she is now in a relationship with a female. When did this occur?"
1," Increible!!!: Adquirí este software hace apenas 5 días y realmente me encantó.Las imágenes son de gran calidad, y el programa es super facil de usar, a mi hija de 5 años le encanta trabajar conmigo en los diferentes proyectos.Bueno recomiendo este producto a toda persona que sea admiradora de Disney y sus personajes. Lo VAN A ADORAR!!!Todas mis compras de Internet las realizo por Amazon y la verdad que siempre me llegaron los pedidos exactos."
1," Nothing like it and hard to find in stores: Nothing else works and it is difficult to find in stores. Give it a try, like many others I did and will never go back to regular toothpaste."
1," Clear, Concise, Well thought-out.: Chuck's style is clear straightforward and makes logical sense. I'm especially pleased with his ability to take complex economic arguments and make them easy to understand. He gives the reader clarity through the fog of information thrown at us daily. The last two chapters are EXCELLENT and a must read for any retirees."
1," Great Flag: Flag is indeed made in America and certified by the Flag Manufacturers Association of America. Valley Forge Flags is one of the four leading brands certified by the FMAA. The three others are: Annin & Co. , C.F. Flag, and J.C. Schultz Enterprises, Inc. / The Flag Source. The bracket for the flag was also stamped ""Made in the USA"". Flag is double stitched and hangs beautifully."
0, I DIDN'T LIKE IT: I wish I could say that I like this CD. I have listened to it many times and I just find nothing here that makes Reba special. Its just an ordinary country/pop collection.
1," I'm not into Pop....: but Michelle Branch has the talent and voice of a goddess. I love the music this girl performs! Not only does she sing, but she can play the guitar well, too! I bought this album unsure of what to expect and I wasn't disappointed. I'm not really into this type of music or any pop, but she is good! I wouldn't really compare to her anyone as she doesn't sound like today's popstars. She's very good and I recommend her cd."
0, Bad Programming: It worked fine with the Sony TV and DVD. It could not be programmed to work with the Toshiba VCR or the RCA DirectTV satelite receiver. The entire point was to find a remote that would get them all to work. I already have the Sony TV remote that could handle the DVD and TV.Very Disappointing!Their support number just had an automated system which did not address this problem. Most of the options said you need to change batteries or turn on the device.Not helpful at all.
0," Not suitable for every vehicle: Nice sturdy case with many compartments. A bit big for my portable DVD player. Did not fit well against the headrest in my Honda Pilot and the base projected out pretty far. Not a good fit if using infront of a carseat. Therefore, I do not get to use this product for its intended purchase as a portable DVD holder. It sits collecting dust in my garage."
1," Riveting reading: Outstanding dialogue. Very realistic. Joe Benevento captures the hopes, fears, and tensions of working class kids in Queens in the 1970's. A must read for teenagers and adults."
0, Boring: I watched this movie for 20 minutes until I turned it off. It was boring and going nowhere. The characters were uninteresting and the movie took too long to set up. I'm glad I didn't waste money to rent this.
0," Very disappointed: I applied the product to my sealed cherry dining room table as instructed. Whenever I place a hot or cold item on the table (it is a dining room table, after all), even with placemats or other protectants, the finish turns a cloudy white that can only be removed with vigorous scrubbing with a wet cloth so as not to scratch the surface underneath. I am now looking for a way to remove the dull, spotty finish without having to spend hours scrubbing away. I do not recommend this product."
1, Another Lovely Book Fredman: Like the other books written by Thomas fredman this is simple to read very informative and logical. It keeps the reader interested in it with full attention. I think fredman has been too bias towards globalization and didn't look deep enough into the negative effects of the earth going flat.
1," An electrifying book: I bought this book because I was just curious to read something by Grace Livingston Hill's aunt, Isabella Alden. I never dreamed: 1) that her writing is as fresh, timely, and insightful as Mrs. Hill's; 2. that these particular stories would bring just the real-life insights that my family and friends needed in their business life; 3. that multiple impossible situations in several people's lives would have near-miraculous resolutions after people borrowed the book from me and applied its healing insights to their individual crises. Thank you for making this book available again. I'm looking for more by this author. And ordering 12 more copies of this one today, so I can let people ""borrow"" it without worrying about having my own copy!"
0," Not a very thorough conspiracy...: (...)You would think that if the Romans were going to create a new unifying state religion, they would also create overwhelming historical, and governmental documentation testifying to the existence of their new god incarnate. This apparently is the same documentation that the author can't find. Seems like a pretty shabby conspiracy to me. If you can create a book that convinces billions of people to believe a religion, that according to the author isn't based on any fact, I would think that you could forge some historical documents?"
1," Demento Country Western Style: A good way to think of this disc is to think of the kind of songs Dr. Demento would play if he was having a Country Western themed show. What you get is 18 songs, mostly novelty or comedic in nature, performed by by country stars or musical satirists. Some of the songs are funny, some chuckle, but no giant winners on this disc. But then again this collection is form before we had the whole Blue Collar Comedy revival of the last 10 years or so. So if you are looking for some mild Country style humorous songs, then this may be for you. Otherwise you may want to pass."
0," Oops!: OK here's the deal. I bought this movie because I love sci-fi - always have. I expected at least an ""average"" sci-fi adventure out of this but ended up with CHEESE. I'm sorry folks but this is one of the cheesiest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. The acting is just BARELY acceptable, the story is about ten minutes long with about an hour and a half of filler. Seriously, no offense to the actors or the seller on Amazon but WOW, what a belly flop."
0," Horrible: This was the worst movie that I had ever seen. I thought it was a waist of money and time. I did not enjoy any minute of this movie. The movie was really badly made and doesn't have anything remotely good in it. Along side the religious part in the movie did not catch my attention. Thanks.Although the service is always great at Amazon, that is where I get lots of my movies. I would definetly not allow any children under the age of 16 to watch this movie. And I would ban it altogether."
1," Best Sherlock Ever: Of all the Sherlocks, Sherlock: Season One with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is the very best! My husband who has read, re-read and watched the various movies from various actors also says Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding. He is fresh. Jeremy Britt was hard to beat, but Jeremy comes in second. Can't wait till Season 2 is released in the USA."
0, cheesy movie and amateur actors: If you have never seen the movie don't worry you have not missed nothing . But for 5 dollars what do you expect ?
0, Ear Syringe: Found this to be of poor quality and leaks from the back causing water to ever wear but were you want
1, It's worth buying: It's not as good as I thought it would be but it is still a good cd. Our way by CNN and Iman Thug is the best track on here. Prodigy and Nas also did a great job. Straight outta QB is a classic. The rhymes do get a little repetitive at times but it is still a good CD to just relax and listen to
0, They took the on/off switch off: I sent mine back becaue they took the on/off switch off. Why would i want to leave it running all the time? Will last longer if turn it off when not needed.
0, Don't waste you time: Don't even waste your time if your specificly looking for a GLOW in the dark ring. Because this one just doesn't! I was very dissapointed when I received it and found out that it didn't glow in the dark!!!
0," hello, informed consent??: Dr Moriarty was the child's psychologist. He was under 18 when the book was written. So presumably his parents gave consent for her to write this tell-all about his childhood experience and trauma. And she wrote it for her own benefit, clearly, making money from it, getting her name out there from the publication.What does the adult ""Baby Richard"" think of his story being out there in this fashion, written by the woman who said she was there to help him? Does she think he wouldn't care because he was a child?The accuracy and objectivity of this book is suspect, because the author - I believe - did not behave ETHICALLY. Even though she may have behaved within her legal rights."
1, Really comfortable; great sound!: These are the most comfortable buds I've used. And they do a great job of handling ambient noise. Love 'em!
0, S 50 Headaches: I've owned the S 50 for just 1 month and it has to be sent in for warranty work already.Seems the memory is shot according to one of Sirius crackpot tech team. Told it might have taken a powersurge by not turning off the S 50 before turning the car off.I find that extremely hard to believe and a major inconvenience if thats the case. I also bought the home kit which was quite over priced as well.THe main reason I purchased the unit was it's tivo like abilities which cant even be preset so if you want to tape Stern you have to sit there and record every 2 hours.Quality wise I find it not as good as standard fm radio and no where near DVD quality..Thumbs down.. Unfortunately it's the only way to catch Stern..Save your money and buy the cheapest model..
0," A Blatant Commercial for the HepaPro Corporation: If you are impressed by the fact that this protocal is recommeded by Andrew Weil, go read about him some. This protocal may work, but there is no evidence for it. The author presents a book full of statements, unverified case studies, and an unsupported study alleging 75 individuals with no FDA or governmental association for the study. The herbal regimen recommended, using the supplies from the recommended HepaPro corporation costs about [money] per month including discounts, less shipping. After about a year of this, if your Hep C LFTs are normalized, the maintenance regimen is about [money] per month - forever."
0," A travesty of the original: Anyone who saw Nyree Dawn Porter will be repulsed by the horrible casting of Gina McKee as Irene. How could this gawky sourpuss be the woman whose beauty drove Bosinney to his death, Soames to rape, and Jolyon to perfect happiness?Damian Lewis does a good job of chewing curtains. The rest are ok. But the entire cast suffers from having an ugly Irene. It just ain't so, as George would have said!"
0," Boring and Tedious: Boring! Who cares about what happens to Anna Wulf? It's one of those books that when you read them, you KNOW you are reading a book, and you feel annoyed that you are wasting precious time for not reading something else more interesting. I like books that make me forget the time and the world. This is not one of them."
1," It - Just Works: To date, there isn't much to say about this drive other than it hasn't died on me a few weeks in, so it works fine. It's a hard drive - it does it its job. End of story."
1," Another awesome CD! Rich, Dark and Mystical!: A unique and visceral journey into yet another fantastic realm of Nox Arcana. I especially like the ancient and exotic sound of this CD, which elegantly captures the dark mysticsm of Lovecraft. The CD artwork is consistently visually stunning. I love to use the music for dark dancing but it is especially great for an incredibly creepy Halloween!!"
0, Not the Picture I Paid For: I don't know who's responsible for matching the picture with the product but this is not the picture I paid for. I like to collect jigsaw puzzles for my children and the picture has everything to do with my decision to buy it. My son was looking forward to getting the construction puzzle with the blue excavator. Instead we received a cartoon-like picture with a yellow excavator. So it was a great disappointment to receive a different picture than the site page promised. Something needs to be done about this deception.
0," Controls need help: I have consistently purchased EA's NHL games since the debut on Genesis. When the GBC version came out, I had hope that it would translate fairly well. Games on GBC tend to be very simple and easy which leads to plenty of fun. Unfortunately, they tried to do too much for this game. The controls are extremely slow, the gameplay is very choppy (turn offsides off), and there are some unwelcome bugs and chop in the graphics. This game could have been done better for the GBC."
0," This is NOT a kit..: The product description and pictures of a kit are inaccurate. The meter arrived fully assembled, probably in China. This was a disappointment. If I had known it wasn't a kit even though the words and pictures said it was a kit, I wouldn't have purchased it. On the plus side, it does come with a zippered black vinyl case that has room for the test leads and a folded paper manual. Included was a new 9V battery in good condition, and a set of two AA batteries that were leaking electrolyte."
0," What happened to my review?: I read ""Come Near Me"" and was intensely disappointed in the plot and characters. Halfway through the book I couldn't think of a single reason why I should continue through to the finish. I reviewed this book and the review has not been posted. Why?"
1," As Fun As The Original: This edition of Clue contains great grapics, cool jazz music (which they should have on while you play the game as well). The animation flows without any bugs and you can play different levels like easy, medium, hard. Not the best game available so wait until this one is on sale."
0," Not much annoying A&C schtick, but not much to redeem it either...: I bought this expecting (based on reviews) something more...Granted, the usual irritating mannerisms weren't plentiful - but there was still plenty of, ""Why, you..."" and fist shaking.This movie most notably lacked a good script. It took some good ideas (the Jack story is embedded in a modern-day tale of babysitting for a bratty little kid, some potentially charming embellishments on the fairy tale itself), but the writing (this thing must have been churned out in a week or two) didn't do anything with them. The songwriting and choreography are similarly uninspired.The other thing that wasn't there was quality acting/directing (for example, the giant spends most of his time standing around looking threatening).My sons (4 and 5) are big movie fans, and will sit and watch almost anything - they lost interest in this within a few minutes. I made the mistake of continuing to watch, waiting for something good to happen. It never did."
0, Garbage!: I bought this for my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer. The style and craftmanship was as expected. Loading the images was easy. The digital image I loaded was from a 8mp camera but the image displayed was around a 1mp and was very very washed out almost to the point of not being able to see the picture. It would not turn on unless I pluged it into a power outlet even after charging overnight. Overall a dont buy item.
0," Another crump out of warranty: I had the same experience as others here. The drive worked OK but died completely about 15 months out. La Cie claims it's more expensive to fix it than to replace it...so I will replace it, but not with one of theirs."
0, Show Biz Jazz: Not enough practical advice mixed in with the personal stories about his own success. Not a bad read for what it is but not sure it will give you insights as to how to develop your gift.
0," Classic movie - defective release: The version about to be released on 2009-09-01 is defective. Picture quality is from the 2000 DVD master. I would advise waiting until an updated release is made available, don't let them make you pay twice!!"
1, They are higly entertaining: The main reason i bought this was because of the movie usually you read it first and then when a movie of it comes out you watch it anyway the books are very easy reading and entertaining.
0, Poor Longevity: Recharge 1000 times? We have recharged these batteries 50 times at most and then they start to fall of real fast. I was surprised because I really believed they were the best way to go.
0," After spending lots of $$ I give up: I've had two Mosquito magnets, the Liberty and the Liberty Plus. Nether lasted more than 3 seasons, and based on what I read here, I was lucky. After spending major $$ on new net, CO2 cartridges, odor pallets and a new battery ($70 + shipping) I'm done. The customer service representative told me my only option is to send it in and have it replaced for a refurbished one ($280+). Mosquito Deleto and Skeeter Vac retail at about $300, so I'm checking those out next. I must say that both MMs caught tons of mosquitos when they worked. But they where expensive to operate and very unreliable. It's a shame that they solved the hard part, the biology behind catching mosquitoes. Then they fail to engineer a propane gas device with some simple electronics. They've fooled my twice, that's enough."
1," A good idea gone badly wrong: Everyone else has said it for me. I like the graphics, there have been a few clever activities but the jerkiness and poor angles of the camera are very distracting. I'm only halfway through the game and it's lost data while saving at least four times--very frustrating to have to complete a whole level again. It's too easy, which is nice for my three year old. It's too short. In summary, because of the bugs and slapdash attention to programming, this is the most frustrating and annoying game I have ever played."
1, Enjoyed another Scarpetta story: Always one of my favorites! Never fails to hold my interest! I think everyone will like this one by Cornwell.
0," Beyond Tasteless: Many find this film funny, but I found it tasteless, racist, and disgusting. If you enjoy humor that involves drinking from toilets, this is the film for you. If not, run quickly away--far, far away!"
0," Very Dissapointed: I got this as a christmas present. I have been so disspointed with it ever since I first used it. I decided to keep it and give it a try, and have not had any luck since. It leaves streaks of water no matter how many times you go over a spot. Mine will switch the motor automatically to the wet motor and stop sucking while on the vaccum side, over and over again. I was re-reading the directions to see if I was doing anything wrong and read that the cord contains lead. This was disturbing since I have two young childre and they are constantly touching the cords of items like this while I am cleaning. If I would have seen that on the outside of the box I would never have bought it. I am going to return it and get a hoover floormate. All of my hoovers (vaccum and carpet steamer) say nothing about having lead in the cord and all work much better than any bissel I have ever owned."
1, OVA ruins the series....-Jult Warfell: The first half of the season is very educational and entertaining.........the second half of the season was okay I suppose but its worth it to own this series.......... -Jult Warfell
1," Good: I thought this book was pretty good. There was a lot of time covered in such a small book. I think Zane could have expounded on some things and made the book longer. I don't think this book was trash, but it was explicit. It painted a very vivid picture (wouldn't recommend it for teenagers). I read ""Shame On It All"" which was good and I look forward to reading ""The Sex Chronicles"" series and ""Heatseekers."""
0," Can't wait to get rid of it!!!! ZERO STARS: I have struggled with this software for six months, and like many other reviewers, I would like to give this ZERO stars. I have used ACT for over 10 years, and have always been very pleased. This version is a disaster--EXTREMELY slow memory hog, backup and restore is virtually impossible. I am completely frustrated and sorry I ""upgraded"" to this version. We will be converting (at significant expense) to other software as soon as possible. Why couldn't Sage just leave it alone?"
0," Old junk. Never liked Ormandy and his band: This is rushed, out of balance, and um... how shall I put it... well, nicht zusammen, believe it or not. Winds slightly out of tune now and then. This video is from 1977, so the sound is defective as well: trebly and tinny. I'd live with it if the performance were good, but it's quite lousy, actually. The worst performance of both pieces I've ever heard. Give it a pass -- or, if you must hear it, rent before buying: I bet you'll forego the purchase. (PS. Ignore the five-star reviewers here: I suspect at least some of them are hired drones retyping liner notes to attach something to their contractually obligatory five stars.)"
1," This movie is insane!: I really like this movie! It shipped right away and I received it when I was told I would. This movie is really crazy and sometimes I ask myself ""Did that really just happen?"" But I received a brand new copy of this movie and it was in pretty good condition. I've already watched it and there were no problems as far as I am concerned."
1," recommended: i bought this book for my dad he loved this franchise,it came really quick and in perfect state il keep buying the others.i didn't read yet but my dad says it was epic,i willing to read them all"
0," Way Too Contrived: There are some very good things about this film. The acting, for one. The setting, for another. The cinematography, for a third. Maybe the music. But that's it. In all other respects, the movie fails. What, exactly, is it? A comedy? A tragedy? A spoof of gangster films? The jokes about ""in Bruges"" become stale. Fast. The ""midget"" jokes likewise. And, what is most disappointing, is that the plot is soooooooo contrived! Nothing happens as it would: it happens in a way that is convenient for the plot. Characters speak after they should by all accounts be dead (and this happens more than once). Somebody who is running for his life makes his body as large a target as possible for the killer chasing him. Everybody conveniently knows everybody else. Contrived. Unsatisfying."
0, giles provokes no smiles: This is a dreadful mish mash of post modernistic rubbish. Anthony can sing and could do so much better if given the right material. He needs to get someone who can write both lyrics and music. As it is this does nothing to promote English musical talent; which is a shame to have to admit as I am English.

0," This is a toy: The Super Bark Stop is a toy.It is supposed to be used outside, yet it is not waterproof. On opening the package, one of the buttons was broken.I activated the device with the barking dog about 15 feet away. She didn't even take notice.When I tried to return to the seller, I was told they will charge me a percentage because the box was open.I told them that the device was broken and a try, they did not care.I have to go through Amazon to get a full refund (after weeks of waiting)Stay away from this device and stay far away from this seller."
1," MVP Baseball 2004: Overall this game is very good. It makes me laugh to hear people complain about Barry Bonds not in the game and the rosters not completely updated. First off, Bonds won't be in any game because he chooses not to be by not signing with the union and you can always make trades and save the rosters so they are updated.I love the pitching difficulty! It makes it very realistic. The hitting is tough on the upper levels and if you are not patient, you won't get hits.This game is definitely worth buying because the replay value is extremely high and will give you hours of enjoyment, if you are winning, and frustration, if you are losing! EA is definitely head and shoulders above all other sporting game makers out there! Looking forward to NCAA Football this summer! GO BUCKS!"
1, Extremely fast upload speed: This product met all my expectations and more. The fireware reader is necessary though. The reader increases read speed by at least 5 times. Amazing speed with this card.
1," Inexpensive, Good Looking, Fast Install: I was pleased with this reflector set. They are inexpensive and very easy to install. The reflectors are held on with plastic twist on brackets that simply twist into place locking the reflector to the spokes."
0," Dumb: Dumb, stereotypic juvenile humor for adults (or juvenile adults depending upon point-of-view). NOTHING imaginative in the writing, acting or whatever. Overspent valuable time even writing this much. Actually might fit well with Zookeeper."
0," Dangerous Beauty DVD: I have bought Dangerous Beauty before and the quality has always been excellent. This time the product looked as though it had been taped from the original, fuzzy, light in value and not up to Amazons great reputation."
0," Melnor products are worthless: I had to do some serious re-engineering own my worthless Melnor sprinkler. I sent Melnor photos of my fix and never got a reply or thank you from them. So, as far as I am concerned, Melnor sucks."
1, nikon camera filtor: i am very satisfied with the camera lens filtor.it is installed on my nikon d80 slr camera.
0," A COMPLETE waste of money!!!: This product gets one star because it did manage to last one night... On night two, within seconds of plugging it in, the entire wing of our hotel (nice hotel, in Paris) no longer had electricity due to ""a short"". We are still wondering if we caused it trying to plug a clock into the converter. Maybe the timing was just a coincidence. The following morning (power had been restored) I tried to plug in my flattening iron, a spark shot out and then the entire room got that nasty electrical smell.We finally bought a curling iron with European ""parts"", which is pretty expensive given the exchange rate. I returned home without my clock and flattening iron. When I plugged my curling iron in here (the American one) I got to experience the electrical smell all over again. So I've had to replace three small appliances due to one P.O.S. converter.I still don't know what I should have used, but I know what I won't bother with next time."
0, Too hard to read: Kind of a fun story kept me going to the halfway mark. But the syntax and grammar are so awkward and stilted that I gave it up. This book needs a major proofreading and rewrite to make it fluent and readable.
0, Fused Burned: After testing it and attempting to run my xbox 360 that was bought in Asia. Every 5 min it would burn out one of the Fuse... Whats up with that?
1," Lost my breath: I had a fit of laughter like I only had a few times before. For some reason, the part of this movie where Borat confronts the ""Gypsys"" and demands their tears made me laugh so hard I could hardly breath. The rest of the movie is funny in parts. The nude wrestling was was sobering and ruined the mood of the rest of the movie. It lags near the end and gets a little tiresome too."
1," More than enough power to last a day of heavy videotaping: This battery is a necessary piece of the video recorder; though big, it doesn't interfere with operation of the device. I use it at air shows and on vacations when I am having a hard time leaving anything out, and it just keeps running the camera without running out. It charges fairly quickly (I leave it connected overnight, but it's usually ready well before morning). I end up using it, and keeping the original small battery as a backup."
0," Taking it to the repair shop.: At least I got to spray my kitchen and drive gate. I probably have a total of 2 hours on the sprayer. During the cleaning cycle, the sprayer pump decided to stop working. Shortly after, I saw oil dripping form the motor. But I have to say it sprays well when it's working. Thankfully, it is still under warranty (1 year)."
1," At last. A CD with the classics on it!: I've been looking for CDs of musicians that play the old songs. I am a preschool teacher and a mother and would like to continue these traditional songs on to another generation. This is good because its got a lot of songs I recognize. I still don't know where I learned half these songs, but memories cling to schoolrooms. ""Erie Canal,"" ""Hard Times Come Again No more,"" ""Old Folks at Home"" are a bunch of oldies but goodies. I was really looking for Stephen Fosters stuff that was ""tastefully"" done; this comes close. Its done in an accoustical way with the same guy singing EVERY song, that gets a little tiresome, even if it is his CD. But I am pleased with my purchase. There is no jazzed up versions here. I don't know about altered lyrics, either. But I do know its great to listen during my preschool day."
0," Stunningly bad fiction: Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste the space on your Kindle. Really. The story line is horribly repetitive. The protagonist spends most of his time going from Inn to Inn, bargaining for a room and taking baths. Any action or fighting is dry and lacking in imagination. I never did figure out what the actual conflict was. Not only is the protagonist a boring idiot, but really... he gets zapped to a new land and doesn't spend ANY time worrying about those he left on Earth?I am an English teacher. Every year my students write short fiction that is much on par with this novel. Oh- did I mention that I teach 7th grade? Same confusing tense shifts, lack of creative tag lines and descriptors, and so on.I can't even begin to tell you what a waste of time this is. What amazes me is there are actually several more books in this series."
0, Soy Chips: Very tasty but leave a funny taste in your mouth ( an after taste) funny. I would try something different next time.
0," Sizing is WAY off: I ordered a pair of these which arrived today. I have other pairs of Wrangler jeans, and figured the sizing would be the same, boy was I wrong. These jeans arrived today, and compared to my other Wrangler jeans, these are nearly 2 sizes SMALLER in the waist for the SAME SIZE on the tag. I know they are cheap jeans, at only $17, but, they should size the same as all of the other pairs I've bought. Needless to say, I will not be buying another pair of these worthless jeans ever again."
1," Would have given it 5 stars if it arrived with mounting screws: Purchased this mailbox for installation on a brick victorian and like the mailbox. Seems sturdy, arrived with plastic on the top and outside to protect the stainless steel finish and the mailbox is made in the U.S.A. (which was a requirement). The mailbox does not come with mounting screws which I would characterize as an ""incomplete"" purchase. Sort of like selling toys without batteries - had to go out to local hardware store and purchase 4 masonry screws before being able to use it. Called the vendor to suggest that they include mounting hardware as many other vendors do with their products and she wasn't getting the message; needed to be explicit about sharing that feedback with management. Maybe in future offerings..."
0," Disappointing. Poor effort. Why was this book written?: Imperial Earth seems like a book written to fulfill a contractual obligation. As I read this book I kept getting the feeling that Clarke had collected various notes he had written for ideas and tried to make a book out of them without much further effort. This is a very shallow book. Characters were poorly developed, and the story meandered with no purpose. At the end of the book I wondered why Clarke had introduced many (most?) of the characters and settings.Imperial Earth includes descriptions of Titan, where people live mostly underground but can go on the surface with oxygen and a thin thermosuit. The trip to Earth wasn't especially interesting. Descriptions of future Earth were given little historical background. Cultural changes were simply stated rather than explained.Way too many blanks were left for the reader to fill in. You might as well write your own book instead."
1, Plot and Prose: Fantastic writing. Love the gloomy setting contrasted to the islands. Characters are fascinating and intricate. The abandon/chase plot demands a better resolution.
0," Sizes run small: The sizes to this longline bra run so small and inconsistent, I could not find one that fit properly. I have tried other bras by this company and the sizing was inconsistent."
1," Luciano- New Day: For all devouted Reggae Music lovers, this CD will invoke the deepest emotions from your soul with its spiritual messages.His voice is sweeter to the ears than that of the nightingale;his potent messages resonate in the mind continuosly. This has undoubtedly placed Luciano atop my favorite Reggae artists. The opening track ""no night in zion"" is a must-hear for every Rasta - It sounds perfectly to be adopted as Rastafarian Anthem."
1," A Tale of Duty and Desire: This was the first book I have read by Brenda Joyce and I enjoyed it. The first half of the book is far better than the last part. But, it was an enjoyable read all together. Yes, I recommend it."

0," humor me.: OH MY GOD YOU PPL! rob zombie ranks 4.5 stars? i dont see how that can happen -- this cd is totally hollow, has bad music, the lyrics are the worst ive ever heard on ANY cd -- ""dead i am the one, exterminating son | slippin thru the trees, strangling to breeze | dead i am the sky, watchin angels cry | while they slowly turn, conquering the worm""? thats not even the worst , just check out demonoid phenomenon or superbeast. ugh. beg you dont waste ur money on this freakshow. rob zombie's a joke. a bad joke. im outta here."
1," An all-encompassing religious thought piece: This book, while being an entertaining read, was also something more - a thought piece on the viability of some existence outside the conventional wisdom which exists in human religion to date. The question of which group of believers is right is presented in an insightful and thought provoking way - in the spirit of Mark Twain's Letters from the Earth. If you like to think about existential matters, and can put your beliefs to the test, this is the book for you!"
0," Garbage: This a poor attempt at writing. The history is accurate but the writing is under developed. Unexciting, uncreative, and unskilled. Two thumbs down Rinderle."
1," Christian Lindberg Rules The Trombone: After listening to ""The Virtuoso Trombone,"" also by Christian Lindberg, and playing ""Air"" by Bach (track 8) as a solo, I bought this CD. As a trombonist, I can tell how great Christian Lindberg really is. But even my friends who hear his work are amazed at his talents. My favorite on this CD is ""Overture to The Barber of Seville,"" but I honestly listen to all of the songs on the album and enjoy them all. Even a casual listener of classical music would love this CD and I hightly recommend it."
0," The American Saddlebred Horse: I found this book to be informative in a brief way,however for a hard back book that measures 8.75"" tall by 6.5"" wide with only 48 pages it can't justify the price... As I wrote it is an informative book but not for that price."
0," What in God's Green Earth Were They Thinking: This movie gets one star because it has Tom in it. Not worth the time it takes you to press play. Theres only one question here. ""How much are you willing to pay me to see this movie?""."

0," Skip this movie.: Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent."
0," Died after 6 months!: My dad got this as a Christmas present from work and promptly gave it to me. I loved that it was easy to plug in my iPod and iPhone even with thick cases on them. Did well with filling my first floor full of music. Then one day it got staticy and then next day didn't even turn on. Even if it's cheap, I don't want to be replacing my mp3 players twice a year!"
0, The only redeeming quantity are the nude scenes: There is an opening shower scene with one lover. And a closing bathtub scene with a third lover. The middle lover didn't get a nude scene. The nude scenes are the highlight (the only highlight) of this movie. The cinematography is good so a star for that and another for the leading lady's charms. You have to wonder if they made up the script as they went along. It is worse than mundane. I cannot believe anyone talking like these people do. I cannot believe these people work at a television show. There are scenes where she makes faces at a bus stop. I don't know why she dumped the shower guy. But the bathtub guy playing a horn along with nude Hannah playing her horn was worth the $1.17 I paid for a used copy. But don't waste your life watching the middle of this. How did it ever get into blockbuster?
0, Worst travel book I have ever purchased: This book looks great but is actually just a listing of hotels and wineries that belong to a trade association. I looked for the names of 10 wineries and 5 top restaurants that my wine merchant told me to visit. Not one of them is listed. The ones that are listed are very small and most of them don't even export their wines to the US. No thanks!!
0," Sterling Silver Chain: I really liked it when I received it. However, after wearing it for a few days, the part of the chain that was closest to my neck discolored. I have never experienced that with other silver chains. I had diffulculty cleaning it with silver polish and that area is nowhere as shiny as the rest of the chain. I would not purchase this again."
0," Be afraid, be VERY afraid........: ...of the crappy screenplay, mediocre acting, and less than thrilling pacing. Thing is, it could have been a pretty decent flick if they'd paid attention to the details. Anyway, the music was well done and matched the melancholy autumn landscape perfectly, the only reason I gave it any stars."
0, Horrible thin diaper leaving my 14 month SOAKED THROUGH: We have been purchasing Pampers Baby Dry through Amazon Prime Subscribe and Save. This last shipment of diapers were horrible. Pampers has lost our business. The diapers were paper thin and my 14 month old boy kept waking up soaked through. Leaving the bed soaking wet. Something is horribly wrong with these diapers. We will be changing to another brand ASAP.
1," The Coctails of the Ritz Paris book review: As a former bartender at a private country club, I can fully appreciate Mr. Field's work and position at the Ritz Paris. His book is a vey informative and enjoyable read. I had the pleasure to live at the Ritz for two weeks in 1981 after graduation from college, and look forward to visiting again soon to see the completed renovations that were in progress when I was there. The book sure makes me yearn to return to the Ritz as soon as I can. When I do, I will be sure to drop by the bar to say ""hello"" to a very accomplished barman!"
1," Need a strategy to get into top MBA program?: This book is by far the most detail and comprehensive assistant a top MBA applicant can dream about. After thoroughly examed this book, I have the ability to draw my personal niches together, with courage and confidence for schools such as Harvard, Wharton, Stanford, and UCLA. Good Luck for your application process."
0," Not up to par, and small: My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price. I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on. I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem."
0," not very good.: Hmm! Looks like whoever was writing the code for this page forgot to add the tag to end the italics after ""IP""! I'd do it here, but I know HTML doesn't show up in these reviews, so I guess I'll have to resign myself to it. Anyway, this really isn't a very good book. I mean, it has some good information, but it is kinda smug. I also really, really hate the intelligence-insulting ""translations"" of British phrases. Hello! Even if, unlike me, you're not a devoted anglophile, these should not give you to much trouble. Gah...One specific thing that bothered me was John Inman's disingenuous claims that his character wasn't meant to be gay. I mean really. Even if there weren't numerous blindingly obvious admonitions to such in many, many episodes, that woudl just be completely untrue. Come on, people. What is this, retrospective homophobia? Get real. Um...that's all."
1," Great value on the latest tech: At 500GB this is a reasonably large capacity drive by today's standards, yet very low-priced, about 10 cents/GB including shipping. Though they're always 500GB with a 16MB cache there have been several generations of the WD5000AAKS originally with more platters. Recently the WD5000AAKS drives I've received are single-platter which lowers the weight, noise, heat and power consumption slightly. Sustained sequential read throughput now seems to be upwards of 120MB/sec (maybe 10-15% higher than the last two-platter version) and is basically the same as the Caviar Black WD5001AALS 500GB drive. As it should though, the Caviar Black outperforms the Blue on random access. These are so cheap now that it's easy to justify running extra drives so that you have a backup."
0," Watch the real ""Antigoni"" (1961) Irene Papas: As with many experiments in extracting classics and trying to adapt them to modern day you lose everything but the words and in this case those also. This was a horrible attempt to portray the story that has no relevance in the context of modern architecture and tuxedo. There is a lot more Jean Anouilh and very little Sophocles.If I did not know better I would say this is a project for out of work actors. I did notice that Geneviève Bujold would probably make a good Ophélie in a classic Hamlet. Not much good could be said from the half hearted narration it just goes down hill.It takes a while to get the bad taste out of your mouth. Clear your pallet with the Greek version that is much better portrayed by Irene Papas. Irene also did a superb port rail of ""Elektra"" (1961).Antigone"
0, Same video as TAEBO II advanced - Just new name: I was very unhappy when I put this video on thinking I was getting an ultimate lower body workout to find it was the same video I have already just a new package and different name - Now I have to pay to ship it back - Costing me more money because I already have the video! Maybe next time they will creata NEW video rather than repackaging it!
0, Muddle headed: I had heard good things about this author and was very diappointed. Mr. Grant makes many claims in this book and adduces little evidence. His approach to Magick demonstrates a lack of discipline. There is no development of theme. The olther reviewer said this book read like a math text. I must respectfully disagree. Math books develope their arguments rigorously. Mr. Grant is as unrigorous as most guests on Art Bell.
0, looks good: the box looks great but everything isnt what it appears to be.I thought it was poorly put together and was pretty watered down
0," These pillows are junk: I just received the pillows and I'm shipping them back. They are junk. They look like they will fall apart in a matter of days, the stuffing is very poor and bulky. I do not recommend anyone purchasing these pillows."
0," This product is no longer valid!: Don't be misled - this circa 1993 product is a worthwhile review of science reasoning, but it doesn't cover the latest exams. Instead, see the 2004 version."
0," Its okay.: I LOVE Final Fantasy 8. Its a great game. The stratagy guide was great while the first time playing the game. Although some things were confusing, I didn't really think about it. Later I noticed the millions of typos and missleading information. It seems to me, the people who wanted this book out, didn't care if it wasn't done. When it comes to important items (like the Moon Stone, which I still haven't found for Irvine's best weapon) you haven't a clue where to get them. And basic informaiton (like, who is Zell's GF) you never can find out in the book. I still use the book every time I play FF8, but I have also replaced all the wrong information I've found within the book with the correct ones. This book was very helpful, and I liked having the pictures of the game, where I could see if I was doing things correctly. This book would have been better if the editor had payed more attention to his job!"
0," Pilot point? Not sure where it would be useful.: I was looking for a set of drill bits in the 5/8 - 1/2 inch category, and I happened to see this dewalt set at home depot. I got it thinking its dewalt, its got to be good. Well, maye Im using it for the wrong purpose, but when I drill holes in soft wood like pine, it rips up the wood at the top pretty bad. My old B&D twist drill bits do a cleaner job. Guess I should have done my research before buying this set."
1," soft, cushy: My 16 mo is underweight for her age >1st percentile, however, the seat still fit her bottom well. I had also ordered the Kalencom pottette but she slid through that one and we had to return it. I thought that we would use the potty in addition to the seat, however, I have never had to use the potty. The step stool is odd shaped (potty-shaped) and cannot fit snugly by an adult potty seat or sink. I havent been able to use it as a secure step-stool for this reason. The potty seat in itself is cushy and comfortable for my baby and she seems to like it."
0," Kills your virtual memory! C_dilla on turbo Tax: I have a dual 1 gig processor system. When I loaded TurboTax on the system, my system started having problems with virtual memory, and I have 1 gig of Ram. I found out a program that turbo tax hides on your drive called C_dilla was using up all my system resources. Do not try to remove it, this C-dilla program writes itself to the master boot record and even after you unistall turbo tax and try to do a manual removal of its components in the registry, the mbr tries to find it and your system crashes. this software is not worth the hassle."

0," Summary in three words:""Avoid this book""!: I am a big fan of Lara Croft, and try to get everything that has to do with her, most of 'em are good. BUT this book under review ""Lara's Book"" I hate!This book is not worth the paper that it is written on! The guides are inaccurate and confusing to read -- if you want a good walkthrough get ""The Tomb Raider Official Strategy Guides"" by Zach Meston, which are put out by Dimension Publications.The pictures (the only worthwhile thing about the book) can be found in other sources -- calenders, websites and so on.Finally the story . . . put me to sleep. Good night, ZZZZZZZ!"
0, Sad in my kitchen: I received this TV as a Christmas gift and the screen went completely blank just after the warrenty ended and of course Polaroid would do nothing for us. I would not recommend this TV. Plus you had a stand directly in front of it to see the image on the screen clearly. Too much money for such poor quality!!!!!!!!!!!!
1," Wonderful.....: Just as I expected this product is wonderful. Flavorful and fresh. I use them crunched up in breakfast bars to add some flavor, crunch and protein. Great snack, too, or great on a salad. Give them a try. :)"
1," Terrific bang for the buck: I've had mine for a few days now, and have worn them at work almost constantly, and these are terrific. They're really comfortable and don't slip at all. I was using some earphones that sit in the ear canal, and I'd have to adjust them every 10-20 minutes because they'd shift around. These don't have the same kind of seal inside the ear, so they don't produce the same level of bass, but the audio quality is very high. With the in-ear buds, it sounded like the music was originating from the center of my head between my ears, which is pretty awesome. With these, it feels more like the sound originates around the top of my brain, which is still quite pleasant. I can't comment on their durability yet, but they're Sonys, so I expect they'll last awhile. For the price, there's really no competition."
0, This is the worst unit I have ever seen: I went looking for a travel system when I was pregnant. This was my first child so I wasn't completely sure what to look for. I went to the store and I played with several strollers. I liked how this one released in the front. I liked that it wasn't all dark blue since I didn't know what I was having. I liked how the car seat connected to the stroller. I loved the handles and how easy they were to hold. I loved the one hand stearing on the stroller. Then I had my daughter and I went to put her in the car seat. She wasn't a big baby she was 7lbs 4 ounces when we left the hospital and the straps already felt too small. I had to push and tug to get it to snap. It was horrible. She is now 7 weeks old and I can't use it because I can't buckle her in without pushing on her stomach hard. Babies R Us was wonderful and they allowed me to return it. I will never buy anything from Baby Trend again. I called them first and their customer service was horrible.
1," Color is cool: Most people will tell you that the nintendo 64 is a much better console to play than the gameboy color, But they have entirely different styles. I am sick of seeing a new game on the 64 and seeing it in that 1st person type of view which has proven quite popular since mario 64 was introduced. Now suddenly every game has moulded in that type of format when it is not always the best option. The gameboy color however, has kept that lovable format of games with the side scrolling screen such as double dragon. This is a favourite of gamers and is being sufficated by games like :- Mario 64, Banjo Kazooi, James bond golden eye, Spyro, Asterix, Doom, Spyro 2, Zelda, and many more. Yes the 64 has better graphics, but the gameplay is not always as good as the gameboy color!"
1, great for boots: great little product but i suggest you glue some leather to the area that grabs the boots to prevent any possible scuffing
1," Don't miss this important book!: It takes an astute social commentator like Pamela Paul to take a deeper look at what's going on in popular culture. Paul has a way of recognizing and delving deeper into what's in front of our noses. Just as she observed and analyzed the phenomenon of Starter Marriage, she observes and analyzes Internet pornography and its effect on our lives. Yes, pornography has always been around, but never as easily accessible as on the Internet. She opened my eyes to the pervasiveness of it in so many lives-at home and at work. While her disapproval is clear, it's not from a doctrinaire or religious position, but from a perspective of how it interferes with other aspects of life-childhood, family,partners, work, recreation.I grew up hearing and seeing much about how television had changed the world and contributed to personal and familial isolation. This book shows how the Internet, and particularly, pornography on the Internet, has taken all that a giant step further."
1," Getting your act together: This is a well written book that sets out the mechanics of and the philosophy behind a system for organizing all of the stuff that one has on the lists to do. The concepts themselves are interesting and useful individually. GTD (Getting Things Don) is a popular topic on the blogs these days, too."
0," not the best form of B-12: I bought these when I ran out of my other brand of B-12. This B-12 is in the form on cyno cobalamin, which is not easily utilized by the body. The better form is methyl cobalamin. They are sub lingual, which is good and the taste is ok. If they work for you great, but I'll stick with the other form."

1," Good Movie, but not for that money!!!: I own the VHS Copie of this Movie, and I must say it is a classic. I'm very disappointed to see that people are trying to sell this movie for as much as $158.00. I think that's a little outragious and no wonder why people go out and download these movies illegally. I'd probably do the same. Also when you want to put that $ sign down at a reasonable price, then you might get a sale. Untill then, I won't Pay that much for a dvd. Period!!"
0," NOT Dishwasher Safe: According to the product description, this item is dishwasher safe. I found it exceedingly difficult to even get the decanter into our dishwasher in a position where water would spray into the opening. Then, after the first washing, there was a chip on the spout. Overall, this decanter is not as durable as I would have expected. The thin glass on the spout is a chip just waiting to happen. I didn't keep this item. I returned it to Amazon."
1," The excellent Big Blue: Thank you for the timely delivery, the VHS version, and simply having one available. I have been wanting to own a copy of ""The Big Blue"" in its original format and story for sometime now, and there you were. It is in excellent condition and all that you said it would be. I will recommend your business to others."
1," Good for the price: The knife was a little awkward at first and even hurt my hand, that was because of the safety pin (small piece of plastic). So I took a pair of pliers and ripped that off. Now I can hold the know comfortably and cut. I understand the safety risk and only do this if you do as well."

1," Schoolhouse Rock! (Special 30th Anniversary Edition): I am so happy that you have this product for purchase. My children are now adults but grew up on ""Schoolhouse Rock"". I thought it would be wonderful for my grandchildren to have this product, but never imagined that I would have found it or it was still available. While looking over the products at Amazon.com on-line, there it was. My grandchildren also love to read, so purchases from you will be many. I love your on-line site and the many products you make available to your customers at prices that are affordable. The way the economy has taken a turn for the worse, your prices and the many sales you have are a blessing to many. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
0," Disappointing: I was looking for patterns and was very disappointed! The picture on the cover of the book illustrates more animals than there are patterns or instructions for in the book. There is no pattern for the Ark. His carving style is not what I was looking for or wanted, but I was not able to clearly discern his style from the cover illustration. His carving of Mrs. Noah is a caricature, and his carving of the animals is rustic. I will not use the books myself but may donate them to our carving club's library for use by beginning carvers. If the publisher had allowed the ""Look Inside"" function, I would not have purchased the book."
0," disappointed: I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old.Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. (""There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart"" and ""Pig on Her Head""). I really didn't like ""I'm a Mess"" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent."
0," Coby fm transmitter: Great price...but that's the only reason i gave it 2 stars. i have to almost tape the thing to my car radio to be close enough for a good transmission. Other reviews seemed to have better results with this, i did not."
1, 2 the 12 year old reader: I read this book twice and i know for a fact that John Reid is NOT african American and Jemima is NOT a full Indian...her grandfather married a Native American and had Mr.Emerson as well as Canoe...but also her mother is not Indian...plus in the book they do not refer to Jem and her family as Indians...also Lucy ((the maid)) is not John Reids sister. She is a African Slave...she and Cornelius the 2 are married...other than that you basicly got it all right except Dan ((the older brother)) does not marry in the story. He states that he will wait until he is discharged from the Continental Army...well not to be rude or anything
0," Disappointing: I typically love Jimmy Stewart movies. I think he was such a talented actor and had many good roles througout his career. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. This movie is extremely boring. I stuck with it too the end, just hoping that it would get better, but it did not. It was very long and laborous! I am glad that I did not purchase this one, but, instead, just watched it on cable."
1," USB 2.0 2.5"" IDE Drive Enclosure - Blue, WORKS GREAT!: The drive case is slim, light, fits in your shirt pocket and fits the 2.5"" drive perfectly. Don't worry about heat buildup unless you have an older USB1.1 port and are accessing the drive constantly over a long period of time. The inside of a laptop gets much warmer than this external case does. I don't swap drives since this case is so cheap I bought 3 of them for extra drives. I don't know how durable it would be to pull the connector off the hard drive if you swapped drives over and over but that seems silly to me anyway! The unit was totally plug and play on my Win XP system, no drivers or installation needed. It comes with a USB cable and drivers for older Win98/SE systems. I highly recommend this case for a backup drive.HW"
1," Nice book!: I enjoyed this book, overall i think the book is more of a basic intro to cosmology and astrophysics as I am sort of familiar with the material presented, but i still learned and picked up alot of information in the book. I found the book pretty easy to read and was a pretty fast read."
0," The Cruel Hunters - Sondercommando Direlwanger: In a word...disappointing. MacLean manages to confuse reams of irrelevant information regarding promotions and personal information of anonymous SS men as salient to the story. The translations from German to English are poorly done (they read in many cases as literal translations) and the few worthy anecdotes that a reader truly interested in Oskar Dirlewanger and his role in history will find could easily have been condensed into thirty pages. Pictures are somewhat interesting but nothing unique. Listings of SS personnel having served with Dirlewanger is of some value. Printed in China and looks it. At the price, I'd recommend that you take a pass."
1," Fantastic, Can't put it down!: I read this book a few years ago. I absolutely LOVED it. I couldn't put it down. Some stories are not very erotic, they are mostly romantic, but which woman doesn't like romanticism, specially, about those fairy tales we heard as young girls. I read the book faster than I would've want to and so I was left with the desire of the next book. Also, this book can be read at any time because it's not a vulgar erotic. I truly recommend this book to any woman who is true to herself and like a little spice in her life without embarrassment. Beauty and the Beast was the best.The 2nd book I like, but don't love... see review for Enchanted Again"
1," His best: His voice remains as clear and beautiful as it did on SweetBaby James many years ago. No one can beat James Taylor in a live performance and this double CD captures all that is great about James Taylor live. He plays with unbelievable musicians and has amazing back up singers who he has worked with forever. If you have ever seen James Taylor in concert, buy this and it will bring you right back there.This is definitely in my top ten CD's of all time. Don't loan it to friends though, as I have had to replace it about 5 times because my friends want to keep it!"
1," One of the most original and happy CDs ever made: I so loved this disc that I played it as bumper music on my radio talk show for two entire hours. Listeners kept e-mailing me for the title, they were so taken with it. Whether you love Bach (as I do) or Brazilian music (as I do) or just love to be made happy by music (as we all do), this CD will become a desert island disc. It combines Bach's profundity with Brazilian joie de vivre -- quite a potent combo. It is brilliantly arranged and superbly recorded. ..."
1, Ghosh is Great: I met and introduced Ghosh at my university last year. Got to go to dinner with him and other faculty at Butler University. His work never disappoints me. He is as intersting in person as are his characters. The Calcutte Chromosome is the ultimate page turner. Im almost to the end and I can't wait to snap up my next Ghosh book. Read In an Antique Land too..its awesome!
0," Defective and horrible sound: Surprisingly enough, these headphones came out of the box with the wire already loose and causing some crackling sound when the wires were jostled. Plus, they sound horrible!"
0," OMG BAD: I love low budget horror, in which genre this movie clearly falls. However, it also falls on every other relevant category. I don't categorically love low budget horror, I love low budget horror that has something outstanding to deliver, like a good concept, decent acting, creative camera work, etc. None of these elements is present in this film. Honestly, the story is completely incomprehensible throughout; someone just decided to make a movie, then threw a bunch of nonsense together in no particular order and called it a movie. Avoid this movie. There are far many other options that provide something interesting and not waste your time."
0," A journal of selfishness and self-indulgence...: I put this book down in disgust tonight, vowing to go no further when I reached the end of the Italy part. This is a very personal memoir, and while the writing is good at times, the author is someone I would personally not like to know. Selfish and self-indulgent, the author will never grow up no matter how far she travels."
0, Too rough!: I wanted a soft bristle brush for my face. This one is too rough and leaves my face raw. Not recommended.
1," They are ""fine."": These leggings are fine--not great, but nothing wrong with them either. They are fairly thin, though, so if you are looking for somewhat thick leggings (as I was), these are not for you. Fine for warmer weather, but not leggings that will help keep your legs warm."
0," Easily scratched: Folks --I got a few boxes of these black-colored tiles and will never buy them again, unless they get a better color coat or a few protective coats over that. They scratch *very* easily, and it's impossible to buff out the scratches.Avoid at all costs!(Note: The chrome and brushed-aluminum product lines are very nice, and don't rely on a colored coating like these black ones do)Mike"
1," Loved It!: This book was a great read!! If you are into fashion, success, drama, playful humor and you have sister that is totally opposite from you. You will hands down love this book!! I loved everything about it and could not put it down. It was so fun to read!!"
0," Struggling to get through it: I picked this book up a few weeks ago. Opened it and began to read that same night...then it just failed miserably for me. I am going to set it aside and try it again some other time. I can't really give it an appropriate star rating as I have just barely made it to page 50 and its just so terribly ""MEH"""
1," could I buy this book in the book store?: wondering if I can buy this book in the book store, would I have to order the book, becouse it would not be in stock anymore,?"
1," Harry James' hits with much improved 1950s recording quality: Yes, these are remakes of some of Harry James' great songs from the 1930s, but it is great to hear James recorded on first-rate Capitol Records equipment in the mid-1950s. Big Band music is wonderful, and this is much more rewarding to listen to than the scratchy old masters from 20 years earlier.More importantly -- this album MOVES. Of course James' trumpet is the star, but Helen Forrest's vocals work perfectly on the several tracks where she appears. Too often, remakes are pale shadows of the original, but in this case Trumpet Blues stands strongly as (1) a great, mostly uptempo album with classic James tunes and (2) an acceptably high fidelity recording.If you have never bought a Harry James album, this would be a good place to start -- a solid introduction to his music, without the distraction of the uneven early recordings. Be assured it is really James playing, not someone else trying to pay tribute!Recommended."
0," WARNING!! Don't believe it!: This CD does NOT contain the 10 songs that [are listed]!!Rather it contains the 8 songs you can see on the cover picture. For example, Country Road and Pressure Drop is NOT included. This is not the Funky Kingston album but a collection of songs from that album and some others. Buy the real Funky Kingston album instead!!"
1," best price around: This is the best price I've found for this particular swing, which isn't readily available in stores. Most places have the hard plastic seated swings which I don't think are as comfortable or as secure for my toddler who's just learning the fine art of swinging. This one contours nicely to her tushy so she doesn't slide off as easily."
1, It is great for novices: If you ...need tips desperately or if you are just a novice then this is really good for you. I was a novice and now i am a reasonable threat esp. in team battles.

1," I've Always Enjoyed This Album: I know a lot of people didn't care for this Chicago album much but I always have. I remember being a kid when my father bought it and I used to listen to it over and over again. When I became an adult, I bought my own album and still listen to it quite a bit. It's definitly not the ""old"" Chicago sound like Make Me Smile, Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is, etc, but they use those famous horns!"
0, Not as good as others - would NOT recommend: My daughter is 2 years old and we recently got her started on paint with water books. She loves to do them but they are very hard to find in the stores. We have bought the Little People books several times and they are very colorful. Since she had already done 3 of those books we wanted something different and bought the Blue's Clues paint with water book when we saw it. I was very disappointed because the colors were very bland and gray. I would not recommend this book.
1, Excellent!: This is a well made product at a great price! Very closet efficient way to store and view your belts.
0," Just doesn't work: like throwing $11 out the window: This is a single lead test stick. It likely cost $0.10 to make. Yet they charge $11 and -- worst of all -- it simply doesn't work. They have three possible outcomes: 1) no lead; 2) lead; and 3) sorry -- didn't work. But no refund policy and no replacement.Short story, shorter: don't buy it."

0," review of book: I really was not impressed with this book. Like so many authors- or people for that matter, he reveals God as if he were outside of ourselves, when this simply is notthe truth. God is within and this is where people need to go - within themselves to seek the true nature of God's oneness - instead of reaching into the skyfor the man with a white beard who is going to judge you some day.I really thought that the author was much more universally aware and enlightened. I was very disappointed with the book, sorry.Thanks, Debbie"
0," ho hum: you know the way pamela writes is so bragadocious and condescending, it really turned me off.. i had wanted to read her other books, but after not even finishing this book, i will not be reading any more of her books"
0," Bad Investment.: I feel that I overpaid for this item. I could have found it at Duane Read drugstore for half the price that I paid for it. In addition, one of the screw was missing and it requires a great deal of effort to assemble it together."
0, The worse coffee machine ever!: I bought 2 which only lasted a total of 5 months. They just stopped. The travel mugs fell apart. Not worth the money.

1," Rob: Hugh Laurie, fantastic as always. Some great twists in this series with the most fantastic last two episodes of any programme in years."
0," Not realistic - contrived.: I was struck by this younger officer who was the ONLY physicist in the U.S. to know that the sinking wasn't an accident. Didn't other physicists learn the same things in Nuclear Fission 101? In today's world, Good Morning America and Today would have trotted out their own pet nuclear experts the very next morning and theories would have been bouncing off TV satellites. Give me a break!! An admiral that shakes his fist in the air and exclaims ""What a man!"" (about the pres) The admiral was so juvenile that I began fearing for our national safety. The admiral's chief thrill in life was driving at 100+ MPH down the B/W Parkway. Anyone who drives the Parkway would be more than happy to see him busted---the Parkway is not a place for excessive speeds especially from such a low-level mind. The ending was even worse. Sorry I listened to the tape. Luckily I borrowed from the library and didn't buy."
0, Too goofy for me: At first I had hopes of enjoying a good comedy but sticking with it wore me out with the over the top silliness. I would recommend this to viewers that are not offended easily and are entertained with far-fetched comedy.
0," Terrible - a huge disappointment: Just awful. Horrendously overpriced for a crappy, poorly-made item. The ""chrome"" is shiny plastic and very cheap looking. The mechanism barely works (and don't bother trying to use this if you've got even a touch of arthritis OR if you have normal-sized hands -- this is made for giant monster hands). It doesn't crank smoothly or evenly. And the pepper comes out a mix of dust and huge chunks (when it comes out at all) -- for every ten squeezes, you get maybe 1/32 teaspoon of pepper. It would take forever to season whatever you're cooking. There's nothing useful about this product. And there's nothing very nice about it, either. It looks so lovely in the pictures, all sleek and modern and sturdy. But in actuality, it feels and looks like a five-dollar bargain bin item. This is surprising from Trudeau; I own and adore many of their products and find them all to be of excellent quality."
1," Good observations from an uncooperative psychologist: When I created my website in 2003, aliensandchildren.org, I included drawings from Malchiodi's book on the site to compare it to what I had, because the comparison was important. Cathy Malchiodi ordered me to remove the drawings from her book, which I did. As of 2012 I am still working with the children who made the drawings and getting more drawings from other children. I believe the drawings will lead us to the real cause of the autism epidemic and provide real evidence of the abduction of children by aliens from space. The comparison of the drawings was very important for the authenticity and information of aliensandchildren.org. If and when I get real evidence of alien abductions, perhaps Cathy Malchiodi may give me permission to quote her book again.It's a very informative and interesting book on its own."
1," Retired Air Force officer, Kunsan City, South Korea: This book is of great value in the sense that it is a piece of living history. I've lived here in Kunsan for a few years and this book really enlightened me about a few things. The dirt road to Kunsan is now a four-lane highway; the levee he describes in the book is still there; the dependent housing he built used to be the old ROKAF NCO houses (now deserted); and the base roads are basically the same routes as in 1947. Yes, things change, but at the same time they remain the same. I loved the book. Thanks, Fred."
0," Ludicrous ...: The premise is simply not believable. The idea that tattoos and notes on Polaroid pictures could be an adequate information storage and retrieval mechanism for carrying out even the simplest of daily tasks is hardly worth dispelling, but after noting 10 or 20 instances in the first hour of the movie in which the protagonist generated ""new"" memory I stopped watching. Running the plot backward in time adds eccentricity and confusion, but little else to the movie."
1," ear freindly for parents: I bought this for my two girls. We love it! The songs are not the same as on Noggin, but they are just as fun. Most of the songs my 4 year old can remember and we sing them around the house. The clean up song is a staple at cleanup time. The old favorites and the new songs are up beat enough that the entire family can enjoy this CD in the car. A CD for children that does not make me sick at my stomach if we listen to it one more time."
0," Just OK - NOT worth the money!: My daughter does enjoy this kitchen - however, it is NOT worth the money! Within a few days one of the knobs on the oven fell off as did the faucet for the sink. Also, it's made out of cheaper grade plastic and is not very durable. Although my daughter does have fun with the kitche, I'd definitely spend the extra money to get her a step 2 or little tikes one that is more durable."
0, Good potential spoiled by bad DRM.: I was really looking forward to this game and planned on purchasing it until I found out it was infected with Securom DRM. No Thanks!!!
1," Still the best: Not only the best Western of all time,but also one of the greatest movies of all time.It has it all,it has drama,it has suspense,but most importantly...it has Wayne,the Duke delivers(probably)his greatest performance of his long, outstanding career,and it has John Ford's beautifull romantic direction.Even non fans of the genre will enjoy this movie.

1," Very secure at 34"": I am very happy with this gate and would recommend it. Very secure, and easy to install. Looks good, too.Here is just a little info I would have liked to know beforehand:Our doorway is just under 33.5"" wide at the bottom, 34"" at the top, so I purchased 1 extension, thinking the gate would not be very secure without it at the upper end of the 29-34"" range specified. But with the extension, it's just too wide to fit. Without the extension, it is not wobbly at all, and as secure as you can get without a permenant gate. I wouldn't go past 34"", though. If the extension fits, I'd use it.Since it's pressure mounted, the top of the gate is an inch away from the latch when it's not installed. When properly installed, it's squeezed together for a perfect fit.The pressure mounting pads are located right at the bottom of the wall. We have a small 1/2"" wood molding around our kitchen floor, and had to remove a small section of it to have a flat surface for them. Not a big deal."
0, Lasted 13 months then died: Not a good quality product. I ordered it in May of 2007 and now June 2008 I am looking for another. There are very few made these days. I don't want another of these but may end up with it anyway.
1," This album is the best album I ever heard.: Janet Jackson's album ""The Velvet Rope"" is very satisfying. This album shows that she has a great talent in music. Especially the song ""I get Lonely"" is a typical type of song of Jackson's family."
1, satisfied customer: I am very satisfied with the pneumatic nailer I purchased recently formy home projects. Thank you for the quick delivery.Adam Garcia

1, Loved it!: Dr. Auerbach did a great job on this one. The medical information/references are extremely accurate too - he really knows his stuff. Well worth the read!
0," Water based mascara can dry up easily: When I received the water based mascara for sensitive eyes, it was completely dried out to the point it was not even applicable. I told Zhen Beauty about this and they sent me a replacement mascara right away. I found that very professional of them. Still, the second mascara was less dried up but still too dry and flakey. i believe that this might be due to the nature of the product. It's water-based consistency probably makes it difficult to keep it from drying out especially in extreme heat (or cold) during delivery. I appreciated Zhen Beauty's customer service and will consider buying more products from them in the future but not this product."
1," Haven't seen the movie, but enjoyed the book!: The book was recommended to me before the movie was announced. I purchased it at an independent bookstore, and didn't read it for several years. When I finally got around to it . . . well, all I can say is that I was fairly entertained. I can't imagine why anyone would actually WANT to cook that much! But I was entertained, if a little grossed out, by the story. I haven't been able to eat lobster since, and have eaten very little chicken. But I did go out and buy a lot of butter, and cooked with it more often. I don't know what that says -- all those recipes, and the thing that appealed to me was cooking with butter . . . maybe I am just not attracted to French cooking . . .I think I'll skip the movie."
1, Great for a bird lover.: This is a nice product. Easy to apply. Brings birds right up to your window for your enjoyment. Easy to clean and fill.
1," Awesome Product!!!: Service good, arrive on time like the website said, great price, i will do business again with this company, i recommended"
1," As expected: This is my first violin so I did not want to spend a lot. Previous reviews stated that the strings supplied would break when you tuned them, and sure enough they did, so not surprised. Once the strings were replaced I've had no problems since, and this violin has been working and playing great. If you're looking to see if you may like the violin, want to get the basics of playing and fingering, and do not want to disturb all those around you, this would be a good choice. The cons are the ear-phone supplied -there is a hiss, but then again, like the strings, I'm sure they're cheep. Saying that, I really do not use them at all as there is plenty of sound, just not enough to bother all those around you."
1," Wonderful example of design and illustration: This book is wonderful. I love the way Alisher Dianov illustrates his childrens books. This book would be a fine addition to any library, child or adult."
1," Powerful album...: I live in a small town in central Montana. It is absolutely hysterical when I pull up to a stop light playing this CD at what is probably an illegal volume, and people start to get angry and yell at me to turn it down, and then they hear the lyrics. Watching them stammer as they realize that I am pumping Christian music out at these volumes cracks me up every time. LeCrae speaks clearly, and boldly in this album. And the message of salvation and God's love for us is evident in every word. Father God, continue to bless LeCrae and all that he does in Your name. Let his music continue to reach those that need to be reached, so that Your love can be brought to them."
1," Good listen of a good read: Several friends warned me that trying to listen to The Silmarillion while driving could be asking to fall asleep at the wheel. On the contrary, I found Martin Shaw's reading of this classic to be a very pleasant way to experience Tolkien's unabridged work. Shaw has a powerful, engaging voice and since there is very little dialogue in The Silmarillion, he doesn't need to adopt many different personalities in his delivery. Many other reviewers have covered this title from the perspective of its greatness in a literary sense so I won't bother adding to that. But as far as the quality of this audio book edition, I give it full marks."
1," Outstanding book for all ages!: I first read the book ""Alice"" when I was about 13 or 14. It remains one of my favorite books of all time. The expression of unconditional love that is shown is something everyone could be reminded of now and again. I hope to read it to my children someday."
0," they should have hanged this pirate: alibertis'voice is beyond discription, with one exception. Ms aliberti has about three notes in her voice that sound just like maria callas, unfortunatly those are the only three good notes she has! The rest of the cast is a little less exciting"
0," Not the Correct Item: Beware of ordering from Amazon partner vendors. You might be better off going to them directly. When I ordered the power adapter, it was not clear in the Amazon listing which was the correct model number for the digital recorder I also purchased. When I discovered the mismatch upon receiving the merchandise, I had to return the adapter to the 3rd party vendor, and I was not refunded the full purchase amount. :("

1," Right tool for the job...: I have had my DC 14 for about 6 months now. As a middle-aged bachelor with few visitors to my home, cleaning my home ranks well below watching NFL football on the weekends. My home has a mix of berber carpet and hardwood floors. I have never spent this much money on any cleaning tool...My initial impressions were slight disappointment and reflected on the one and two star reviews I had read here. But, after six months, I can comfortable say this vacuum cleaner has become very intuitive and effective. Stairs, hardwood floors and dusty trim boards get the treatment easily.I would highly recommend this.The only improvement I would like to see is a little longer hose.UPDATE January 2013: I was surfing my other Amazon reviews. I still have this vacuum cleaner and it STILL works great. So happy with my purchase."
1," Still the best single disc compilation of YES's career!: By now, there have been numerous YES greatest hits packages, including two large box sets; yet this is the compilation I keep coming back to because it captures YES at the heart of their progressive stardom from 1971 through 1977.You get full-length versions here, including ""Long Distance Runaround"" immediately followed by ""The Fish"". You also get ""And You And I"", which has managed not to be featured on many other YES compilations. Pity, because it's one of their most enchanting songs; although I believe on the YESYEARS box set, there is a live version recorded during the Trevor Rabin years.The only down side is that ""Roundabout"" and ""I've Seen All Good People"" are live versions taken from their 1979 tour. While they're still enjoyable tunes, the original full-length version would have made this CD perfect."
0," Not worth it even if cheap: I got these headphones for 30 bucks thinking YES!!! They were horrible in the gym. The volume control instantly failed and then the track selector. But, wait, that isn't the worst part. For folks that lay on their back for any exercise in the gym, don't get these. They really aren't that loud to begin with, but when you lay down say for bench, the back part pushes against your neck, and then the ear buds pop out. Now you don't hear any music.If you are just going on a road trip and can get these for cheap,...maybe then, but not for the gym."
0," NO SALE!: I will not buy this. I know perfectly well that they will be releasing the extended editions, and will not waste my money, which I know is exactly what they want us to do. I like both versions, and own both on DVD, but won't replace them both on Blu-Ray. Hollywood's shameless attempts at squeezing customers for every last penny is starting to become offensive."
0, Another bad live Zeppelin performance.: I wonder if they used studio musicians to record the albums. Cause they never sound very good live. Maybe if they stopped hot dogging long enough to remember what they are playing.I am a huge Zep fan. But I just dont get why they cant sound good live.

0," Misleading Title--Has not been updated since 1996!: I bought this partially because the cover said ""New SAT"" on it only to find out that a) the last time this book was updated was 1996 and b) it still has a section on quantitative comparisons.It has NOT been revised for the New SAT. Having said that it does have a few shortcuts that seem worthwhile to know but I would not recommend having a student read it cover to cover. It's a shame that haven't updated the book because the concept of teaching shortcuts is worthwhile."
1," Decent for the price: I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact that in less that a week of use a string broke so I had to have it replaced. No biggie, I'll probably go back and replace the rest of the strings (I would have done so already but my local music shop was out of the sets). I didn't expect a top end piece for the price but my daughter absolutely loves this violin and was dying to go back to school after the winter break to show it off! Also, I was just told by my daughter that we'll need to replace the bow it is hard to tighten properly to produce the correct sounds. But all in all I would by it again."

1," fun read, a glimpse at the past: After finding an ancient copy of ""Tom Swift and his flying machine"" in my fathers effects, I decided to see if it was available on the Kindle. To my amazement it was. I purchased the whole set. These books were written for youngsters early in the nineteen hundreds when there was an abundance of emerging technology that we now take for granted. Besides being just plain fun to read they present an interesting glimpse into how people in the twenties perceived these new fangled contraptions."

1, Brilliant: The movie starts off when he is in the Vietnam war and try's to save some Innocent people but Dolph Lundgren shoot's them so they get into a little Brawl and they shoot eachother and there dead so a couple of years later he get's brought back to life as a universal soldier and then start's to remember his past life and go's with a journalist to find more answers and dolph try's to stop them and at the end was the best part because of so much suspense and action it must have been the most electrifying Action sequals in the History of Action Films so obviously it's a fantastic film.
0," Good for a disposable printer, it just doesn't last long: After owning a seperate scanner and printer for awhile, I bought this combined unit to save some desk space. The price seemed right, and I didn't need the extra fancy features of the more expensive units, such as the LCD screen etc.To me, HP should have removed the memory card slots and put more engineering into the paper feed tray. My unit has worked flawlessly for about a year (or maybe less). I was very excited about the copy feature and scanner as it worked so well.But now as I sit, the paper tray will not feed paper. One sheet, multiple sheets, the tray will not grab the paper. I suspect to fix this unit, it will cost more than what I paid for it originally. The scanner still works wonderfully.If you search online, there are some other people that have experienced this same thing. I haven't even burned thru the original ink cartridges yet. Very disappointing."
1, It works: I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews. It works. I used it once i was laying down and had no side effects and it has cleared all effects within 24 hours.
0," Not satisfied.: We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically..."
1," Horrible truth: It's incredible and horrible truth,very detailed and never should have happened and never should repeat. Even as more than sixty years have gone by,this book is the monument of unbelievevel cruelty and horrors of war.The book deserves the best rating possible."
1," Slow paced, but must pe patient.: Again just like the first DVD volume, this contain only three episodes. Most likely because the entire series is mere 14 episoeds. In this volume, Elk meets Arc and more of Elk's past is uncover. There was not much figting scenes as hoped, but the story is progressing slowly. Not to spoil,but one could probably tell who the real villain is in the serie from this volume. I'm still looking for something that'll hype up this Anime, but none here. Hopefully, in the next volume the story will be more intense and more fighting action scenes. Just like the first volume, the extra consist of some previews and a ADV compilation. Overall, this volume is satisfactory. This serie needs to start a moving to the point."
0, A begining: some of the music is very good but alot of this CD wasn't what i expect and maybe other might say different but this is what i fill from it.
1," ""Winchester"" 4x32 Scope w/Rings?: I didn't know that Winchester even made scopes until I saw this one. I did an online search to find a scope for my Winchester, Model 9410,410 Bore, Lever Action Shotgun and this scope is what I found. I was delighted that it was a ""Winchester"" because I have never had aproblem out of anything (Rifles, Shotguns, Ammunition, Etc.) made by Winchester!!! I load my own slugs using brass .410 shotgun hulls and .41 Caliber and 405 Winchester Caliber bullets. I have taken 6 Whitetails, 2 Antelope, 5 Bob Cats and 37 Cayotes using this scope andmy ""Homemade Slugs"". The bores on my .410 Bore shotguns vary from .408"" to .413""."
0," A few shortcomings: First. the base is very lightweight - weighing less than any blow dryer I own. So I fought it continually falling over. Because of an arm injury, I had to use it, so I went to the athletic store and purchased a 5 lb weight which sits on the base and keeps it upright -- inexpensive solution, but a pain. Secondly, when you raise or lower it, the catch doesn't hold well. So when you reach to adjust the angle of the dryer on the flexible neck, the extension rod regularly gives way and collapses. Works in a pinch like I'm in where you only have one arm. But don't buy it thinking it will improve a two-handed world."
0," Run away! Run away!: Don't waste your money on this one.I happily (because I didn't waste my money) borrowed this from a local academic library. I'm glad I read it, because I learned a lot about what I don't like.Bloom doesn't like Lord of the Rings, so why he even bothers to assemble these old, dated, and tired essays is beyond me, unless it is to make money off the LOTR craze. His one-page introduction is an insult; he doesn't ever explain why he included any of the essays in this collection nor does he contribute any insight regarding Tolkien's work (I suspect he didn't have any).I was amused, then annoyed by what he included: outdated Jungian comparisons to the Hobbit, a poorly-written history of the publication of Lord of the Rings. The one notable exception is Tom Shippey's chapter from Road to Middle Earth, but you're better off reading Shippey's book, or any of his books, than wasting your time with this one."
1," AMAZING!!: My physical therapist recommended that I purchase the Occipivot system to relieve stress in my neck. I really does work!!In just a few minutes a day, pressure is relieved and my stress headaches have subsided.I highly recommend this product."
1," This movie is the second Bomb! [He He He]- Jimmy D.: This movie, Directed By masterer Steven Spielberg is one of the best Spielberg films ever! It is based upon The bestselling novel by Peter Benchley [THE BEAST]. It is about a shark who is being territorial and is attcaking people of a small summer resort community. A young girl goes for a midnight swim in the ocean, and never returns to the surface again. Police Chief Martin Brody [Roy Schieder] belives that there is a shark around, but the town Fathers try to hide the attack up and call it a [boat accident]. Then on the fourth of July they all soon find out that there is a shark around and they hirer a fisherman [Robert Shaw] to kill it! Filled with non stop suspence, and horro I give this 4 stars! END"
1," Best Canadian Show Ever: I love Corner Gas. I first saw it in the middle of the night on WGN and fell in love imediately. Luckily, my birthday was only a few weeks away, so I asked for the first 5 seasons of the show (season six wasn't out yet.) On a lark, I looked the set up on the amazon.ca and found that all the sets are far less than half of what they cost on amazon.com. This season 2 costs 49.49 on amazon.com but only costs 16.33 united states dollars on amazon.ca. If you love the show as much as I do, and especially if you just want to check the show out if you've only seen a few episodes, get the set from amazon.ca and save yourself 30 dollars."
1," Healthy Lifestyle: The massager, being soft, flexable has made it possible for me to exercise,stretch and strengthen my skin, blood flow and muscles. I have a disease called scleroderma that made intercourse so painful, that my husband and I could not have intercourse for years. Using the Flexable Jelly Soft Body y2 Massager,Blue has also made me have orgasm easier. Exercising with it 4 or so times a week, makes sclerotic skin, muscles and circulation 100% less painful! Thank you, sincerely. MY husband and I can be intimate without pain. God bless you."
1," Indescribable: My friend is a cheap-70's-horror movie buff, and I'm not. I figured I was in for a good laugh with this one, but I was wrong. I figured I'd fall asleep after the laugh, but I was wrong. Instead, I didn't take my eyes off the TV until my friend turned off the VCR. Not to sound overly dramatic, but Suspiria is completely stunning and unlike any of my friend's other cheap 70's horror movies. I haven't seen photography like it anywhere else; it's almost like an elaborate, freaked out home video. It impressed me so much that I had to do it justice by writing a review for it. A very strange, amazing movie, whether you get scared or not."
0," Worst book I've ever finished: The Pelican Brief is without a doubt the worst book I've ever finished. (I've dropped a few worse books midway through, but I was stuck on an airplane for 10 hours with only a copy of The Pelican Brief so I had no choice but to finish it.) The biggest problem with the book is that the plot makes absolutely no sense. Think about it. The Darby character has NO direct evidence with respect to her theory. Once she's passed the information on to the authorities, killing her does nothing but validate the theory. So if they had succeeded in killing her, it's highly likely that the authorities would eventually figure out that her theory was valid. As a result, Darby's fate is irrelevant. This book is one of the reasons that I never read anything on the best seller list (except for freakish exceptions like Pynchon and DeLillo). Oh, I just remembered one book I read that was even worse (Patriot Games, further support for my policy of avoiding best sellers)."
1," Excellent: An excellent book, truly authentic, great recipes written by a lady who knows the cuisine & culture. Would recommend to anywone who wants to cook & know more about Lebanese Food"
0," Stay away, you will regret using this software: Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
1," UTOC? Try cleaning it!: I've had my 702 for over two years now, and it still works fairly well. Yes, I said two years - and I still only paid about $75 more than the list price on this discontinued model.About a year in, I got the infamous --- UTOC error --- on a disk. Went to Best Buy and bought a Maxell MD cleaner (after taking the silly thing apart, etc. trying to ""fix"" it). Ran the cleaner three times, and everything was fine. I can still record, but I have to clean it more often now (every couple of months), or I get the errors (or skipping disks) again. I run my 702 between 8 and 48 hours per week.All I can say is: if you have a cleaner for your CD player, and your DVD player, and your VCR, and a cleaner for your cassette player, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR MD? If you have a dead 702 because of UTOC, why don't you spend a few bucks and see if you can fix it?"
1," Excellent summer party disc: My son and i heard this disc playing at a store at the mall. They were promoting the CD player, but we were captivated by the music. Crisp latin rhythms and brass make this an excellent collection of latin classics and other classics played in mambo style. I wish they had more CD's available!"
0," Don't Curl My Hair...???: I bought this the other day and they were $22.77 w/ Prime Shipping. And now it says almost $8 shipping, and $29.99. So that's weird that it's so much more expensive now. (it's still $22.77 @ Walmart.)Anyways, these didn't curl my hair. They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy. (I have naturally straight, thick hair.) See that girl who posted 2 pictures, one w/ curly hair and one w/ straightish hair? The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes. This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair. My favorite curling iron is Conair's infiniti curling wand. (I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).The clips also didn't hold very well. Pieces of my hair kept falling out of the curlers. (Don't think, ""Oh, that's why it didn't curl her hair!"" because that's not true. Some of the pieces DIDN'T fall out, and even they didn't curl.)"
0," Boring, disjointed, poorly edited: This is one of the most boring books I've ever struggled through. Semi-autobiographical, it has the feeling of a hurried effort whose real goal was to make money. While the adoration of his father is laudable, it was twisted into a self-serving enumeration of author's many virtues and how he acquired them.Maybe all autobiographies require a certain tolerance from the reader, but my supply was quickly exhausted. Russert throws in multiple vignettes per page - some related, some not - lumping platitude upon platitude, as if quantity were better than quality.Worse, it's full of errors that should have been caught by a half-decent editor. A glaring example: everyone knows the prayer before a meal (""Bless us oh Lord...""), but he gets it wrong, saying ""...THROUGH thy bounty, through Christ our Lord..."" instead of ""...FROM thy bounty, through Christ our Lord..."" Clangers like that plus his transparent motive reduce this book to the level of a B movie."
0," Does the job, but not impressive: I looked at a few other dumpling presses on Amazon before going with Helen's Dumpling Press. I liked that the press had handles.The dough needs to be the exact round shape as the press, if not--if the dough drapes over the edge, a knife or something sharp is necessary to cut off the excess dough. The press merely presses the edges together. The pleated edge looks nice and is about the same width as the ""stuffed"" part of the dumpling. Be careful while pressing because the hinges tend to pinch the dumpling/dough.This press is time consuming to use (i.e. getting it to work correctly and properly). Also, the plastic does not seem very durable; the ""handles"" bend easily. In the end, I just made the dumplings by hand (ans the press).I gave it 1 star for ease of use and for time-saving."
1," Great Product, Fast Service: I was pleasantly pleased with the matches that I recieved. The service was prompt and the matches looked very nice. I was able to get more wording on the matches than we originally thought and the seller assured me I would have them by the time I needed them. I think it was 2-3 days turn around. I will definitely use this seller again and highly recommend.Once you place your order online be sure to call or email the seller with the additional details you need to provide for what to emboss on the stamps and the color of the lettering."
1, Ecxellence: The book is an ecxellence guide to apply UML in the enterprise modeling. Usefull also the Business Patterns.
1," I may be a kid, but this is AWESOME: I love adope photodeluxe. I never use it to repair photos, but I'm sure it would be great for that too. No, I use it to draw. I'm a kid but I can make things look AWESOME with this. You can make it so the shadows are smooth and you can make it look real... Words do not define my love for this program. Without it I don't know what I would do. It has tons of features, like smudging, textures, and loads of other things. Also, unlike MS Paint, when you use the brush button it's smooth looking instead of rough and bumpy. It is awesome for an artist like me, and way cheaper than photoshop. If you like artsy stuff, then I have three words for you... GET IT, MAN!"
0, Bad recommendation: Fast delivery. I gave it 2 stars because it was the wrong size. I ordered a carrier for my cat and it recommended I buy this item to go with it. I thought that was a nice suggestion until I received it and it was way too big for the carrier. Now I have to deal with returning it.
1, Use Regularly: The only shortcoming is the range of the wireless receiver. Could be much greater. Understand the later version corrected that issue. The battery door access to on/off is not a problem for me.
0," What Were You Expecting???: MTV churns out brainless crap 24 hours a day, they inflicted Tom Green, Andy Dick and Jessica Simpson upon us.Was anybody really thinking that they were saving their best work for the big screen??This is as good as it gets folks."
1," Delicious, but more like milk chocolate than ""dark."": These are delicious, no doubt about it! However, they taste more like a cross between milk chocolate and dark... I realized immediately upon eating the first one that I should have bought the ""60% Extra Dark"" version of this product (they are wrapped with black foil, not blue). If you want a taste that is more middle-of-the-road, then go with these, but if you want that dark chocolate richness and ""edge,"" go with the Extra Dark."
1," Great mp3 player: This is a great mp3 player, very easy to use and even easier to load data and or music tanks to the USB build in connection this will help because you don't have to worry about the connection cable, the headphones will help you to not to lose it, the only disadvantage is the way you have to search the music, song by song even more when you have more that 100 songs. But nonetheless is a great item. Got one for my self and one as gift."
0," not as shown: I ordered Thera-Bands 5"" x 5'. What I received from HPMS Inc. were bands 3 3/4"" x 4' with different elasticity from the brand name Thera-Bands. They were packaged in a unlabeled plastic bag. Would not recommend them as a replacement for Thera-Bands."
1, Positive efffects: In my opinion this is an effective supplement. I felt a measurable smoothness in the digestion process such as less bloating less crumbling sound in my stomach and I became more regular after a history of irregularity. I did not detect any annoying side effects. I am satisfied
1," I stayed up until 5 am reading it.: This book blew me away. The key to its riveting style, I think, was the author's portrayal of the brokenness and vulnerability of Bonhoeffer, someone I always had on a pedestal. I literally could not put it down and stayed up the entire night reading!"
0," very so so: I have been looking for a replacement for Harry and Davids Balsamic Vinegar which has a soft light taste, this product was so strong it was unpaletable."
0," Ehhhh....: I can't say that this is a bad album, but not really that great either. In my opinion Tommy should stick to what he knows best, and that is the drums. But I do give him credit for branching out. There are a couple good songs on this album. Hello Again is a good tune, the acoustic version being the better of the two. Good Times is not a bad song either. But it all falls into the washedout boring style of pop rock bands like Nickleback is known for. A popular style in todays industry; yes, but boring none the less. There are no memorable / catchy riffs or choruses, nothing to tap your foot too. For each time I sat down to give it a listen to, I found myself falling asleep, daydreaming, or turning it off out of boredom.Tommy is a great musician, but he needs to stop hopping along on everybodies bandwagons, and start driving his own. Maybe then he will release something worth listening to. Until then, I'll stick with his fellow Crue member, Nikki Sixx, and is Brides of Destruction."
0," Defective DVD returned, awaiting proper replacement: The BoneyM DVD I received was defective - several song recordings would not play well. The item was returned to the despatcher address (recorded delivery), and I am yet to hear from them about a proper replacement.Will Amazon kindly let me know when I can get a proper non-defective replacement?"
0," nice, but no handle: the mat is fine for pilates.No handle or strap to tie together makes it hard to carry.returned to buy one with a handle."
1," Great book!: I'd really have to say this is one of the best books I've read in a long time.I could NOT put it down. From the first chapter telling of where he gre up and how he got into wrestling, to the last few chapters from his first couple years in the WWF, it was amazing. The best part was that as his story went on, I started remembering the things he was talking about, as I had seen them on TV. His ending with himself winning the World title was the greatest, because I remember wtching that very moment on TV!I can't say any more, it was an amazing book!"
0," Completely stupid movie: I couldn't even finish watching this movie it was so stupid. I like funny movies, dumb humor, wisecracks, but the re-appearing bum and 2 rappers that start following him just ruined the movie's premise. If there were ""negative"" stars, this movie would get them"
1," vicki802: This is one of the best classic TV shows , it is a must for the family or those that enjoyed watching it when they grew up."
1, This is one of her greatest.: Julie Garwood is one of the best. This book is one that every fan of hers should read. I love the characters and the story.
0," Warning...: SPOILER ALERT, if you care...the heroine is raped in this book (not by the hero, thankfully, but still) I had been enjoying the book but this *highly unnecessary* plot device ripped me right out of the story and I was so disappointed. It may not bother many readers, but if you dislike rape in your romance as much as I do, I feel you should be given a heads-up. I wish I had known ahead of time..."
0," Incoherent: The documentary doesn't have an arcing narrative, it is a collection of clips and carefully selected interviews. It also serves a single side, while equating the opposition to the evil godless commies."
0," Very disappointed: With all the acclaim for this book, I have to say I was very disappointed. While there were some interesting ""laws,"" this book was a huge waste of time. The entire read felt like an irrelevant lecture from an old man reenacting war stories and trying to make some tie to real life. There are tons of other reads out there that I wish I had been enjoying as opposed to this one."
1," Nice alternative: It was strange to get used to at first; putting it in, taking it out. But once I got used to it, simple. I will only use my diva cup from now on."
0," Microsoft-Centric: Yes, the fine print says ""Covers Microsoft Transact-SQL"". However, I would have expected any book on Transact-SQL to cover more than just the latest SQL Server incarnations. Sybase invented Transact-SQL, but there is no mention of Sybase to be found anywhere in the book.I picked up this book based on recommendations on Amazon as an alternative to the O'Reilly book (which doesn't get very good reviews for the most part). However, we use Sybase and this book is utterly useless for anything other than recent versions of SQL Server.Why couldn't the author have taken the time to actually cover the different major recent incarnations of Transact-SQL listing the differences? I would have rated this book much higher if the title was ""Guru's Guide to Microsoft (and only Microsoft) Transact-SQL (ignoring standard/Sybase Transact-SQL)""."
1," Great first novel: As a Patricia Cornwell lover, I found this book while waiting for the next Cornwell book. What a great first book. Complex and thrilling. I found it hard to put down at times. I look forward to her other books and maturation as an author. Watch out Cornewell."
0," Non-fiction Trash: I would not have purchased this book had I known about the pure fiction told hear. This bookis nothing but a story about an ego-maniac based on inuendo, half-baked facts and made up story-telling. Please take it off the non-fiction list."
1," Pieces of the puzzle!: Thank you for this interesting piece of History! It is sad to see how some ill-wishers, ill-informed press and politically motivated individuals can change the world for personal and partisan interests, or to sell their ""papers""!... It is equally sad to see that the same people who participated in that bloody ""Revolution"" in Iran which changed our world to a less secure and happy place are still attacking the author of this wonderful book with their old slogans, refusing to be more constructive for the generations to come!But ""truth"" will win!Nadereh"
0," What happened to Steve Oliver?: Used to be you could count on Oliver to deliver a solid album of guitar-based smooth jazz, uplifting tunes that made you reach for the volume control, tap your foot, and sing along to the lilting guitar lines.This latest effort is his weakest to date, a mistitled album that seems to have been made on autopilot; the only radiance to be found is in the backlight used in the cover art. There's only one song here that rivals any of the best songs from his 2002 release, Positive Energy, a song called Good to Go that is in fact a pastiche of High Noon.The rest of the album is uninspired smooth jazz. Play it in the background and the only thing that will catch your attention are the three saccharine vocal tracks. I give it a 2, instead of a 1, for being inoffensive background music.If you haven't yet purchased any recordings from Steve Oliver, start with Positive Energy, one of the best contemporary jazz albums of the 00's. Leave Radiant in the bin."
0," Reruns!!!: I don't believe it. ANOTHER Dilbert treasury full of strips already published elsewhere. What possible purpose can this book have other than tricking fast buyers and well-meaning relatives into buying it without knowing what it is? I understand this is a business, and if you have a talent you can make a living off of, more power to you, but this is just a blatant rip-off!"
1, Beautiful: I first heard Allison Krauss last year. I have been a fan ever since. This CD is wonderful and presents Blue Grass Music in very special way. Anyone who appreciates good music will enjoy this collection of songs.
0," My Son finds it annoying: My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
1," Different is good: ""Under The Iron Sea"" is radically different from Keane's previous cd ""Hopes and Fears"" and the difference is wonderful. The album serves up some funky techno sounds and catchy hooks, heavy on synthesizers and great lyrics. Tom Chaplin has improved his breathing control, and although still audible, he no longer sounds heavily congested. Some of the musical arrangements appear to be written specifically to cover his breathing. Whatever they're doing, it works. Several outstanding tracks grace this cd. ""The Hamburg Song"" is a wonderful ballad that reminds the listener of the previous album. ""Broken Toy"" is very good as well as ""Atlantic"" ""Crystal Ball"" (which plays first in reverse then correctly) and ""Is It Any Wonder?"" Forget all the comparisons to Bono and U2. Keane isn't just a U2 knock off band. They deserve credit for their own work."
1," The Grip! surprising album, my review from Barcelona: What a wonderful surprise this GREG KOCH's CD. `The Grip' is not a typical Blues album. It includes several styles but it sure is a terrific guitar exhibition from beginning to end. It's been a long time since I heard such an amazing first track: ""Zoiks"", brilliant. ""Spank It"" is phenomenal; the slow Blues ""Chef's Blues"" is enthralling; there are very good tributes to Jimmy Hendrix in ""Spanish Castle Magic"" and ""Big Jim""; to Eric Clapton in ""Steppin' Out""; and to Albert King in ""Albert's Back""; heavenly sound in ""Drawn My Number""; a little of high level hard Blues in ""The Grip"" and so on. In a few words, a very entertaining and interesting record. I recommend it and I give it 4,5 stars."
1," Well Written and a Good Story.: This was my first read by this author and I was impressed. It was well written with a good story line. I'll be looking for more of her books in the future. In fact, I'm anxious to get the next book, In A Cowboys Embrace, the story about Cliff. Can't wait to see his reaction to Ella and Bryant, along with hearing more about what's going on in their lives."
0, UGH!: I bought this creme 3 weeks ago and have used it twice a day ever since...that is until yesterday! I woke up with redness under my left eye that itched like there was no tomorrow. Now the right eye is the same. This product is not worth it. I wished I would have never purchased it.
1," lovely earrings: i bought these for my niece's birthday. she wanted earrings that she could sleep in. she loved the color and i was impressed by the size. they were not too big but definitely made her feel like she's a ""big girl"". excellent quality."
1," Icelandic tour guide: It wasn't until I visited Iceland that I could understand that Sigur Rus translates the Icelandic landscapes into sounds.Their magical and low paced music is a guided tour through the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss, and órsmörk. Each track makes you feel as if you were walking on the green moss, the ice, and the lava fields of Iceland.I recommend listening to their music while you drive across Iceland. And once you are back home, it will make you remember your Icelandic adventures."
1, Egg parts: Lots of good ideas for using leftover egg parts. True most of the recipes are frenchified but Jaques can always be counted to have good ones.
0," Over-Rated: I've been shaving my head ""traditionally"" for years, stumbled across this product on the internet and decided to give it try. Yes it does provide a less irritating shave, but i could do a better job with a boxcutter. Shaved exactly as the directions state and still had to go over many areas two to three times and still didnt get a close shave. In my opinion it's not worth the price. Go buy a good 4 or 5 blade razor instead."
1, Star Power: Shania is truly a star when it comes to great performances. She sings live and never misses a beat. I love this dvd and I want everyone to see it. Ask for it for your Christmas present. It is well worth it!
0," Unrealistic programming: I have played many tycoon games and some are more difficult than others. However, TV Tycoon has absolutely no chance of winning. The setting is 1954, that is fine, except you begin with a Bank loan of 24,000,000 at an interest RATE of 20% per DAY (yes, that's correct)!!! In the beginning you can only make about 1-2 million a day which barely cover the 1 million dollar a day rental expense for the TV station.. by the time you are making any kind of income, the bank loan has compounded to over 60 million dollars, that would be 12 million a day interest, and at the end of 15 days you will owe over 1 billion dollars. NO way of winning this game! Not fun to always lose. Buy Zoo tycoon or Rollercoaster tycoon, or Resort tycoon, or Farm tycoon or SIM city instead. These games are winable."
0," DVD has scenes changed: I was disappointed with the DVD of this movie, mainly because it was missing scenes I expected to see. I could not find Eric Stoltz' scenes, for example. Apparently they were cut. Surely they could have included cut scenes as a menu option. Other DVD's have this feature. Also the sound is monaural and my SONY player experienced its infamous lipsync problem in parts of this DVD."
0," Broke in no time: While it worked it was ok, but then it just stopped working. And Plantronics support sucks!"
1," Great scissors: I love a good pair of all purpose scissors. Most of the ones that I have had to resort to have been either kitchen or school scissors because any of the others that I have had haven't lasted long. These are sharp, comfortable, light weight and useful in many ways. I love them for all of the irritating plastic packaging that everything comes in now. They cut different papers and plastic very well. I have also used them to cut a few fabrics, yarns and dog hair. They have done a good job on everything so far. I also have a pair of the Scotch Precision Scissor, 8-Inches (1448) that I used to use a lot, but I kept loosing them. They have a similar feel and seems to work the same, but I will update my reviews if one or the other falls apart. I haven't used them for anything hardcore because I have heavy duty utility shears for those purposes. Overall, they are good to have and I think that everyone can use a second pair to loose or put away. I would recommend these."
0," Robot hard at work.: This book seems like it was written by twiggy from Buck Rogers. We are taking advice on Global Warming from Al ""747"" Gore. How many thousands of gallons of jet fuel was used in the promotion of this book? Another example of ""Do as I say, not as I do."""

Sometimes can be tricky after cleaning the machine if you don't get the bottom tank on correctly - then it will not produce any suction but it is an easy fix. Does a great job cleaning my carpets, especially since they need frequent cleanings with a dog and toddler!"

0," letdown: the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good."
1," Thrilled: Thank you for the quick shipping and quality product. Excellent. My son has been playing this game for years, and they continue to wear out. I'm thankful that you still had it available."
0, Did not work properly: One of the watch faces does not work at all and it never did. Have tried to deal with the manufacturer to find out the problem and fix it (and sundry others) but nobody replies to my emails. Not happy.
1," Reads more like Elmore Leonard than the old Wambaugh.: Much, much more fun than previous work. My wife and I both laughed out loud while reading Finnegan's Week. It's larger than life, but believable all the way. In our opinion, this is Wambaugh's best novel."
0," I was hoping...: I bought Lord Sin after reading the reviews posted below, and I must say that I wish I hadn't! This is VERY far from being ""historical romance at its best"" (although it's a great example of why romance novels have gotten a bad rap).In the first chapter alone I thought I was going to scream if Kalen Hughes used the word ""humanity"" once more to describe a crowd. She's also fond of throwing in what appear to me to be random vocab words of yore in order to validate the historical time frame, but it fails miserably (and I have no idea what she's talking about). Furthermore, there are little details that don't line up that drive me nuts. For example, the heroine and the hero share a steamy kiss on the stairs as she's heading to her rooms. Shortly thereafter, bathed and dress, she come down the hallway from her room (which is on the first floor)...um....OK.As a lover of romance, I have to say that this one is weak. There's simply not enough backstory and not enough depth."
0, Very Unhappy: This was advertised as Vol. 1 and 2. I only received Vol. 1. I haven't located the proper way to contact somebody about this problem.
1," 30 years too late..: This is an excellent, well-written book. It is written by a woman - which is progress for the Catholic Church, who have rarely let women speak on serious theological matters. But that is the only progress I can see. The same issues are being discussed, the same problems addressed, as were the questions which pushed me out of a Catholic seminary over 35 years ago. No progress, either theological or sociological, seems to have been made on the issues of birth control, or women in the clergy, or married priests, etc. The Catholic Church no doubt would see this as a positive characteristic, but the rest of the world has moved on -- and taken a lot of the Catholic faithful with them.This is a good book. It's a shame that it could have been written almost word for word in the ""60's."
0," Doorstop: Lacking any serious depth even for beginners, and a complete waste of 900 perfectly good pages worth of paper. What a mess!"
0," BAD GIRLS BAD READ: I read Bad Girls of the Bible. I had high hopes for this book and was very anxious to read it. It started out as a slow read for me, which made it hard for me to stay engaged in the reading. I assumed it would parallel women of the bible with the women of today; the qualities and characteristics we share today with the women then. I assumed it would pull lessons from back then and bring them into today's real world of women. I assumed the lessons would teach us about faith, commitment, and love. I assumed this book would teach me to fight the good fight of faith, to overcome any obstacles in life by continuing in my faith walk, to believe God no matter what happens, and to develop more effectively in the fruit of the spirit. I assumed a lot about this book. I was highly disappointed! It took me over 2 months to read this book because I kept losing interest. I don't consider myself a bad girl, but this was indeed a bad read!"
1," This is one of my favorite books: I read The Bourne Identity back when it was first published and I reread it every few years. Ludlum's plots are tightly woven and the characters are admirable but flawed. I really enjoyed it on my Kindle. It is a favorite because of the suspense Ludlum builds. It is a good thriller. It is also a mystery and one of the few I could not figure out until the middle of the book. Since I usually throw mysteries away in the first few chapters because I solved the mystery, this is high praise, indeed."

0, Wrinkle Free Forever: The 5-Minute 5-Week Dermatologist's Program: Buyer beware!!! This is just a written sales pitch for the doctor's expensive products. I felt tricked. It was a waste of money and I was very disappointed.
0," stuck with it!: well. this is more like a complaint ,because i never got to use this item because it was not compatible with my camera and the seller in their infinite wisdom decided not to replace said item because the package was open .c,mon man dont be like that,you might get me once but you can be sure I will never buy anything else from you ever again .it was only $22.00 and for such little amout you show the people what kind of bussines you are running What happened to the customer is always right?"
1," wake of the flood: Wake of the flood, suprisingly a little know album this effort by the dead is almost at the level of the Mars Hotel album, if you enjoy early seventies dead you will love this, i highly recomend this along with Without a Net and From the Mars Hotel....can't you see that you are the sun that the morning brings....Liz, kate, jordyn, are my freinds"
0," worst publisher in the world: in fifty years of reading books in several languages, i have never seen a book so poorly prepared. there is not a single page without a typo, misspelling, wrong font, bad punctuation... some pages have as many as ten mistakes. clearly no one at the publisher read the book. apparently no one really cared. it's absolutely awful. don't buy this edition."
1," Master of the Universe: Sherman McCoy, a 39 year-old white Wall Street bond salesman, self described ""Master of the Universe"" lives on Park Avenue, he is married with a daughter and is a member of high society. He also has a hot chick on-the-side Maria. On their way home one Tuesday night they make a wrong turn and end up in an abandoned seedy side of the Bronx. Two black guys walking down the street offer their assistance ""Hey buddy, you need some help?"", Sherman and Maria sure they're being set-up, panic and end up bumping into one of them with Sherman's Mercedes and then speed away without reporting it. It all blows up when one of the black guys turns out to be severely injured and the press, police and the mayor get involved in political issues involving race and class. The writing is so great that even in 2010 a story that was written 20 years ago still seems fresh and relevant. Kudos big time!"
1," Bosom Friends Forever: My friend and I were so inspired by the movie we now call each other anne shirley and diana, we are bosom friends. I love the music. It is so romanticlly preformed by all. I don't think I could live without the movie. If you have seen the movie more than once. You will sit there and listen to the music and remember what was happening in the movie. I feel highly about the movie and the soundtrack."

1," Nice addition for fans: I purchased the clock for a friend, and she enjoyed it. My only concern was the clock came slightly damaged. The hands were unattached and moving freely around the box. But they popped back on fairly easily. I haven't been told of any other problems with it."
0, Brittle: The black pieces on this were very brittle and did not hold up to any kind of chewing from our english bulldogs at all.
1, Terrific movie!: Love this movie! Lots of storylines which tie together nicely. I've recommended it to all of my friends. I thought it was great casting and writing.
0," Lint Factory: I should have read the reviews before I bought this chamois. After washing my car and drying the car with this chamois. There was noticeable lint all over the car. What use is this product if there is lint all over the car. You can not buff the car or wax the car with all the lint this thing leaves behind. I had to end up washing the car again to get all the link off. I just paid for an expensive grease rag. If you have money to burn or throw away, buy this POS. Better yet if you want to throw away your money, just give it to me."
1," Works Great, Melting Pot at home at a fraction of the cost!!!!: Went online and found recipes for my favorites and made them at home in livingroom. Dinner was awesome."
1, Product and delivery review: Good product at the right price and reached in time. Works well. Easy to operate. Aesthrtically appealing product. The product meets my need.
0, Stupid movie ~ don't waste your time: We watched this due to the high review ratings and kept waiting for it to get better. It never did. The characters were not believable and the storyline was lacking.
1, Good book.: Good book with great pictures.Very good information and at a good price.I recommend it!A must if you are traveling to the Galapagos.
0," No Scientific Information Provided: What a waste of money! Both PBS and Ms.Morissette should be ashamed of this product as it has absolutely no scientific evidence to support her position that CO2 is connected with global warming. She presents no facts and provides no scientific evidence. This whole DVD can be summarized into the basic concept-that if you raise the temperature of the atmosphere enough, the polar ice caps will melt! That conclusion goes without saying and is equivalent to concluding that increasing one's thermostat will result in warming the temperature in their house. This `Documentary' would have a lot more value if Ms. Morissette provided some evidence, or provided facts of a cause and effect relationship.I would recommend the DVD, the Great Global Warming Swindle, as this author actually provides scientific data from an objective point of view which is supported by facts"
1," Great supplemental story to the comics: Really great novel. Not necessary to read the series, but will add to the enjoyment of both as they both reference specific events occurring at the same time in both. The ending climax was especially great."
0," And Then There Were Two??: Doesn't have quite the same ring, does it?After calling every video shop in town and not being able to find this, I ordered it from ..., and impatiently waited two weeks for my delivery. When it finally came, I ran inside, turned the lights off, watched it and... felt thoroughly cheated.Its not that its a bad movie; if I hadn't read the book I guess I would've enjoyed it. But changing the end they did totally ruined for it me. This is not the way it was supposed to be."
0, ordered 2 months ago and still have not received one issue: Ordered two months ago and still have not received a issue yet. Wonder if I will? Did not take two months for the bill to come? Wow!
0," Not for the explorer: I saw this item for my 14 month old son and thought that it looked fun, safe and convient. When I went to use it my son kept putting his face in the water and choking. Even though this item shows it folds up after each use and just springs open for the next use, you still have to blow it up some and deflate it before you fold it up. If you little one is a explorer or just likes to copy the grown-ups this toy is not for them at all(I personally think this toy should be taken off the market) stick to the cute inflatable baby boats."
0," Tainted with lead!!!!!!!: Not only is this product a piece of crap, it specifically gives a warning to wash your hands after using b/c the cords are full of lead!! Who is regulating this stuff?!!"
0," Newbie Vegan: I knew giving up animal products was the right thing to do, but after reading ""Becoming Vegan,"" I got the impression that it would have to be a long, gradual process, as (according to page v of the book) one of the co-authors is not yet vegan herself.If you're looking for the motivation to become vegan, I urge you to listen to Bruce Friedrich's compelling essay ""Veganism in a Nutshell"" (for free) at http://www.brucefriedrich.org/. I started and completed my transition to veganism during that hour-long reading.Perhaps ""Becoming Vegan"" is a good starters guide for already-vegans, but it's not much in the way of inspiration."
1," wings of azrael: It's a very good EP. I noticed that ""Auburn Road"" and ""Ceramic"" really stand out from the rest of the songs. For only $7, you get tempo variation, great screaming and melody that everyone will enjoy. I can see that This Day Forward influenced the band a little but you can cross Coheed & Cambria & Atreyu in the EP description. It is very good, I suggest you to buy this."
1," Getting tired? Put this DVD on!: If you're getting too tired or discouraged to reach your dreams, plop this movie in for some inspiration. You'll have no excuse after seeing this movie. Take that huge seemingly insurmountable dream and break it up into bite-size manageable goals and you'll get there."
1," For someone who hasn't been working out in a while...Great Start!!: I found that this product was wonderful! I had been sick for a while and getting back into excercising was hard. My motivation wasn't there and everthing out there wanted to you to jump buildings it seemed to get you back into shape. I found this was totally opposite. I received a nice workout, stayed motivated and was pouring in sweat by the time I got to the mat work. Especially on level 2. I bought the whole series (Abs and Buns, thighs and arms) those two dvds are also phenomenal! Buy all four and rotate them. You won't regret it. Honestly, I can say that I see a difference in how my clothes fit. My waist uses to be tight and uncomfortable in my clothes and now I have about two inches and I have only been doing this four to five times a week and I am on my third week. Be mindful that good eating habits are also required in order to see results!"
0," Too much and too little.: This was the book used by my college Greek course (back in 1985). The general consensus among my classmates at the time was that this book was too complicated for beginners (especially those who weren't of Greek orgin), and too simple for those who were considered intermediate students.Those who never spoke Greek would have fared better if there was some mention of the relationship of Greek-rooted American words to make the vocabulary a little more digestible.For someone like me, who grew up in a Greek household (but never attended Greek school or formally educated in the Greek language), the book was a bore. And, I my command of the language was the same coming out as it was going in.I have given the book (yes I still have it) to my brother-in-law, who has a degree in Linguistics and is fluent in several languages. He can't seem to use it either. Perhaps this book should have been taught on a junior-high level."
1," Heartbreaking: It was difficult to tear myself away from this book. Even when I was at work, the author's humility and convictions stayed with me. I have seen the affects of child abuse and molestation in my career as an RN, but I've never read such a candid and real book about the personal sacrifices of the noble officers that investigate these cases. The book is chilling and sad, but at the same time so exciting that it was over too soon. The author offers hope through the most terrible conditions."
0," Yuck.: An extremely disappointing sequel to a promising 1st novel. Reign of Shadows looked like it would become a series of at least decent quality, but suddenly dropped by the 2nd novel. I thought, what the hell, it'll still be good for nice bouts of mindless reading. Nope."
1," What are some of you thinking?!: ""My Brother the Cow"" is a great album. Going back to their roots, Mudhoney gets their old producer Jack Endino, who i might add is amazing, and delivers an all out expolsive album. One of the best CDs released in 1995. With their post punk tracks like Judgement, Rage, Retribution and Thyme, their tracks like FDK and their bluesy tracks like In My Finest Suit, Mudhoney shows us the range they have. This is probasbly the last great album of that whole ""grunge"" thing."
1," Completely Unexpected...and Amazingly True: I'm going to be careful and try not to give spoilers out for this book.First off, WOW!!! I honestly loved the book. It was quite dark compared to the other ones and I had to get used to it...the lightheartedness was definitely gone (which is to be expected) but I enjoyed it nonetheless and I feel any avid Harry Potter fan will feel Harry's emotions (so well described by Rowling) are deserved.Again, Rowling brings up good points throughout the story (including the house-elves' viewpoints on being set free). Also, as many of you will know, a prominent character dies which I feel will be important to character development in the next two stories. She also brings up good points involving death...Definitely a must read for any avid Harry Potter fan, with points that reach all ages.Congratulations, J.K. Rowling!"
0," Didn't recieve: I ordered this book in November of 2009 and it is now February 2010 and I have not received the book, please look into it for me, thank you Ellen"
1," Robert Hanssen, SPY: I found this book to be very well written. It gives a lot of detail without bogging you down in the dirty underworld of the FBI/CIA. Would recommend it to anyone interested in real life espionage."
0," Unauthorized charge on my credit card to renew unwanted subscription: I bought a 1-year subscription through their website to try it out. After a year, I did not have any intention of renewing, but they kept sending me magazines. So I just waited for it to run out. After the 2nd year, I found a charge of $18 on my credit card. I called and asked them to refund it promptly. They told me they had me on a continuous subscription. Poor business practice, as I did not receive any notification of my credit card being charged, nor did I elect for this option."
1," Great Book: Unlike the reader who found this book shallow, I found it really helpful in every way. Perhaps the shallowness was in the reader, not the book. I found this book really heped me to make sense of my experience with loss, and understand what I was going through. The lessons learned from the book - actually, what the book helped me learn about myself - have helped me grow and I continue to use and think about the things I've learned about myself and the loss of someone close to me. The book is as good as it gets when it comes to helping. Thanks to the author!"
1," Me Time: Whenever it's cold outside and you want to curl up with some good food and a good movie, this is the one that will warm you up."
1," great deal. better than expected.: After reading some reviews I was worried that this kennel would be flimsy and unsecure. After reading other reviews this seemed like an average to above average kennel at a great price. Good news! The good reviews were actually correct. Out of the box it's easy to set up. It snapped together well and didn't need any additional support like zip-ties, as some people have mentioned. It turned out larger than I had pictured so now both my dogs, a beagle and pitbull, snuggle together in it and even hang out inside it when it's not time to ""kennel up."""
0," Does Not Hold Shape: Bought this little cooler for the back of our ATW wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc. Cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well, but this a totally soft-sided cooler with no frame or supports, so if there is anything in it, the cooler does not hold it's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon. Looks terrible and I would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or something"
1," Fascinating Narrative of Ambiguity: Rarely have I been as taken (read impressed) with a book, such as I was with 'mbiguity."" It is long, but I prefer long books to short ones and this is a complex story of the same circumstances as viewed by seven people affected by the actions of others. Each chapter is told by a different participant. What I particularly liked was that the author did not reveal who was telling his or her version of events, but rather let you figure it out as you went along (i.e. ""Oh, that's Angel talking"") It was fascinating to read the same events viewed by different people. It also contained good life lessons, increased my vocabulary and had a believable and fine ending. Good job, Mr. Perlman!"
1," I'm Sorry, So Sorry, I'm sorry I Didn't Buy This Earlier: Finally Woken is a sensational album even more so because it is so unique. I heard the song They on the TV and wondered if the whole album would be as good at that song of if the rest like so many artists these days would be fillers. I was pleasantly surprised to discover Finally Woken has no fillers whatsoever on it. I can see music from this album not just playing on many people's stereos or computers but appearing in the soundtracks of many future movies as well. If Jem can keep up the high standard for future albums there's no telling how big she will be. Lyrics are included in the cover insert as well. Sensational highly unique album, just buy it!"
1," Very good installment: I usually don't expect much in sequels or additional installments in series. Mostly the first book is the strongest, but I have to say I really like how all the elements were amped up in this one. There was a little more to the odd relationship between Dresden and Murphy, lots more action, and some good twists. Looking forward to reading more!"
0," Utter garbage: This book is utter nonsense. An ""Internet tax""? Uh huh. And MSN Hotmail is about to shut down, too. Just forward this e-mail to 10 people and you can prevent losing your e-mail account.It's about time that the United States started obeying international law, rather than coming up with random books that pretend this is a ""subversion"" of its freedoms"
1," wow...: This is truly one of the best books I've ever read (and I've read a lot!). I'm not a highly emotional person, but this book had me crying, laughing and raging as I went from chapter to chapter. The relationships between the characters are so well developed that I feel as though I know them as my own acquaintances, or maybe even friends. If you appreciate stories that involve romantic love, parental love, and love among friends, I would highly recommend this book to you."

0," Abridged audioCD was unacceptable: In this abridged audio version, the story line became disjointed. The clues tocharacters and plot, and the setup for sudden puns and allusions that make Terry Pratchett booksastonishing were wiped out of context. Also, I was disappointed that the reader didn't use a range of voices and accents. The experience was like eating dry toast.I returned this product and bought the book. I am a HUGE Terry Pratchett fan."
1," Nice Part: This is a nice part, It is easy install and looks great on my old truck. I Would buy items from this manufacturer again."
1," Bliss: The talented Mr. Groban has managed to produce another collection of beautiful music. It's rare for music to move me to tears, but some of his songs did it. I especially loved ""When You Say You Love Me"" and ""All' Improvviso Amore"", but the entire CD is wonderful. I highly recommend it."
0," Interesting but limited: Despite many facts updating Thomas Verny's The Secret Life of the Unborn Child, an expectant parent finishes this book saying,""So what?"" All the data does really not provide a useful direction for its evidence that the fetus is capable of learning. However, I found that my two children vastly benefitted from the prenatal enrichment system described by Dr. Sarah Brewer in her recent book, Super Baby, with its compelling documentation for the product called BabyPlus (see [...]), which as a nurse I would urge that parents-to-be consider."
1," A wonderful tangle of stories not to be missed: Other Fish in the Sea not only brings back memories of my 20's but the journey involved in discovering contentment and possibly the love of our life.I love the creative way author Lisa Kusel incorporates a series of short stories all interconnected with one character, a young woman who experiences the anguish of love, heartache, and pain. Kusel's writing suggests the possibilities of affecting the lives of those around us, even in situations where we're merely bystanders or have no personal or frequent contact with that individual.Kusel is a talented and up and coming author. Her humor, attention to detail, and insight into the grooves of relationships is remarkable. I recommend this book to all of the hopeless romantics and look forward to reading her future novels. It's a great read. You won't be dissapointed."
0," take another Book.: not good enough, still have typo and did not explain some term (i.e. 1NF, 2NF) I will recommand Ramez Elmasri's Fundamentals of Database systems"
0, Zero stars!: I was really hopeful this product would work so I ignored the bad reviews and bought it. I was a fool. Everyone is absolutely right the battery only lasts 5 minutes despite following the charging instructions to the T. I am returning this product and will spend my money on a better brand. I am very disappointed!
0," Snoooze: This movie was mildly entertaining but only toward the end with the motorcycle sequences. The plot--such as it was--was disjointed and hardly made sense. Heck, I disliked this movie so much, that I'm not going to comment on it further other than to say that it wasn't worth the cost to view it."
0," Boring!!!: It is hard to imagine how sex of every description and violence of every sort could be boring, but without feeling, a focused story line, and decent acting, that is exactly what happens in Caligula. I was titilated by the thoughts of what might happen in this movie, but my imaginings were much more exciting than the reality of the film. Buy yourself a good book instead!"

0," Boring, Boring, Boring: Two guys, one plain-looking (Thomas Haden Church) and one ugly (Paul Giamatti) run around California on a wine tasting road trip. Paul Giamatti is a middle school teacher who buys Barely Legal magazine and then lies on his bed ogling young girls. Ick! The girls in that magazine are posed to look like they are the age of his students. What a lecher, especially considering all the teacher/student scandals in the news. The only funny part is when the actress Sandra Oh clobbers Thomas Haden Church with her motorcycle helmet because he deserved it."
1, Great Product! 98 Blazer handles much better: This product was a replacement of the originals on my 98 Blazer 4x4. The old ones just rust and fell off.Took some time to get the remaining links off but then the real problem hit. On the Blazer the sway bar and control arm need to be compressed together to get the nut on. I had to use a long flat head wedged in the rim of the wheel and a jack to push up from the bottom to get the nut on. Really took only an hour more.Once the Moog kit was on work 100% better than stock.
1," Review of The Dead Season: I thought this was a very interesting book. As far as Casefiles go, it was ok. It was however a little different then some of the other casefiles. Surprise ending, and theme of the 20's. Very good."
1," just what i needed: I use these shoes for Tai Chi. They are superior to other shoes I have worn for this purpose. They are a bit narrow, so watch out if you have wide feet. Also, I'm usually size 9, but these are almost too short. I maybe should have gone for the 9 1/2."
0," Ugh.: I was already desperate and in trouble when I bought this book -- I should have known better. Monologue books are awful, generally speaking, and I should be taking the time to read plays to find my monologues. Nevertheless, I was lazy and had an audition coming up so I purchased this book used.Man, what a let down. First off -- the book is from 1987. Nineteen hundred and eighty-seven. This book is almost 23 years old. The plays in this book are mostly from the 1970s and early 1980s. What does that mean for you, the actor? That you're going to be doing old-ass monologues that every casting person has heard at least 23948237717220001 times. That's a looooot of Christopher Durang.There's also numerous errors in the index of the book that make finding the monologue you want very difficult. In short -- this book is an antiquated waste, and if you're doing monologues from this book, you're probably in big trouble."
1," Superb, Highly Recomended: Oeverall the production is superb. Evelyn Hart is one of the most beautiful dancers. Her classical line were beautiful, she made the dance alive. Her Odette alone makes this DVD a must buy."
1," Except ye repent,. . .: Sadly, we live in an age where everyone does what is right in his own eyes; An age where there is no distinguishable difference between the Church and the unbelieving world. Too many ""Christians"" today want to be saved ""in their sins"" not ""from their sins"". But Jesus said, ""... except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."" There must be a change of heart. There must be a turning away from all sin. This book addresses an issue that is not heard from the pulpits of today's churches nearly as often as it should be. This book speaks not only of what true repentance is but also the importance of genuine sorrow over sin. Every believer in Christ should read this book."

1," The Whole Shebang Very Very Good: Muy Bueno, El Primero de su Carrera y si las criticas no dañan la imagen al tratar de catalogarlas como imitadoras de las Dixie Chics los éxitos serán grandes.Recomiendo todo el CD, pero en especial la pista #6 Still Holding Out For You."
0," It's time to stop reprinting this old translation: Sheridan made a brave attempt some 25 years ago to render Lacan's difficult prose into English, but Sheridan's command of French left a great deal to be desired, and his knowledge of Lacan's numerous seminars (that form the backdrop of most of his writings) was non-existent; after all, almost none of them were available even in French at that time. This old translation should no longer be reprinted: it is virtually incomprehensible at times and is often quite inaccurate. Readers seeking to study the Ecrits should consult the 2002 translation by myself; the paperback version will be out very shortly, will be competitive in price with this old translation, and is vastly superior in readability and accurary."
0," Not reliable: Very cheap product, only worked properly for about a few weeks. Very short battery life and the unit stopped moving around after 2 weeks. I kept the alarm on the floor, so there was no reason for it to stop moving around on it's own."

1," OMG almost too awesome for words but I have some anyway (Claire 12): It was like stepping off a cliff, langing on a train, and zipping away on The Merchant of Death's speedy plot. I am so glad I checked out the only copy at my school library, if I hadn't I would not have experienced one of the best paper and ink thrill rides of my life. I love this series and recommend it to anyone looking for something exhilarating (spelling?)."
0," Not as advertised: I also received a mattress that did not have a recessed pump or repair kit, was not in ""like-new"" condition, and a ""manual"" that stated there was no warranty. I advised Amazon and they provided for return of that mattress and shipped a replacement. The replacement is exactly the same. I emailed them again and received this reply: ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."""
1," Works as advertised: Since I live in a small condo, I wanted a quiet, compact exercise bike. This one is exactly what I was looking for, and I've been very pleased with it. The assembly instructions can be a little goofy, but it wasn't hard to figure out the intent and I had it up and running in very short order. The seat is pretty uncomfortable, but that's my only gripe."
0," Sengoku CV-2230: I have had a Kerosun kerosene heater for 20 years. I assumed that this heater would perform equally, however it has a smell unlike any kerosene heater I've ever had. I have followed the instructions closely including ""dry burning"" without eliminating the fume smell."
0," Surprised and disappointed: This was the first time I ordered a used home school workbook on Amazon and it will be the last. When it was listed as in ""good condition"" I wasn't expecting it to be written in - a lot ! Why would I want a workbook that was 1/3 filled in ? Having home schooled for 24 years and purchased used books whenever possible, I was surprised and disappointed. This is my first unsatisfactory used purchase from Amazon. I incorrectly assumed this workbook would have very little writing in it because it was not a good fit for the student or teacher, making it nonreturnable but useable. I felt the seller was deceitful by not disclosing the amount of filled in units. So,I ordered a new book from the publisher so I knew what I was getting and can start in the beginning.

0," Dont waste your money.........: We got baby's Quiet Sounds Video monitor last week as a gift and i was excited abt it specially after reading all the 5 star reviews of this product. When we tried it out the picture was shaky and not so clear. Also, it was impossible to slightly increase the volume (due to high pitched static) even after unplugging all wireless and turning off everything.It is certainly not suitable for an apartment use, maybe it works better in bigger homes. We returned it immediately and got the Sony-27 channel audio monitor instead....and i have to say tht me and my husband are amazed by how crystal clear it is (with everything else in the house plugged in)....Sony has really given quality to their monitor."

0," Willa...: ...PLEASE, do we really need anymore of this white girl pop [junk]??! She really [stinks]!!! Her single ""I Wanna Be Bad"" may have a good beat to it (hey, Britney's songs have good beats too but at least she can dance!) but honestly, she's just hypocritical. She disses pop music and its participants when she's in the pop music scene herself and she's not doing too well herself either.Please don't buy this album. You'll be wasting your money."
1," Quick, Easy, & Fabulous!: I recently changed my eating lifestyle by adopting the Sugar Busters plan. This cookbook, Sugar Bust For Life (Part II) is the best cookbook I have ever purchased! The recipes are so simple, they do not require any ingredients that are impossible to find (unlike some low-fat and/or gourmet cookbooks), and every recipe that I have prepared tastes unbelieveably delicious. It is very difficult to come home after a long day of work and want to cook a meal, yet this cookbook offers an abundance of flavorful, fabulous, and fast meals that I actually look forward to making. Not only have I lost weight, but I feel much more energized than I ever have. Sugar Bust For Life is a part of my life now, and I know it will be...forever!"
0," Great, when brand new, went fuzzy after a month!: I got this cam for $22 about 2.5 years ago. It was great for its price. Most cams were $40 or $50 boasting only 15 fps. At first this cam had great detail, but after a month the picture changed. Now it is unbelievably fuzzy and is probably around 1 fps. The picture is grainy, blurry, and just terrible! Do not buy this camera, because it could break like mine did. Next time I buy a cam, I will pay the extra $20 in hopes of some longevity."
1," Quite funny actually: It's amazing actually how much truth these books have in them.They are written very tongue-in-cheek. Quite humorous, and clearly exaggerating conditions back then, but you can see many of the points actually in the present.Amusing read, with lots of action. Clear-cut heros and villains (if you're looking for a twist on who the good guy or bad guys is, this isn't your book). But, definitely get to see the world from two vantage points, and a clear descriptive account of how things are from these very different pair of eyes.Story is building up quickly at this point."
1, good wire: good wire. Strands are sturdy when working with it. They do not break off like cheaper wire does. Decent price for 100 feet.
1," low-moderate use: i don't ride my bike that often (around once a week for an hour at most, weaving through NYC traffic). haven't had any problems with the helmet (i don't even use the stickers that some of the other reviewers complain about - maybe i should :)overall, for low to moderate use i give it a thumbs up. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the price - maybe i could have picked up something cheaper, but not dissatisfied with the product itself."
1, a great gift: I sent this to my sis in law to help her get through the morning sickness! She got in quickly and it was in great condition. She was excited to read it.
0," BEST OF?: It is quite obvious that the Tubes best music came prior to thier selling out to sell records which was prior to the period this c.d reflects. I do not think I have heard a more derivative song than ""Talk To Ya Later"". Not much else here either and if you just have to have ""She's A Beauty"" it is available on just about any 80's compilation (unfortunately). Do yourself a favor and get the millineium collection which reflects the period prior to this."
1," Perfect Coffee!: I love this coffee press. It makes the same high quality coffee as the classic Bodum press, but removes the risk of coming in contact with the hot beaker or metal, and is less subject to breakage. Combine this with a sack of good coffee beans, an electric grinder, and a good electric teakettle, and enjoy."
0," focuses on tactics, not strategy: I am an advanced excel user who did not gain much from reading this book.I have the following issues with the book -1. There is not enough information on good layout design or designing spreadsheets to minimize errors or mistakes.2. It doesn't discuss why people are making particular errors or in what context errors are being made. Sure I can look out for issue x, y, or z, but in what situations would those issues come up in the first place?3. There are some points that are very obvious and other points that people will never use.Again, I did not learn much if anything from reading this book. It may be good for the beginner, but not for the advanced user."
0, Bits of Interesting Info but overall poor: Here is a book that I wanted to like... but I can't. Certainly there is somoe areas of the book that offer an interesting insight into the history of donut's but its written so poorly its hard to read. This book would have benefited by a good editor. I have picked this up 3 or 4 times since I purchased the book - its simply a bad read.
1," A must read for seekers of wisdom and truths.: I read all the ""Rampa"" books back in the 1980's in their orginal printings from England. I am so glad to find them again at Amazon! How wonderful to be able to read again that timeless message. If you enjoyed any of the Conversations with God or any new age, and I hate to use that term, you must read the orginal, new age. Words are not enough. If you are going on your personal journey of finding your own truths, include these books and good seeking."
0," quality control for Rosle Made In China is low: I love Rosle products and have bought many over the years. I enjoy the function and high quality control in manufacturing for most of their products. Recently, however, some 'made in china' Rosle products have had serious quality control issues. This item--Hook Fish Slice--is one that has issues.I returned my 'fish slice' the day after receiving it because I felt a rough, unfinished edge along the front. The brushed steel handle is also quite different from the (made in germany) handles (of which I have many) with the brushing being very course (instead of fine).I will continue to buy Rosle, even if they're made in China, but I'll return any and all that don't match the quality of made in germany items."
1, Just as good as it's competitors: I'm staying at an RV park as I write this and there's a Camping World next door. I compared the Camco vent I received from Amazon to the MaxxAir brand...and I couldn't tell much difference in quality. I'm glad I saved the money. You can also get these from Wally World...but not as cheaply as here. You can at least see the quality before buying if you don't believe the reviews! :)
1, WONDERFULL BUY !: THIS is the ultimate collection of WONDER WOMAN. If you like the tv show from the 70s this is your best purchase you will ever make.The picture quality is just great. I LOVE IT ! You will too.
0," If you knowm whats good for your face you won't get this: I'm plaing about that,but don't get this,the first 4 days it's cool with the walking,dancing,burping,and whisling, but thats basicly it.It's stupied.I rather get the raptor one."
0, fell apart in 1 week: The method of attaching the brush bristles to the base was poor. The glue cracked and the bristles fell off within 1 week.
1," Superb Batteries: I own a Panasonic GS500 (NTSC), I ordered a couple of these batteries from Digital Concepts and they work exactly as advertised. Running time is great, they work just fine with the original charger and are quite worth the $$Overall, had a lovely experience with them, no downsides that I recallhighly recommended"
0," Disturbing on so many levels: I watched this on ABC Family with my son instead of the DVD -- I imagine the DVD is better because you don't have a movie twice as long as it should be because half of the showtime is ads. Then again, the other half is dogs sitting there with animated mouths. Talking. And god help us, singing. The smaller dogs sing in high falsetto. Basically, a nightmare.The narrative consists of moments when, just when you think it can't get anymore saccharine, the singing dog gets noticed by people who, up till that point were having a glum Christmas, and then discover the singing dog and their lives because extremely happy."
1, how the Scots made America: very informative. the contributions to the Scots in America are incredible . the leadership they provided helped shape this country and make it the greatest nation in the world.
0," Waste of money: go to the nintendo site and they will give you 1 to 4 (you pick how many you want) wrist straps for free, the shippings just a little longer."
0, NEW MEST: I love Mest so I was stoaked and got the new one the first day it came out but I was so disappointed. This doesn't even sound like any of their old stuff and I LOVE their old stuff. Even thugh I have to admit its starting to grow on me and the first three songs are pretty good.
0, Unbelievable: I thought this book was awful. Louis Begley's decision not to use quotation marks in his character's dialogue made reading it a chore. His character development was superficial and his attempts to describe what motivated each character were obvious and ineffective. I didn't relate or sympathize with any character and found most of their actions implausible. The ending was ridiculously unbelievable. The only good thing was that the book is short. Hopefully the movie will be a vast improvement.
1, I LOVED this movie!: This movie was soooo cute. I would recommend this to anyone who loves romance/comedies. It was very touching and I'm sure many people can relate to the way Luna was feeling. It was great.
0," Run Away !!! Not Useable in todays' XP computers!!!: D-Links website made the DNS-120 sound like just what I needed and so did Amazon's product info, BUT, it never recognized my drives.I spent a total of three and a half hours on the tech line, in India, with three different levels of techs, only to be disconected before resolving the problem. If you buy this from Amazon.com and there is no shrink wrap, rest asurred, I reset the Admin password to the default!NO NTFS FORMATED HARD DRIVES SUPPORTED!!! It will not even ""read only"" my two USB hard drives."
0," Looking for step-by-step? This isn't it.: This book isn't nearly as methodical as the other ""Bible"" books. If you are a Photoshop beginner and want step-by-step instructions on how to create various effects, I'd tell you to look elsewhere. There are too many times you have to flip back to previous paragraphs or chapters and reference previous steps in order to continue with the present effect. Ever encounter the ""then a miracle occurs"" gap? There are plenty in this book. Too bad, because I usually like Deke's books."
1," I'm no audio tech head, but these bad boys sound REAL nice: The only reason I'm not giving a 5-star review is because the bass seems to be a bit lighter than I'd have preferred. It's worth noting that I've only put about 10 hours of burn-in time, and I understand that these will sound better after more use, so maybe I'll be happier with the bass output later.Otherwise, these cans sound absolutely fantastic, especially if used for home theater and gaming. It's true that there is no insulation and all sound leaks out, but it's hardly going to wake anyone sleeping in another room, and the trade-off for spatial sound is well worth it. Ambient and environmental audio seems to actually come from different directions instead of all being inside your head. That, coupled with the oh-so-comfortable velour padding gives the illusion that you're not even wearing headphones.Add in the amazing value, and you have some very-near audophile quality cans at a great price. Highly recommended."
1," A definite break from the NORM!!!!!: This is definitately a break from all the mainstream music out right now. It may not be understandable for those who thrive on the radio mayhem. I became a Tricky fanatic ever since i was looking on the internet for a Bjork song featuring Kelis the Oceania Remix.Then i noticed an artist named Tricky among all the downloads. Out of curiousity i downloaded some songs from him, and ever since then i have bought all of his cds. I bought all except JUXTAPOSE,AND PRE MILLENIUM TENSION.This is some of the best songs ive heard because they are so different, and they are not as easy to understand. This makes the listener sit there and brainstorm. And buy a couple of listenings you start to enjoy this. I can also identify with Tricky, someone who doesnt fit into a certain group because of different musical ideas.SO anway for those people who like adventurous,somewhat dark but not to me,mind boggling music you should definately buy Tricky cds."
1," Excellent player: I just got my DVD 47 after buying a flat screen TV, so i needed a player with HDMI upconverting capacity. I owned a DVD 22 and it was great, but I wanted better definition. The quality is just great, and movies now sound even better - which I was not truthfully expecting. I'm delighted with my system.For the price,looks and specs I will def recommend it"
1," WESTING GAME IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE SEEN IT ALL.: The westing game is an amazing, action packed book that will keep you turning the pages. A mix of pink panther and Nancy drew, it tells the story of a man who mysteriously dies. In his will, he offers his mansion to the 1 out of 16 inheritant can find who killed him. Who will win? The girl who is a smarty. The young track star. Or the chef. Nonstop action the whole way through. And you think you've seen it all.jackson x"
0," Not for people who want to shape up: I've done yoga tapes where the emphasis is on toning up while you find...peace...but this really isn't, especially the A.M. tape. I think if you want to tone up, try a different tape, but if you just want to be a calmer person, then go with this one."
0," If you like to hear bass these aren't the earphones for you....: The earphones were ok. The noise cancelling was good but the sound of my music wasn't so great in these headphones. Before I had ear buds by Sony which were great but when I workout they tend to slip out. I thought getting these would be better plus cancel out all of the noise around. They actually were worse than my Sony ear buds. If you are someone that doesn't care about the sound of music and mainly need it for travel, it would be great for you. I just expected more out of them."
0," Never ever buy!: It's absolutely awful! It burns everything you put in it. The lid doesn't come close to sealing, and it rattles and allows steam to escape, resulting in sauces drying out instead of ""juicing up"" as they should. I literally had chicken turn to charcoal when I left it on for 5 hours on low. I would not give this product a zero. I would not want this thing even for free! Don't buy! You will be disappointed!"
1," Koyaanisqatsi-lite: If you loved the cinematography of the ""qatsi"" trilogy, then you'll love Chronos. These are essentially ""outtakes"" or similar visualizations by the cinematographer of Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, and Naqoyqatsi. It's the first thing Ron Fricke did after the Koyaanisqatsi film and it feels a bit of a ""leftover,"" especially because Chronos is only 43 minutes long. I think Baraka was more fully conceived. So I took a star off my rating of Chronos. That said, I still thoroughly enjoy his work and love seeing the stuff that ""didn't make the cut"" the first time around. The transfer looks good."
0, dumb: This was one of the biggest wastes of time.... The lead character was pretty cool but the infected were dumb and the story line was suuuper predictable. Thanks but no thanks.
1," I am loving Lily Bard: I love Charlaine Harris. I'll read anything that she writes. Lily Bard is my 3rd CH series that I've gotten addicted to. This is book 4 in the series and it's been my least favorite. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't the most exciting. It was reflection time for Lily as she is making a transition in her life. At times I felt like I was just reading Lily's reflection on the mystery or how she related events going on around her back to her own life. There wasn't enough dialogue between other supporting characters in my opinion. And for those readers who are familiar with Charlain's work know that she likes lots of characters. Sometimes I have a hard time keeping up with who is who. I'm looking forward to the fifth and final installment in the series. If you are into Lily, definitely check out Harper Connelly series and of course I recommend Sookie Stackhouse to everyone I know. I am going to give Aurora Teagarden a shot next."
0," One of the worst products on the market: Save you money and buy a real cheap computer. The device hangs when you copy a bunch of files to it and rarely works when you try to access it. And don't bother to call D-Link support about this product, because no one over there even knows how this product works."
0, Don't buy this product: This is the worst product for yeast infections. It will burn your insides. My ob-gyn confirmed they have heard a lot of negative feedback from their patients.
0," Smug parenting: I read this book expecting to love it -- I am beginning to unschool my daughter, and I'm eager to hear about other people's experiences. I also agree with most of the author's parenting philosophy, and believe that her daughter turned out to be a wonderful, happy person. Yet the tone of this book is annoyingly self-righteous and strangely narrow-minded. There is no room in the author's view for the validity of other parents' choices for their children; in her opinion, if they persue more traditional paths of raising kids, they are just plain wrong. I was disappointed. The book is also unfortunately poorly edited, with many basic grammatical errors. I am still all for the philosophy behind Ms. Fitzenreiter's book, but I wish it had been written with a more open-minded spirit and more skillfully."
0," Not as good as Leslie's other videos: I bought this dvd collection as a follow-up to the 2 mile walk, which I love. I wasn't impressed with the workout at all. #1 tape is for beginners so I didn't even try it. #2 was the High Calorie Burn. The steps were boring and she didn't do counts of 8, as she usually does. It just seemed like this dvd was thrown together. The banter between the exercisers was awful and distracting. The music wasn't loud enough and Leslie looked horrible. The use of the weights seems un-thought-out and just thrown in. I love Leslie Sansone, what happened with this DVD?"
1," Nice, roomy atmospher music. Girly- guys hate it: I like the tunes. Makes ya wanta ""groove"" some songs and write bad poetry others. All males so far within listening distance either try to turn it off, change it out, or ""be back when that crap has ended""..sheesh! Guys! What I don't like is that I like these tunes so much I can't sleep for hearing them replayed in my head.. Over and Over..and over within two days of hearing the tunes."
1, I loved it: Once finished I couldn't quit thinking about the story. Haunted and captivated me from beginning to end.
1," Very down-to-earth advice for step-mothers: This book was an excellent overview for a new step-mom. It has delightful and poignant life-experiences from real step-moms and even biological fathers. Mostly, it lets you know that you are not alone in your feelings for your step-child, even if those feelings are negative. Allows you to see yourself as part of a community, rather than alone in the world and in this particular situation. Helps you to focus on what is important and advises you to let go of the rest. Excellent chapters on focusing on your marriage, how to handle vacations with the step-children, dealing with your husband's ex-wife, and when to get help. All in all, a very fine book."
1, Excellent Product: Arrived quickly. Easy set up. I disagree with reviewers who thought it seemed cheaply made. This thing is solid. Most seeds germinated very quickly.
0," Not a fan of this airplane.: I thought my sons would love this video but it really was not very good. Both of my boys, who are six and three, were bored from the start. And the songs annoyed me. I'd reccomend Thomas or Veggie Tales instead of spending my money on this."
1, Great for wedding: I bought this when i decided to marry my girl. this is really excellent. we have passed out first marriage anniversary and she wear the ring everyday. i see the brightness of the diamond is as it was when i bought it.
0," Major Disappointment: I've been using Norelcos for years and they always gave a great shave UNTIL this model. The speed of the shaver is audibly slower than all previous models. This makes for a far more uncomfortable shave, pulling in places. I still have my previous model (8825) which gives a FAR more superior shave to this 9160XL. My blanket trust of Norelco is no longer there and I am suspicious of new models based on my great disappointment with this one. When I called Norelco to complain, the woman on the other end didn't seem too concerned and said I was stuck with it. It was a Christmas gift that I didn't start using until after the 30 day period had passed. 2 stars is the most I can give and even that's a stretch."
0," Interesting concepts wrapped in boring and bland: How is this book getting 5 star reviews? The characters are boring and unimaginative, and all apparently suffer from a total lack of believable emotional response. Supposedly abandoned base filled with hostile blue mutants? Meh. Life support crisis and serious threat of a slow, painful death? Yawn. Imminent inter-solar war with super mutants? Whatever. I've seen people get more worked up over lint.If this was ever made into a film it would be a $300 million dollar Michael Bay blockbuster with a cast made up of summer stock rejects. In fact even then I doubt you'd get performances wooden and drab enough.In short this is a few hours of my life I WANT BACK!"
0," I'll give you 50 bucks if you can figure out all the lyrics of Sugar, We're Goin Down just by listening to it: I'm a fourteen year old eighth grader and I guess this is the kind of music I'm supposed to be listening to. Ummmmmmmm.........no. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this album. I had Dance, Dance stuck in my head all day today, but all I could do was hum the tune because you can't tell what the guy is singing!! All I hear is ""Dance, dance, befonnhhmthremmndutyyhtremmm.... Dance dance, mmunhtuhhnngnkhhggthtnnfhtneenr....etc. Ugh... Are we sure this guy is even singing? Please DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! THE WHOLE THING IS A JOKE!!! Listen to someone good like Led Zeppelin or Green Day. Even Bowling For Soup is better than these fake, incomprehensible fools!!"
1, Learningn to Weave: Excellent book!! I am a total beginner at weaving and with the help of this bookI was able to warp my new loom and finish a project with no problems at all.I would highly recommend this to those new to weaving.
1," The classics, on your SNES!: It's great to see a game that can actually mix these two puzzle games from the NES. In Mixed Match, two players can compete in a race to get the most lines in Tetris (Type-A) after completing a stage of Tetris (Type-B) and a stage of Dr. Mario. Besides that, Tetris and Dr. Mario are two of the best of the classic puzzle games out there. It is great to be able to play them on the SNES if you missed out on your chance to get them while they were games for the NES."
1," buy this book...: This book is killer. Great stories, awesome photography, intelligent layout. Gibbons is the man....and he keeps getting stronger. ZZ Top's music just keeps getting better, he's probably the best bandleader in the history of rock."
0," Waste of time and money: The only reason I can see for buying this book is if you have a pirated version of the software with no manual. I know the Adobe manual well and I found nothing beyond what I knew already, except for a few ideas on how to use Adobe After Effects (which I would have expected in an After Effects Bible)."
0," Egh.....: Although Patterson has never been my favorite author, I have really enjoyed the previous books I've read from him, especially the new Lindsay Boxer ( I believe that's her name) series. Absolutely wonderful. But this book was very poorly written with bad dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a silly story line. This is something I would expect from a young writer just starting out, not one as seasoned as Patterson. Although he had the usual 2-3 page chapters (or less) it was absolutely dreadful getting to the end. Unless you're a compltely devoted Patterson fan, skip this one."
1," Okay, but not impressive: Theres nothing WRONG wit this game. But there are a couple of flaws. 1. NOT ENOUGH WRESTLERS 2.NOT ENOUGH MATCH TYPES 3.ACTION 2 SLOW 4. STUPID AI 5.THE CAW MODE WRESTLERS LOOK DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WRESTLERS. 6.ONLY 16 SPOTS 4 CAWs event hough XBOX HAS 50000 of free space. thats mainly it, the game has ppretty okay graphic, but sum wrestler like HHH is absolutely ugly. Another thing, the items you can put on your head looko like its glued on and the CAW boots SUX!!!! The game play is alrite, theres no career mode, but the belt is okay...overall is the first XBOX game, of course my expectations was high, but it is still playable."
1," Hilarious: Divas Don't Fake It and Princess in Training were both good and very entertaining. A lot of people can not relate to Jacqueline's character and I admit Xandra's character was more real because Jacqueline was a rich bratt, but each book was unique and a lot of fun to read."
1, Best 2006: This album has already been added to my best of 2006 list. Lovely lyrics matched with enchanting melodies; you will have no problem listening to this album from beginning to end. I highly recommend.
0," A big thumbs down compared to the original: Princess Diaries 2 will be such a bummer for those who loved Princess Diaries. Robert Schwartzman, as Michael in the first movie, will not returning to be in the sequel. So basically, the plot is now, that the first movie wasn't really like a fairy tale, true love doesn't exist. There will be a new guy playing a prince who Mia will fall in love with. I'm sorry, but that just ruins the first movie."
1," Fantastic Album: This is a great progressive rock album by a relatively unknown band from Canada. I wish I could find more of their work online, but alas, it is tough. I would definitely recommend this product."
0," Wouldn't pay $75 for it: I bought this because I made my own baby food, and needed something to it keep cool. It worked great for about the first month, then seemed to fall apart. The stitching came apart on one of the buckles on the shoulder straps; that ended up coming apart. And the seem came apart on the back of the back pack. I wasn't rough with it, and used it as a 'normal' baby bag. It seemed like it was made cheap, and not what I expected for a $75 product. The idea and the function of the back pack is great, but the quality is poor. I ended up returning it."
1," Feeling It All Over Again: The original soundtrack of Gladiator is far better than any other version from it. It is my first movie sound track I rushed to buy so soon. Just as good as Brave Heart.The same feelings I get when I watch the movie are the same feelings I get when I listen to the CD.The same strong chills strike me again and again when I hear my favorite track Now We Are Free because that is exactly how I feel when I here it. The songs dramatizes the different ways us humans feel in life. My over-all feelings of the cd is a peacefull awakness to this life. I only wish the albumncarried the lyrics, to the last two tracks especially."
0," Am I being Punked. Where's the camera?.: This is one of the worst marketing and sales books I have EVER read! This book is a joke, right?I'll take that back. If you know a 13 year old kid thinking of starting a lawn mowing or baby sitting business, then on second thought, this is a good book to read.For anyone over the age of 13, this is a cliche written piece of junk."
1," Instant performance upgrade!: This is by far the cheapest and most effective upgrade I have done on my car. The airflow improves drastically, so does the exhaust note! Increased my fuel economy by a couple of mpgs. I'm very pleased with this product, strongly recommend for young lads with used cars"
0, JACK NICHOLSON BIOGRAPHY: This was nothing near being a biography. It was just a book full of episodes in Jack N's life that were taken from various magazine/newspaper/media articles - things everyone already knew about him - nothing new or personal things about him - usually what a biography exposes. I found it very ho-hum.
1," Variable pattern, low noise: I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise, low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding, the sound of the mic simply disappears . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail, but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this more expensive functional competition."
0," $1 Per Loaf: Great machine. Quiet, strong motor, consisantly made good dough. But I got less than 100 loaves before the bushing in the bottom end of the bread pan wore out. (Thus $1 per loaf.) This would be easy to repair, but Breadman (Sulton) does not sell replacement parts. So I have a great machine that would still be baking bread if the bushing assembly in the lower part of the pan was sealed, or if I could purchase a busing housing assemby for $10 to $15. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS... NEVER PUT THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THIS BREAD PAN IN WATER WHEN CLEANING! Gary G. from Columbus, In."
1," flashbacks to club 47: I've stood in many a long cold line in front of Club 47 in Cambridge Mass in the winter of 1964 & 1965 just to watch these guys. They layed the foundation of my musical journey. I've owned all their albums which are now in really rough shape.I was thrilled to see this tape, for now they'll come back into my life after such a long time.......although I still occasionally wake up Geoff Muldour's Newport News or Whoa Mule drifting through my head.....thank you thank you thank you.....these guys are the VERY BEST"
1, Interesting!: Hi everyone! I think this is one of the most interesting books out there. How could the authur connect two different things together? the Zen and the computer systems analysis? Enjoy reading it!I rate it 5 stars :-)
1," Foray into pure metal: This album is TEHC's first full album plunging purely into metal. Very hard and grinding, this album falls more into the traditional black metal genre as opposed to the Industrial that TEHC has been previously known for. While many songs are skillfully crafted such as Bishop's Folly, it seems as if TEHC had an ax to grind with being called Industrial. (And as noted by things I've read.) However, as a metal album in itself, is very solid.I personally don't believe this album matches up to what TEHC could have produced, and I think Electronomicon comes out the stronger of the two of TEHC's more metal albums. I believe they learned from Witness the Millenium. Even so, a very good black metal album."
0," I HATE IT!!: I am very sorry. I really didn't know what I was buying, I thought it was shredded, but it was near powder.. I bought 24 pk. and trashed 23 31/64 pks. Worse purchase of my life. I'm sure more people like this product., than don't. I do however like the real beef jerky from Jack Link's, so that's what I'll buy."
1, Rubbermaid Rough 163 cubic feet storage shed: I am very happy with this rubbermaid shed. It was easy to put together and we had no problems as an edlerly couple. The shed was just what we needed to keep our electric motor carts dry and gardening supplies easy accessible. We love it and recommend this shed for it's quality and simplicity of assembly.
1," Excellent guide to Anglo society: As an obtuse Yank living in the UK, Debrett's Guide was a ""must have"" for navigating my way through English society. In a country where people pay close attention to seating order, thank you notes, and all of the other formalities of etiquette, Debrett's is the only way to survive with one's dignity.I don't think it is an essential in the US, as most of the etiquette is too obscure, so as to be irrelevent (i.e., what to wear at Royal Ascot)."
1," It's a brilliant film and a must have: Amazon does a good job of telling you what the film is about so I just tell what I thought of the film. It is has a brilliant cast and the acting is really good. The script is well written and is a terrific portrayol of a true story. It deserved all the awards it got and probably deserved more. A must buy, it will be worth it."
0," if it will play! :(: I have a toshiba DVD player and never could get this to play right, However my brother had a generic brand, and it played it fine! This is the only dvd I owned that did this (and I own a ton, including just about every rock DVD they have put out sofar)When I put it in mine, it had alot of lines in it.Anyway, I went watched it on my brothers DVD player and I thought there was way too much time killing on this and not enough music. Picture was sharp (on his DVD) sound was good, BUT the ""korn:live"" DVD is 10 x better!!!! way more material!"
1," JBL 10"" Subwoofer E150P: This Speaker seems to be no longer manufactured. As far as I can tell by the published specs. the JBL SUB 10 is its replacement. The grill is different. My E150P is well engineered and is very pleasing to listen to.In my listening room ( 16'x12' with vaulted ceiling ) which is not set up for surround sound, the E150p really brings out a symphonic bass drum or a 32Hz organ pedal. For under $200 I believe you will be satisfied."
1, Love these!: They cleaned my new George Foreman grill so easily! Absolutely love them! Will always keep them on hand! Must have if you own a George Foreman grill!
1," Beautiful, Beautiful Finlandia.: This is a Cassette. The one I have heard. AS a matter of fact, I likethe cassette rendition of Sibelius better than I do the CD. It isbeyond description. Magnificently beautiful."
0," Not a handbook: I would NOT recommend this book to any electrician, engineer, or architect. It is extremely difficult to comprehend. Gaining any practical information from this book is futile. I have had the twelfth edition over ten years. I used it to study for the electricians exam. I hated it then. Since that time, I have found it to be a very poor reference book. The thirteenth edition is no better. I understand why some electrician training schools might use this book - it is very comprehensive. It would make a good reference for a classroom lesson plan, but not a direct teaching tool. If you want to learn the material in this book, get the National Electric Code Handbook (and related materials published by the NFPA) and appropriate textbooks. FYI - I am a licensed electrician and a registered professional engineer."
1," Love It - Even with one tiny complaint: This monster is worth it: easy, very quick to assemble and disassemble, and not as loud as I thought it was going to be from the other reviews. The only thing I've found is that sometimes the waste is wetter than I expected it would be - I think this has something to do with how much power the juicer has. It's like it's going so fast sometimes that 1/3rd of a lemon will be shunted off into the waste before the machine can break it down further. Otherwise, I am a particular purchaser, and I'm thrilled. I would honestly buy this one again if I had to start all over, and anyone I've talked juicers to sees mine and compares it favorably to theirs or we find we have the same juicer. That's great."
0," What a dissappointment....: I was so happy to get our bubble spa! It was not out of the box 15 minutes, before we had to give it a try. As with the other reviews, it does not stick to your tub. Thought it was maybe my type of tub, but I see not. The clean up of the unit does take away from it's ability to relax, as stated by another reviewers. A great idea. But has a very long way to go. I will not return it...... but would not recommend it with it's present design."
0, An attempt to justify pedophilia by utilizing big words: The authors attempt to remove the stigma of certain pedophilia related actions by arguing that there is such a thing as consensual sex with minors. Trash.
0, Seriously?: I think I'll hold pencil manufacturers responsible for any bad grades I received in high school. Does anyone actually take these premises seriously?
0," See review for Upholding the Law: I wrote a lengthly review for another book like this... Upholding the Law. Please read before you follow this man's advise. Many have gone to jail thinking that this was all the right way to go. Whether he's right or wrong, I know people sitting in jail now with huge fines for tax evasion."
0," Astrology doesn't work: Astrology does not work, so a book purporting to explain how it does must be all wrong. Look instead at some of the excellent books that debunk this nonsense, like Science confronts the paranormal, ed. K. Frazier; The Gemini syndrome: a scientific evaluation of astrology, by Culver and Ianna; Pseudoscience and the paranormal, ed. T. Hines; and Paranormal borderlands of science, ed. K. Frazier, all published by Prometheus Books."
0," God awful.: I'm being forced to read this in my grade 12 English class; this would be helpful if you're about twelve, not in the twelfth grade."
0," Dumbed-Down and Disappointing...Wait for the movie: If we're to believe the bibliography, Timeline is one of the most extensively researched pieces of recent fiction. Unfortunately, the resulting product is disappointing...mediocre science fiction meets dumbed-down history. The characters are shallow clones of earlier Crichton protagonists, and the plot needs work...the last third of the book devolves into chasing-running-hiding-chasing-running-hiding-ad infinitum.For better science fiction, read anything by Azimov. For a more vivid image of the Middle Ages, read The name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco. As Eco has said, publishers underestimate the intelligence of readers. Maybe overzealous editing caused this book to be such a shallow example of the kind of work that Crichton is obviously capable of doing."
1," Rainbow Six - The best yet: I don't know what some of these people were smoking when they were writing these reviews. This is Clancy's best book yet. He has wonderful details, a great writing technique, and a storyline that even suprised me at the end. This is Clancy's best book."
0," not very good: i thought that the book was not very good the first book was much better. In the first book ""the fall of reach"" you learn about the Master Chief and the Spartans you learn why Master Chief is the only one of his kind left. you learn all about his training and it leads up to the game perfectly....but when i read the second book ""the flood"" i thought it shouldnt have been written.... maybe if you havent played the game you should read it but for all of us [real] Halo fans you played the game and already know whats going to happen. so i wasnt really into the book because i already knew the outcome. In ""the fall of reach"" you dont know whats going to happen next. so i recomend reading Halo ""the fall of reach"""
0," Mediocre at best: If you love XML and SQLCLR, this book is for you. For me, I do most of my work using .NET and T-SQL. This book left me wanting when learning about those topics. I love XML like the next person but having so much dedicated space to it is overkill for most people. Save your money if you're a mainstream SQL Server developer and buy a different book."
0," Not worth the money: I was really disappointed with this book. The cover says ""If you loved THE DA VINCI CODE, you'll flip over REVELATION.This book is nothing like the CODE. There is no mystery involved even though the author tries to make you believe it.I liked the characters in the novel. It's too bad the author didn't give them something more mysterious and interesting to do. Please don't buy this book if your looking for another page-turner like the CODE. This book is sorely lacking in great action and mystery that made the CODE so much fun."
0," What's So Great About It?: I feel like SIMON COWELL and I'm sorry, but I just don't see what was so great about this book. It was boring and the plot was very weak. Need I say more? Well, I will. I usually love this author."
0," Desert for Cinema: The Virgin Suicides is a movie for kids about kid's world.Five unjustifiable suicides are added to give a thrill and make the adults consume too.Cecile's suicide is the only enigmatic one. For the others, why not wait to become eighteen? Lux was seventeen less than one year older and she could leave home.What I wonder is what made americans turn the book into a besteseller!!!!"
1," animals rule!: if you enjoy this book, you have to read ""Lord of the flies"" It has a very similar lesson to learn.......both books demonstrate what happens with ""freedom"" when no ""real"" laws are put in place.....have fun reading."
0, Disappointed: Within the 4th time using the one or more of the buttons would either not press down or would not come up. I would have to play around with a screw driver to push up or down. Very disappointed.
1," Good story but not sure how truthful or accurate: John Young Nelson tells a good story. But in truth, this book needs to be reissued and fully edited by someone knowledgeable enough to separate the fact from the fiction. Nelson left home at an early age and headed west after a falling out with his father. He ends up living with the Sioux, then the Mormons, and back with the Sioux, with his share of adventures along the way. Overall, worth your time and offers a glimpse of what life was like back then, despite some questionable details."
0," Nice clock...when it works: I purchased this clock after reading favorable reviews. It really is a great value. After receiving, I was impressed by its quality of construction and range of features. Later that day I turned it on again and it displayed the last mode I had used but would not do anything (start, stop, change modes, or even turn off). I had to manually press the little reset button on the bottom. It then appeared to work fine again. The next day, the same thing happened so I exchanged it (thinking I had gotten a lemon). Amazon immediately sent a replacement which exhibited the same behavior. Unfortunately, I had to ask for a refund. There is a serious quality control issue that needs to be addressed before I could recommend this clock."
1, Gift for a granddaugter: My grandaughter is a fan and I bought this for her. Says that she loves the book. My daughter is reading it now. So far she likes it very much.
1," Pensive, intricate, and beautiful: This album is what music is all about. If I'm guessing right, the reviewer from Italy below compares this to the impressionistic music of Debussy et al. That's an apt comparison. It's not as 'free form' as Keith Jarrett (one of Brahem's major influences); it's structured music, but certainly doesn't let its meter weigh it down. Rarely do all three instruments combine. Instead, one instrumentalist will muse and the others will fill in or respond.The first three tracks are moody and exquisite. The fourth, ""Pique-Nique a Nagpur"", is a playful delight but it's not shallow. ""C'est Ailleurs"" is gorgeous.Perfect for a rainy day."
0," This Stinks!: We used the Diaper Genie with my daughter and her room constantly smelled like a Port-o-let. It was awful! When I found out I was pregnant again and would have two babies in diapers, we purchased the Diaper Genie II system. I love it! With more than twice the diapers, it contains the odors better, guests can figure it out, and since there is no twisting, the cartridge refill lasts much, much longer! The extra $10 you spend on the Diaper Genie II will be saved in cartridge refills in no time! I highly recommend the Diaper Genie II."
0," Not What We Thought: My wife and I bought this item because we thought we would have access to a toaster that toasted bread better than a toaster oven and also have access to an oven for other cooking needs. A single appliance that did the work of two and saved space. However we soon learned that the ""toaster"" does not toast as well as the oven, and more importantly, the ""oven"" is very small. There is vey little depth to the appliance. The literature indicates the oven can fit 2 slices of pizza on the rack. In my opinion, the slices would have to be very narrow, and even then you might have to place the slices on top of each other. But even that might not work if the end crusts were thick because there isn't much height from the rack to the bottom of the toaster section.Hamilton Beach offers a 4-slice toaster oven that probably offers greater depth but we will most likely purchase a traditional toaster oven soon."
0, The best of Tamilee Webb 2-pk: I didn't care for these. Seems like there were off the wall moves/exercises and it didn't motivate me at all
0," Disappointing Quality, Too Soft and Breaks When Sharpened: If you have been looking for the Revlon nail whitening pencil, do not buy the Sally Hansen version. It doesn't sharpen well; it breaks off every time I get it to a point sharp enough to work. Very frustrating. Unfortunately, it looks like Revlon has discontinued their version.But I do have good news: I took a chance and ordered the ""Flowery"" brand from Amazon, and it is harder material and easy to sharpen, works just like the Revlon and seems like it will last a long time.PS- I'm logged in under my husband's account! He does not whiten his nails. :-)"
0, Skip It: If your under 12 you may like the movie. If your an avid Star Wars fan you will cry! It is a sad movie I mean sad from begining to end. I am such a big fan of StarWars I can quote complete dialogue from the first trilogy. I have read all the books even the ones for episodes 7/8/9 by Timothy Zaun but could not make any real connections between the trilogy and this episode.
0, gave up on it: This one didn't grab me. 37% of the way in I gave up on it. Sorry it was simply a trudge to get that far in.
1," good program: I haven't had a full chance in doin this program, but i must say, when i did do disc one, i was at aww...i mean, i was like ""really? you want me to do what?"" but in a good way. I love to have challenges put to the test and this is a good challenge :)"
1," ""The Book Thief"": A different type of story about a young girl alone at the begining of WW2 in Germany. How she survives and what life was like during that time. The author has done a good job in describing the characters in the book. Anyone who lived through this historic period probably knows about the war and the battles but little about how people survived on the home fronts. The book held my interest but I am not sure I liked how the book ended."
0," Why Maggie Gyllenhaal?: This book is wonderful, but why did they choose this reader? She says her ""s""es like she is spitting into your ear. Or, like a snake. Very detracting from the actual book!"
1," Lovely work, as is usual for Carroll: ""Walker Easterling, an actor, saves a woman's life only to place her in infinitely greater danger by falling in love with her. Maris York, an artist, is an androgynous beauty who arouses incinerating passions in the men around her. Sleeping In Flame is a novel populated by a shaman with a fondness for sandwiches, an autistic Adonis, and a tiny man as powerful and ravenously jealous as the God of the Old Testament."" (cover blurb, paraphrased)Just when the reader thinks he's in the middle of a slice-of-life romance, this novel takes a sharp left turn and veers into classic Carroll territory -- in other words, deep into the mythic and the folkloric. That jealous old man claims to be Walker's father, and Walker isn't who he thinks he is. Carroll treats us to clear rich prose, and somehow makes even the most fantastic situations seem plausible and perfectly ordinary.Jonathan Carroll remains one of my favorite ""unknown"" authors."
0," VERY bad video quality.: We did not rent HD as we never do and most times the quality is just fine, but this one is very unclear and uncrisp. Disappointed we spend the money on this!"
1," For those serious in becoming Private Traders: This book requires you to have a strong will and desire to achieve the goal of being a trader. With that, you will be fully able to summon your mental resources to try to understand this excellent book. If you don't have the will & desire, then it will just be another technical analysis book with many tools. I enjoyed this book tremendously and am now slowly but surely moving forward along the difficult path to becoming a private trader. I wish you good trading ahead!"
0, Hoover U5468-900 Quality: This vaccuum is a joke. We purchased one and it vibrated quite a bit and sounded like an Cessna twin engine airplane taking off. We sent it back and received another; same situation. We thought it was factory defect. The second unit we received was sent back as well. Do not buy this vacuum. Eventually purchased another Hoover model vacuum locally. No problems...
0," Missed the mark for me: This book was highly recommended to me, and I looked forward to reading it. However, I found the stories uneven, and while some of the them were quite good, others were forgettable. I passed it on to a friend to get her reaction, and haven't heard back yet."
0," Given the choice, try William Poundstone's book instead.: Being a fan of biographies in general and Carl Sagan in particular, I have to say that this book was extremely disappointing. Davidson apparently felt that he was obligated to insert as many negative comments about Sagan as possible in the guise of presenting a balanced view of the man. Is it surprising that Sagan's ex-wife, Lynn Margulis, had almost nothing nice to say about him? Given that Davidson quotes her extensively throughout the book, one is led to believe that her statements are facts rather than opinions - or, more precisely, accusations. Davidson, while acknowledging Sagan's talents and intellectual achievements, also implies repeatedly that Sagan was egotistical, self-centered and self-serving in virtually everything he did. I doubt that anyone who has read Sagan's books would agree. My advice to those who want to read a biography about Sagan is to try Poundstone's book. I haven't read it yet, but it can't be worse than this one."
1," Tuxedo Shirt - perfect fit: The shirt was received in record time for a last minute important event. My husband has a large neck and we could not find his size in the store without having to pay an incredible price. The size selected fit him fine. The shirt was nice material and had the tie and accessories were, as promised. I was informed of the purchase the entire way to my doorstep.Tuxedo Shirt - Wing Collar 1/8"" Pleat 65% Polyester 35% CottonI would recommend using them again in the future."
1, Sterling Silver Box Chain: The necklace is beautiful! It is very sturdy and exceeded my expectations! You CANNOT find a quality necklace like this anwhere for the price! A must buy!
1," Must-Read for Every Investor: It's Earnings that Count should be on every investor's bookshelf. Whether you are a seasoned investor with an extensive background in accounting or just a beginner, this book is a must-read. Hewitt Heiserman effortlessly incorporates Benjamin Graham's defensive and enterprising perspectives into one easy-to-use system to determine a company's true earnings power. While these two methods are well known to the avid investor, Mr. Heiserman presents them in a fresh visual perspective, which through example, empowers the reader to not only learn how to discover the next Microsoft, but also how to avoid the next Enron or WorldCom."
1, I love this cd!: A friend just gave this to me as a gift - I haven't heard anything quite like this in a while. I haven't been able to stop playing it! I love the smooth flow of the lyrics and the R&B/Jazz mix. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh approach to a relaxing soothing muscial experience.
0," Buggy and lousy synchronzation with handheld: The product looks like it has not been tested adequately and rushed to the market. Daily record from my palm was not saved after a synchronization on the PC. Worse, a task without a reminder in Outlook ended up being a task with a reminder in my palm and the reminder for the task could not be turned off - FC reminder screen was not responsive, so I had an alarm and buzzer that would not stop. After a soft reset, the alarm and buzzer came back on the only way to stop it was using a hard reset and losing all my data.I hope they release a patch very quickly to fix these bugs. I would recommend folks not wasting money until the problems are fixed"
1, A Beautiful album!: Ihighly recommend this album. Dale Kristien has such a very beautiful voice! I'd give this album 10 stars if I could.
1," Your standard, tried and true pitching machine!: This thing, and others (same brand/model) just like it, are our little league work horses for all machine pitch levels. Even kid pitch levels use these for practices.With consistent ball type/weight/wetness, you will get much more consistent pitches. It's when you use different ball types/weights/wetness, that you will get pitches that don't stay as tight as you'd like them to. This should not be a surprise, but some coaches are caught off guard...Be sure to always check tire pressure on these - that's a key maintenance point. Every so often sanding the tire (while it's running, just use some light grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots) also helps improve consistency.With very basic maintenance, you should literally get years of use out of this machine! A great ROI considering only $1k, no tax, and free shipping with Amazon Prime."
1," Really heat retardent: Actually I bought this to fix the inspection door of my furnace.There was a hight temp gasket that wore out,so I figured if this product could handle header heat it sure could handle what I was going to do with it...and it did"
1," The item and service was outstanding: I have looked for this type of Bubba Keg for two years. I had a small one and went online using the name. I found it and ordered two of then through Anazon. I keeps the water cold for more than the 24 hours. This was better than I thought. It is not flashy so I can take it to sensitive places without being ""flashy"". Both my husband and I use the Keg 24/7 and are very pleased.My first location to to search for the keg and other items I need is Amazon. I have never been disappointed. I recommend the keg to all who mentions it. I also recommand Amazon for their source of any item.Thank you very much. Any other items you have please feel free to e-mail me a description.Thanks again.Alice"
0," Big Disappointment: After reading the mixed reviews, I decided to give this chair the benefit of the doubt and was so excited when it came today. I have a 1 year old and nanny two other babies during the day so I was desperate for something to make mealtimes a little easier. I opened the box and put the chair together only to realize that the arm pieces of my chair didn't match the pictures in the direction booklet. the lower arm that is supposed to sit under the table is welded so that it pokes up higher than the upper arm - it's impossible to use as the arm position propels the chair at a freakish angle and won't latch onto any surface. (I tried to attach some pictures to show this but it won't let me). After messing with it for an hour trying to find any way to make it work, i took it apart and packaged it back up. I'll be sending it back this afternoon. Such a disappointment. Don't waste your money."
0," Awful colors on this Special Edition DVD: We enjoyed very much of this outstanding miniseries on the VHS tapes. So, we bought this Special Edition DVD for Christmas - repeated playing would wear out the VHS tapes.BAD thing about this DVD:Like many reviewers here had said already. Awful awful colors, especially on the disk one. There is way too much contrast, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The outdoor scenes hurt my eyes! Everyone looks ill; and it's hard to tell where darkness end and hair starts on most characters. The furnitures have no detail, they just disappear into the darkness.GOOD things about this DVD:1) Widescreen, although I doubt that I missed anything on the VHS format.2) The removal of episodes end credits.3) It has the closed captioning (subtitle) in English. It let me see what they are saying.Let the buyer beware!!"
1, spanner wrench: The tool is well construced and I used it the day that it was received. A very good tool for the price.
1, EXPENSIVE BUT GOOD SUGAR FREE CANDY: the price is too high but I like to eat these gummi candies because they are chewey and sugar-free. eating too much at one time will bother your digestive tract.
0," It just doesn't work!!!: I ignored the recent negative reviews that states that this product only boost signal within 5 feet of the unit, which is exactly what it does. So it doesn't work because I cannot be within 5 feet of the unit most of the time; my house is bigger than that. And the sad thing is that I was hoping it would strengthen as time goes by, until the return date expired which I forgot to monitor. If you buy this product and it only works within 5 feet return it immediately."
1," Great Product, but MUST read instructions to operate: This did well at keeping odors at bay, in our nursery. You do need to fully read the instructions though, don't be in a hurry. Once you understand how unit works, it is easy to empty, and put refills in. Needs complete emptying every 2-3 days, and this is with a 5 month old baby, who poopies more than newborns. It controls odor on the outside, however, the inside of the Genie needs to be wiped out with anibacterial cleaner wipes, as stentch of dirty diapers is absorbed by the inside plastic. The refills for the Genie are scented, which helps to control the odor, too. My only complaint with it, is that it needs to be emptied so frequently, it only holds 12-15 size 3 diapers. But obviously, no one wants a diaper disposal unit to sit in nursery for a week! That would be unsanitary! lol! Overall a good unit, for a good price. Refills are expensive though, around $.. to $.., but we only go through about 1 refill a month, which isn't too bad."
1, Dereks Review: This book is definatly a spotlight Of how even though a rockstar can have so much money and be loved by all sometimes you dont know how to love yourself and others .Also it shows that he had a really messed up childhood that would make some people afraid and may even have nightmares of what they were seeing or hearing about .
0," not as good as I thought:(: Not really what I expected and not very interesting, it was too short a documentary:( It could have reflected a more personal view of some of the girls on this program and more detail of their struggles"
0," This book belongs in Humor: This book claims that nearly all American Programmers would be standing in unemployment lines in 1999. Please note that everything that Yourdon does is *satire* - not real! When you realize the angle he aproaches life with, you understand the satire of this book, as well as his Y2K doomsday predictions. Better hurry, this level of satire seems like a tough one to ride!"
1," Fantastic sounds: Every time I play this C.D. among friends someone asks to borrow it because they like it so much. One can listen to this C.D. three-hundred times and never get tired of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes likes acid jazz type instrumental music, though it is very difficult to categorize this music into any one particular genre."
1," Unique Documentary: Explores the struggles and achievements faced by people in the field of psychopharmacology. If you turn on the subtitles (so you don't miss anything they say), you will be blown away by the knowledge and wisdom shared by the Shulgins, as well as everyone else that was interviewed.If you like this one, also check out the documentary Electronic Awakening."
0," Build Quality is very low: I bought this and it came with 3 screws that were striped. I did not strip them, they came that way. My friend who has a knack for these things helped me drill one of the screws out and we got in it. Also the shell is very flimsy and dents easily."
0, Too wet: This product although it stores easily is simply does a poor job of sucking up all the water. We will try to get our money back.
0, Devil dog: This movie was very poorly made. I took it straight to the trash. I just didn't like the move at all.
0, Disappointing: My Garmin NUVI was working okay for a couple months and then lost all of the data that I entered for Favorites places. The manual and website are no help trying to what happened and the customer support is next to useless. They keep answering emails with more questions rather than giving answers.
1," The best A+ Cert book I know of.: I have 3 other books, but this is the one that really helped me. It was easy to understand & the content is extrodinary. I will definetly purchase the Server+ & Network+ books."
1," cheap and it works: pretty basic plug it in and enjoy, it works like a gemand it was a penny great sellers I would buy again"
0," the movie is great, but the dvd STINKS: This is one of the all-time greatest car movies every made. the chase scenes are spectacular. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the plot plausible and intriguing.HOWEVER, the dvd RUINED this movie. Although the bonus features are great, they cheaped out and didn't include the original score. Instead of the funky 70s music that totally fit the mood (stuff) that I could have whipped up on my home pc in about 10 minutes.The missing songs and score totally ruined this otherwise terrific movie. You also get to see Halicki's widow insert herself all throughout the special features to the point of nausea. She even credits her own PARENTS with the making of the dvd! WTF???"
1," Wonderful Music from a great Song Writer. Very entertaining!: I consider Jerry Herman a genius as he wrote both words and music. As Carol Channing said, ""When god handed out talent Jerry stood in line twice"""
1," Unforgettable and True: A Jest of God epitomises Margaret Laurence's focus on characters whose stories are usually never told. The protagonist, Rachel, is a spinster school-teacher in small town Manitoba. She is stifled both by her closed community and by internalising their pettiness.Rachel's inner-dialogue sets the claustophobic atmosphere, while also being funny, frustrating and moving. Laurence's portrait of an ordinairy woman coming to terms with herself and with surroundings is flawless and highly readable."
1," R. Kelly at his best!: R. Kelly's 1995 self titled album is a classic R&B album. It's an album that all music fans must have. R.kelly is the best R&B artist ever. he released of 7 albums, each one I would give a 5 star rating, and who ever wouldn't, is crazy. But this is his album I would consider his best album. It has 16 of his greatest tracks ever, including his classic hit ""Down Low"" and other great songs like ""Thank God It's Friday"" and ""Hump Bounce"" Cop this album, you can't have a music collection without it."
0, Don't Waste Your Money: NO STARS. Played fine at first but after several months won't load disc at all. Total Garbage.
1," Quick delivery: I received the Country Life Omega 3 Mood softgels within a few days of my order and the price was right. I couldn't find an Omega 3-only supplement at this strength in my local pharmacies. However, the site needs to be more explicit regarding the strength, which I knew from ordering it previously."
1," Great headphones for the daily commute: I found these headphones great for the long noisy commute. After the foam expans in your ear, you're basically blocked off to the wrld, and able to listen in solitary silence to your favourite music. Sound quality is quite good, yet not as amazing as the KSC75. If you need to block out the annoying chatter and rumble of the bus/train, grab these. If you need a pair of headphones for the quiet of your home, grab the KSC75."
0," Boring: This was definitely the most boring Jackie Collins book I have read so far. I couldn't wait to finish reading it, I was hoping for something exciting to happen, like in her Lucky Series. But the book was long and terrible."
1, Excellent service: Great to be able to get this as it is out of print - arrived on time and in excellent shape
1, Value the works of an aging poet for what they are: Visit the following URL for my review of Electric Light:http://webpages.ursinus.edu/rrichter/heaney.htm
0," This book stinks: I don't like any thing about this book except for the title. I can't even tell who is talking or what is happening.I didn't even know the main character's name until I read the back. It seemed like the author was reading a dictionary while writing this. I had to read it although I lost interest on the first page. It may be easier for older peaple to read, but I don't think any kid would enjoy this."
0," does not work for me: I don't know how the other reviewers gave this item such a high rating, I found it very hard to tell the PH from the color grid, all the alkaline colors are very similar and its very hard to determine exactly what your PH is."
1, strong and easy to install: made of sturdy steel. only took minutes to install. the initial order was lost by the post office but the shipper (Niagra) immediately sent a replacement when they realized the post office error
1," Brad is the man: If I were in charge of getting an artist to score a film, I would hire Brad Fiedel. 'Nuff said."
1, classic very entertaining: Say what you wan about the sound track but the performances of the three main characters really make the film what it is. Smart and hilarious.
1," painful transaction, Filters-Now is great though.: good stuff just make sure you order the right size. beware that 24 x 24 x 1 comes in two sizes, (23.38 x 23.38 actual size vs. 23.75 x 23.75 actual size). I chose the smaller size I needed by mistake. I paid eight bucks in shipping to begin with, then it was 14.50 to send them back. Of course, UPS damaged the return (so I was told) thus reducing my credit by another ten bucks to 20 on 58 paid so far for nada. Meanwhile my allergies are killing me. Anyway, my point is don't ever try to order furnace filters online because it's easy without knowing the exact measurements you need to the millimeter. The filters-now company is legit as long as you call them direct and get er dun that way. They give you great southern hospitality style customer service and they make sure the order specifications are correct before confirming your order."
0," Zipper opens during washing/drying: I should have paid attention to the review or reviews that stated the zipper did not stay closed. The first time I thought perhaps I had neglected to close it tightly. The next two times I double checked the zipper before washing and I had closed it tightly, Twice it has opened during washing and once during drying dumping everything in the machine. Who needs it!!!! I have a front loading washer and dryer.And I wash on the easy care or delicate cycle,"
0," It all comes down to Time: Purchased this Battery in October, 2009, as a back up. It was installed late November, 2009 and Died early March 2010. This time I found a Panasonic battery for my Panasonic phone for half the price. Time will tell if it will last any longer, but it could not be any worse, and if it is the same, it cost me 1/2 the price..... I can not recommend this battery"
1," Cute: These are cute but the variety within the pack is somewhat limited. Also I used them on different surfaces, like paint, wood, plastic, etc. I have to keep pressing the ones on the wood back down. But they are cute in my Florida-themed bathroom"
1," These diapers really do dipe!: There's not much more to say except that these diapers really do their job: they absorb number 1, number 2, and even number 3 when necessary. They do the job without complaint, and with disregard for the producer of the respective number. We keep these around our house for when the children do a number - the fact that they coem in cases means we run out of the less frequently. Dipe, and dipe well!!!"
0," Old firmware does not work with Canon DSLR cameras: Some of 80x Lexar CF cards including this 1G ones do not work with Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II, EOS-1D Mark II, EOS 20D, and EOS Digital Rebel XT. Lexar released a firmware update on June 3rd, without which you may have a problem of images disappearing. Be careful not to buy a CF card with old firmware since YOU have to bear the cost of sending a defective unit for upgrade service.[...]"
0," Another Sandra movie: This(In my opinion) it's the worst film that Snadra ever acted in.It's stupid, boring, and nothing original.In the same categorie than Drop dead gorgeous, this film tells the story about the looking like a lesbian cop, Gracie Heart.A mad man is going to attack in the Miss Unite States contest, so Gracie it's the only one than can help, by entering at the contest.She's very ugly, so they re-make her like Pretty woman o Princess diaries style.And now Sandra loosk like...WOW!But that, i'm afraid to say it's what the director calls PLOT.Better luck next time for him! But i didn't enjoy this film at all.I know a lot of you film lovers liked this one, but ther was something mising here for me, may be creativity.Just wanting for Sandra's next fil a little upset."
0, Self-absorption: I was so disappointed in this book which our book club chose. Martha Beck is incredibly self-absorbed. I am curious as to how a book with so flimsy a plot could get published. Perhaps its Martha's ivy league education that allows for this after all. The stories of morning sickness are so exaggerated beyond belief. She should have lost her other child due to neglect. A disappointing read and author.
1," Works great and easy to install: This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws. I was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy. I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw, disconnected the bolt, and lowered it to the floor. After that, the installation goes very easy and straightforward. Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good. Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw. I recommend this accessory."
0," Horrible text: While the illustrations are fair, the rhyming text for this book is just horrible. The rhymes are forced and sing-song. Even my nine-year old daughter groaned. The contrast between present manufacturing processes and those of the past is not made clear. Some of the illustrations are simply inaccurate--such as the drawing of the spinning wheel which would never be able to spin or to twist the thread."
1, Awesome! Sorry I missed it in the theaters!: I love a great story line and this movie had it all! Foreshadowing made the viewing especially entertaining for me because nothing was just for the viewing! Way to go Pixar!!!
0," Not worth a penny: While the movie is a technical masterpiece, it has a loose plot based once again, on sex. I am not knocking it, but I do not think sex,like in this movie, should be shown to young viewers. PG-13? Should be R for sure. Unless you feel you must cheapen your dignity, don't buy this video. Why doesn't the film industry make technical AND dramatic classics? All the old visual and spectacular plotline movies, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, are just considered old junk heaps now. Why has my America cheapened itself by settling with low grade plotlines in exchange for good special effects?(Actually, a majority of the scenes look very artificial.)There is my opinion of this so called ""award winning"" movie."
0," Beeping is terrible!: Although yes, it does what it is supposed to do and takes your temperature, its continuous beeping every few seconds for over a minute is entirely unnecessary. It wakes my husband up and although he does not get angry and knows it is not my fault he does get annoyed at the product (I would find it annoying if the positions were reversed). I am going to look for another product that does not beep the entire time it is taking my temperature."
1," Marking Time: I had the pleasure of meeting Linda Witte Henke (an alum of Trinity Lutheran Seminary) when she was a speaker for a family ministry class at TLS. Her sincerity for the need of this type of book was heart-felt. I anticipated MARKING TIME's publication and am very pleased with its contents. So many times in daily life a special circumstance needs uplifting and this book provides the words (that are sometimes so hard to come by) for those special times and occasions that the church doesn't recognize as sacraments. Within the first week of my book's arrival, it was referenced for an ordination, end of class worship service and a congregation's 100th anniversary. Thanks Linda for your great and much needed contribution to ministry."
1, Awesome!: Love this brush. Makes applying creams and shaving a breeze. Thanks for your great product!! Recommend this brush for first time shavers.
0," Wasted Time and $$: I was very excited and soon very disappointed in this product. It is very difficult to open, does not fit the ipod very well, the seal literally came off the second time I opened it, and after the second song on the first use it flooded, ruining the ipod. It's going in the trash. I ordered a waterproofed ipod shuffle from underwater audio (who has great reviews) and consider it a lesson learned. One saving grace, I might be able to use the headphones I have. Buyer beware"
1," Hamish must find the murderer of the most hated man in town: Fergus the dustman or garbage man is the most hated man in town. He drinks, he beats his wife, and since he was promoted to enviromental supervisor and given a new uniform, he's turned into a tyrant. People are required to sort and recycle and if they don't, their garbage is left. Fergus has also started to blackmail various members of the community. One day, he is found in one of the wheelie bins with his head bashed in, and Hamish has to find out who killed him.This is another excellent Hamish Mc Beth mystery. All of the usual Lochdubh characters are involved and we meet a few new ones also. This is a really quick read."
1, Awesome CD: Bo takes a mediocre song and gives it soul. He takes an outdated song and makes it live and breathe again. I cannot wait for the full album. This is a can't go wrong CD.
1," Great Holiday Family Movie: Considering there are many holiday movies out there, this one for me tops it off. I guess since me and my dad have always been Chevy Chase fans, this one tops it off."
1, Emotional Ending: I thought this a very well written book.I had a hard time with the ending...very emotional. Good job.
0," Excellent Bypass Candidate: Before it was released, Windows ME was widely perceived as the home edition of Windows 2000 Professional. As it turned out, it is the latest version of Windows 9x. By no stretch of imagination does it have the stability and the robustness of Windows 2000 Professional. I tried installing Windows ME on a system that had previously run Windows 95, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, three distributions of Linux and FreeBSD flawlessly. I experienced video problems, hard disk crashes and ME getting corrupted repeatedly. I tried reinstalling more than once, both as an upgrade and as clean install after formatting the hard disk to no avail. This operating system is simply not stable. Considering the fact that Windows XP is on the market, I don't expect Microsoft to spend much effort in fixing ME. If you are upgrading from a previous Windows version, bypassing ME is a very prudent decision."
1," Great Concept but not for joggers: The product works wonderfully for all but the family jogger. Despite the""shock resistent"" description on the product, a jogger can not use this great concept (the device skips). This is disappointing given the large number of joggers. The problem of developing a useful device for joggers remains to be solved."
0," Seeing a little bit of America and too much of the boy: I evaluated this book to use with audiences outside of the United States. The book didn't communicate the message we wanted. A 16-year old (who looks about 8 in the drawings) driving across the US by himself. Then, towards the end of the book in the state of Nevada, he sheds his clothes and we are presented with a lovely illustration of his backside. It was one of those moments when I thought, ""what was the author thinking"" - this is book for first/second graders.Still looking for a book that shows America in a positive light."
1, Love the stupid shows...: Always loved the mindless stupid shows as I'm usually working with the tv on in the background.. I like stuff that keeps me entertained with limited attention to details...
1, Super awesome: This movie is not as good as the first but the end fight scene is definitely awesome. And the movie on the whole is pretty rad.
1, DELICIOUS!!!: What a delicious feast of recipes! I've dined on Chicken Piccata. It was great! Now to try her Chocolate Mousse...I can't wait!Florence Henderson is a multi-talented woman...and one of the nicest people there is!
0," Poor quality: First table had a large split down the center. Didn't even unwrap the rest of the table. Ordered a replacement, which came with part of the table top glued off center, so that unfinished wood was showing around the edges. Top was also slightly warped, and had a knot hole with a crack in it that looked like it might expand over time. Liked the style of the table, but there were too many flaws, even for the, even for the relatively inexpensive price. On the plus side, both deliveries came two days after I ordered them!"
0," Not the Best Big Comfy Couch Video: My 3 year old daughter loves the Big Comfy Couch, but does not care for this particular video at all. I hate to say anything negative about the Big Comfy Couch, but for some reason they stuck an annoying ""hard rock"" style song into the middle of this otherwise cute video. Even Barney songs all have melodies that will eventually grow on you, but this rock song about interrupting is unbearable! Without this song, the video would be a 3 star video.I recommend sticking to all of the other great Big Comfy Couch videos that follow a variety format more like the TV show. The ""Are you Ready for School"" one is my daughter's favorite."
0, Loved the Movie - Hate Being Hosed: They could have included both versions in the Blu-ray release. If people are not interested in the extended they could have decided which they wanted to buy. There is no way that I am going to buy this.
1," Awesome: This is an excellent cd. If you like other unwritten law cds youll love this one. I dont know what to compare it to, but its great. Buy it as soon as possible!"
1, Great Patterns: I am still new to knitting but these patterns are easy to follow. I originally got this book from my local library and just had to own it. I love the easy patterns and the challenge to expand my skills. Great book!
0," Frustrating waste of time and money: I have nothing good to say about this scanner. The image quality is very poor, it is slow, the bundled software is awful, and there is a bug in their driver. I have used it with two computers, and AMD-K6 200mHz running Win98 and a Pentium 3 933mHz running WinXP, and with both computers it did the same thing: It worked fine for a while, and then it would just stop working and I would get an error message telling me that there is a problem with the SCSI host adapter. I don't even have one! My scanner is connected to the Parallel port. Argh. It was so frustrating; I would not recommend this scanner to anyone. Go buy a cheap Canon."
0," Doesn't even deserve one star.: I make it a point not to read reviews or plot lines before reading books. I want to be surprised. Boy was I surprised. This started out as the typical Danielle Steele book (she tends to get in a rut, but sometimes the old standbys are comforting) but then it went so far askew. The only reason I finished the book was that I was hoping she'd somehow turned it around (like Bobby's dream in Dallas) and redeem herself. No such luck. It's not worth the time."
0, Incompetent: Franks is an incompetent political hack. He parrots the Bush line with total disregard for the lives and welfare of his troops. How is it that he was so short sighted to think they could start pulling troops out of Iraq right after the invasion? How is it that he was able to retire when his men are all on stop loss? Then when his mean are dying in Iraq he travels around during the Bush campaign promoting another incompetent hack like himself. This is the kind of General the Bush administration likes. Say what we want you to say and think of yourself first just like we do.
0," Gunman's Goal: Reprint of THREE ON THE TRAIL, if you already have that book, this edition has about three more pages."
1," Good Entertainment: The ""story"" is a little weak and has been done a million times in other movies, but the dancing in this is fantastic, and Robert Hoffman is EXTREMELY charming. Adam Sevani (Moose) is a great surprise. The final dance scene is well worth watching the movie for, unique and immensely entertaining. It's not going to win Oscars but you will be entertained and probably want to watch it again just for the amazing dancing."
0," Poorly written, gratuitous tripe sweeps nation: Save yourself the ten bucks - The Wasp Factory is about the single most simplistic, poorly written & juvenile attempt at naked shock value that I've ever had the displeasure to rest my eyes on.If you do plan on reading this worthless piece of trash, do yourself a favor and skip the last chapter. The ""shocking surprise ending"" is nothing of the sort.No stars, I really really really (thats three) hated this book - It sucks. Iain Banks is a cheap huckster. I wasted my money, I feel used. Enjoy."
0," Great voice,forgettable songs....: The only thing she has that Britney doesn't is a good powerful voice,but she's still singing semi-funky bubblegum Mickey Mouse songs..The less clothes she wears,the more boring she is...Hopefully,she'll fade away and maybe do Vegas or a strip show.Or just fade away period!! BORING!!"
0," FIX YOUR WEBSITE: DON""T MARKET THE WRONG TRANSLATION: It's completely false advertizing for you to sell the Davis translation and then make people download the much older Montcrief translation. Get it together Amazon!"
0," OMG!!!! Please stop burning and itching!!!: Why don't they have a warning on the package of this product! I used this and within an hour I was curled up in a ball about to cry. Burning, itching, swelling! Please do not use this, save yourself from the pain and discomfort it causes. Nothing helps not even showering and it's been 3 hours. This 1 day monistat needs to be taken off the shelf or at least have a warning on the box."
1," Great pieces -- by people I know!: I attend UCSB and have studied composition with both Jeremy Haladyna and William Kraft, who each contribute one premier to this fine CD. It's great music-- just be warned, you do have to really like contemporary art music. Jill Felber (also at UCSB) plays superbly... as always. Buy now!"
0," Mostly the same songs....again (sigh).: Cass Elliot's first two albums are rereleased here along with some B-sides and previously unreleased material such as ""Darling, Be Home Soon,"" ""Sisotowbell Lane,"" and ""For As Long As You Need Me."" ""Different"" and ""All For Me'"" are released on this CD also, and to my knowledge this is the only CD that they have ever been released on. My main complaint is the price. Even though I paid for it for the unreleased songs, it is obvious that the record companies are trying to ""stick it"" to the consumer. Most people aren't going to pay $50.00 for one CD. The unreleased material is so-so at best. It is up to you whether or not you want to spend the money on this CD. I won't even bother asking why they won't release the entire ""The Road Is No Place For A Lady"" on CD yet."
0," Disappointing: I love Aisha Tyler. She is the funniest woman in showbiz! But, this book lacks depth. I could not wait to read this book. I am a late sleeper, and I watched Aisha on KUSI Channel 9 in San Diego in anticipation of her book! But it is not worthy of the genius bookwriters out there who deserve there credits. She bored me with her over annalyzing of everything. From a strong woman's stance, it made me feel like someone was telling how I shoud be cool. Aisha you are a intelligent and comical person. Please be less judgemental on the next book, and just let things flow. Love ya, Tamara"
0, Big disappointment: Upon hearing the great single Living Years I immediately and eagerly purchased the CD... and played it several times in disgust and shock. I kept hoping I just hadn't been paying attention. I was.This is poorly composed formula pop and in my opinion is uninspired. Just buy the single. The rest of this piece of caca is a waste of your time and money.The first album and Word of Mouth are great discs worth having. Buy them instead. My 2 cents.
1," He Just Needed A Hug...: Poor John Kirby (Brian Libby), if only he'd taken his pills, all would have been well. Alas, he dropped them on the floor, leading to a husband and wife massacre by axe. John is then captured by police, escapes, and is gunned down by sheriff Stevens (Chuck Norris). John is revived and kept alive by looney doctors who try their new experimental serum on him. This turns Mr. Kirby into an indestructible juggernaut of death! Meanwhile, the sheriff is busy battling bikers and rekindling a romance w/ his ex-girlfriend. Soon John kills enough people to get the sheriff's attention. I like SILENT RAGE, and that's saying a lot since I'm no Chuck Norris fan. The scene where Kirby stalks and kills his old psychiatrist (Ron Silver) and his wife is fairly creepy. I also enjoyed the whole hospital-holocaust! I even got a kick (pun? what pun??) out of the karate-man vs. zombie-madman finalé! Very entertaining indeed..."
1," A keeper after 7 years: The real test of a good record is if you still want to listen to it after a year. After seven years in our collection, I'm still listening to this CD and enjoying it tremendously.The sheer virtuosity and polish is just remarkable -- that three kids could play and sing this well, AND write mature and thoughtful songs -- just hard to believe. Chris Thiele's mandolin gets the attention and the ink, but Sarah and Sean Watkins are every bit as special. ""Beauty and the Mess"" packs about as much musicianship as you'll ever hear in 2 1/2 minutes -- Sarah Watkins' vocals are crisp and perfect like a Granny Smith apple, the guitar and mandolin work is fantastic, the rhythms playful, the harmonies interesting. These guys were (and still are) real musicians' musicians."
0," Shadow Warriors: The book was a major disappointment. Shadow Warriors was promoted as an explantion and description of special forces. This is a subject that is especially relevant today. Sadly, the book was narrow, shallow, unfocused, and did not begin to explain special forces when it obviously could have. I guess Clancy's well earned reputation for excellent books allowed him to get a clunker past the editors.Los Altos, CA"
0," Terrible Amazon return service: This product does not even work. It would never link to my PS3 after countless try. When I called the service center to try to find out what was going on, it always went straight to voice mail. I never even heard of any customer service would let you leave voice mail!!!! So, I decided to return it and I followed Amazon's return instruction, and till this day almost 1 month later, I haven't seen my refund yet. ""Good job"" Amazon for allowing yourself to sell such a crappy product and can't even do your refund service right."
0," First Festival was better.: I was at the first event and by comparison to this show I have to say that its not better the second time around. I think that the only thing this show has over the first is Beck and W Nelson . THe whole atmosphere seems very commercial and more of a concert promotion rather than a festival to celebrate the blues and other forms of music with the spotlight on guitar work. I own this dvd and rarely watch it. The vibe on the first festival is better,more like being at Woodstock since it was a whole weekend event and the cotton bowl was packed with about 65000 friendly people."
0," Incomplete and out of date: I bought the Lonely Planet and found it didn't even have a single word about my favorite place in Italy, a small gem of a town with an incredible hostel and scenery (I can't tell the place because I don't want everyone to go there.) It also was very out of date, all of the prices were wrong and I found the reviews of places to be hard to distinguish. It says everything is great so you are left confused about where to spend you time. I ended up using Let's Go which i preferred 100%."
1," First rate swashbuckler!: Captain Blood pales in comparison. This is an Erol Flynn type story with no holds barred. Tougher to make a film on it, but the story is stop notch. I really enjoyed it and was sorry whe the book ended. I wanted more."
1," Value for money: Good, reliable at most times, poor in cities (tried it in downtown chicago and it just couldn't find its way!) The bluetooth is useless but I never bought it for that anyway. Comes witha case and an a/c charger which are unusual these days. Overall a good unit, though you can get newer unit with more up to date technology for the same price these days."
0," Very Disappointed: I'm not sure what the game designers were working towards when they designed this game but it reminded me of something you might come across on Sega Genesis (that is to say, low tech and predictable)."
0," Strange Imagery for Sleep: I have all 4 CDs in this series and I just find this one odd to try to use for bed time. For me, the imagery starts out fine, floating like a feather, clouds, scan for stress. Then, the journey changes into something almost medical. For me, mentaly examining all the details of my feet, then muscles, tendons, bones, marrow, atoms is not really relaxing bedtime material.The music is mostly nice except for some human voice inserts that don't seem to fit to me and add a lot of distraction.This might be a fun trip at a different time of day or if you have different goals, but for me, just not right for bed time."
1," Worth buying! Watch it multiple times.: What a delight this DVD is. Ricky Tims is an amazing quilter, but he is also an excellent communicator and teacher. This filming and lighting throughout this DVD give you a perfect view to see and understand the quilting of Ricky Tims. He takes you though a quilt from inspiration to completion, teaching you a number of techniques along the way.While watching this DVD, I stopped it numerous times to try out or practice some of the things R. was teaching. I would have to say that I am a long way from quilting like Ricky Tims, but I have learned some practical techniques along the way and have some ideas I would like to develop furthur as a result of watching this DVD. I have lent it to several quilters and they all like it. Now if I can only get it back to watch it again!"
0," Don't waste your money or time on this...: After reading the 40+ positive reviews and seeing pictures of peoples' success with the product; I thought this might work. I was terribly disappointed because the product wasn't cheap. The flies swarm in front of the light and never land. =[ I think I am better off swatting flies the old fashioned way with my newspaper. Definitely going to return this since I am not satisfied.*edit*I also wanted to let you folks know that it only comes with one sticky card. I thought for 30 bucks that I would get at least 2.so, i put a piece of food on a napkin and put it on the sticky card and voila! i caught two flies! lol =/"
1," Great bathtub: I got this bathtub as a gift and I love how I can give my little baby girl a bath in the kitchen. This tub fits perfectly in my double sink. She is right at perfect height. My only complaint is the green back really doesn't prevent baby from sliding, I have to place a small hand towel behind her back for every bath, or else she is sliding all over."
0," Not the best: Grendel's previous album, ""Prescription:Medicide,"" sounded like an overly-distorted Embryodead-era Wumpscut (if you don't believe me, go back and listen to track 1, ""Construct Constriction,"" and then go and listen to the title track of Embryodead. Hear it now? Good). After the noteworthy ""Soilbleed"" EP, they have now progressed to...bland, uninteresting harsh EBM. It's not that anything about the album is particularly bad, but rather that it doesn't really stand out with any sound of its own. The synth lines are reminiscent of a dozen bands and just about every recent club-friendly release. The vocals are also the stereotypical distorted scream/sing/speak that gets tiresome by track 2. The programming is just varied enough to guarantee that a human being was involved in the creative aspect at some point, but not interesting enough to merit any serious attention. Great filler music but otherwise wholly unremarkable."
1, ENDGAME: Everyone should watch this - it is a must.Very informative. Information that mainstreammedia will not provide.
0," cheap toy - do not buy: This track is very cheep. It never really worked very well - meaning the motor was unable to get the car to make it all the way around the flimsy track (assembled as per directions). Within the first hour of play, the car's axles (which are made from thin pieces of wire) were bent, and the motors were no longer able to propel the cars.I had giving this toy to my nephew for Christmas. The next day I ran to the local Walmart to buy a different track."
0, crap: My daughter loves her chocolate milk. worked ok. Broke after 2nd use. very disapointing.I guess nothing beats a good old spoon.
0," Man, I was Scared...: that this movie would never end. This movie made me want to shoot myself in the face. Some of the dead bodies and stuff are real, but it's no more gruesome than that show about tornadoes I saw on Discovery the other night. Don't try to find another movie that's more realistic or w/ better death scenes, just save that money for Colt 45 and porn."
0," worthless: After installing the software and hooking up the cable to the computer and the phone, the computer would not recognize my phone as a connected device. This happened on two different computers. This product is effectively worthless."
1," A great witnessing tool!: This Movie is a phenomenon, Like the Book #1 Its true to script and Scripture! You Must take your friends to see this movie in the big screen! Its a great way to share Christ With Those you Love And Dislike!"
1," The pleasure of decapitation: Who ever thought begin decapitated could be so enriching? In this book, Harding does just that to the reader - at least he attempts to have the reader do it to him/herself. This work blends the one theme that Eastern and Western religions/philosophies share - the oneness of all things, and the delusion of separateness. This book is written from a Zen Buddhist perspective, however, Harding pulls from Christianity, Hinduism, science, and other fields to drive his point home. Though this book will not bring you the enlightenment that Harding seems to have received, it will help you to view enlightenment from a unique perspective.This book is short and sweet, and Harding comes across as honest and compassionate. I highly recommend it. I also suggest Stephen Batchelor's ""Living With the Devil"" as a companion to this book. It is a weightier read, but it is nothing short of brilliant."
1, Great Series: This series came in quickly and was in perfect condition. Was very glad to find this here since no one else seems to carry it in their stores anymore.
0," Give that 50 dollars to a charity....: Bought it for my boyfriend. It took him 4 hours to beat the game. So we stared at the credits screen, hoping it was one of those games that continue after the credits. No, all you get are bonuses (so far it seems they are just videos/ads). To get the bonuses, though, you have to go back and play the 10 minigames again, and again, to have enough points. Oh, great!Not worth 50 dollars, or whatever you pay for it.Like most other people said, you use basically the same motions on the minigames... and there are only 10 types of minigames."
1," Good comforter for the price: I was hesitant to buy these at first when I saw it in the gold box. But then I said why the heck not. My hesitation was due to the fact that I had way too many comforters. However, these were the first that I ever bought for myself. The other ones were given to me as gifts. This comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time. I still need an extra blanket as usual since I can get very cold but it's a lot better than my old comforter. Like some other reviews said, the pillow shams are pretty small but it's fine for smaller pillows.A word of advice: most likely, your comforter will arrive extremely.. and I mean EXTREMELY staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box. The solution I have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it. Not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity. So be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy!"
1," KILLED BEARS: Very well written,informative and refreshing. The author writes about a number of incidents which I have not read about elsewhere, an accomplishment given the glut of bear attack books on the market which often rehash the same attacks. The author is not as radical as fellow BC author JG Shelton, so there is not the constant undercurrent of advancing an agenda. The backstory of tracking down the interviews lends local color and the feeling of being there that only the best outdoor writers can accomplish."
0," Couldn't make it past chapter 4 though friends liked it: I had the same experience with this as I did with one of Rettenmund's other books (Blind Items). Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4. Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs. If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you. Personally it drove me crazy."
1," Good: I would like to have it a bit bigger, but in has its size mentioned in a description, hence nothing to complaint about."
1," Amazing then...Amazing now: This album was way ahead of it's time. Today it's as fresh as it was then. If you are a musician, the chords,""melody"",and song structure are amazing. If you are a listener, the music is smooth, calm but haunting and etherial."
1," Very effective: I held off on five stars only because I haven't seen the long-term effect of this. Brought this because I'm so tired of using the water squirt bottles on my newly adopted cat for behavior modification. Soooo pleased to see my cat walk away from the areas I inconspicuously sprayed with the Boundary! I don't have to shout ""no"" (he ignores me) or use the squirt bottle (lasts 10 seconds till he attempts to get on the area again and again and again). Mission accomplished!"
0," Fun at first, then the clunky interface gets boring: This is a fun game to begin with. You run around finding 'minions' who do your bidding out in the world while your character stands around pointing. But then...things start to get annoying.1) You cannot save your progress. There is an 'autosave' function. It only works when you leave a mission. And when you return...you have to replay the WHOLE THING. Just boring and feels like a waste of time.2) Your minions are hard to move about. Yes they're fun as an idea. But the only way to move them is by moving your mouse. They end up all over the place. Clearly this was designed for game controllers and then 'adapted' to PC, and the irritation just keeps accumulating.So, yes, it is fun for a while, and then it just gets annoying. I would not buy it again."
0," Ordered in sept 7th 2011 and its not working today!: It just stopped working, out of the blue today!! I plan on contacting amazon , because i buy a lot from them, so i hope theyll be able to do something for me!"
1," Garmin Carrying Case: Nice, convenient carrying case. I stretched it out to enlarge it a bit and it works easier. Turns on once in a while upon insertion. Who cares! Nice usable product."
1," Tranquility Personified: I've had this CD for over 4 years now, and it's the best purchase I've ever made! Whenever I'm stressed out, this CD always manages to calm me down ... and track 10 (Variations on the Canon by Johann Pachebel) can move me to tears with the first three chords. George Winston is a master pianist and I'd buy any CD he recorded."
1," Must have: This is my second Hot-Shot and I thought they had stopped making it. Spent hours and days looking for it and was thrilled to find it at Amazon! It's the perfect tool for boiling a cup of water when your cooking rice, making tea and is much faster than a microwave. Tip: leave the top open for a few minutes after using it to let the inside dry.Much better than an instant hot water tank at the sink where the water sits around all day collecting minerals."
0," What a ripoff.: This CD is a joke. IT says edited, but it's every bit as uncensored as the explicit version. AND it's 5$ extra. Save your money, or even just pass it up, if it's for a kid. I like the music, not the false advertising. Musically, it should be a 4 and a half stars, but advertising-wise...it's crap."
1," You're never too old for McKillip!: I've loved reading Patricia Mckillip's books since I was a little girl. She is a master wordsmith, weaving words web by web so that you are able to visualize and build the magical world she so wonderfully conveys. Her style is concise, direct and perfect for reading aloud. I loved all the short stories except the very last one,based on ""Beauty and the Beast""--which could have been a little more harrowing. The metaphors and teasing symbolism are lovely little hidden morsels of analysis I love unraveling. This is definitely a book of short stories that I'll read again and again!"
0," Huge Disappointment: Little-to-No Technical Content: The first 250 or so pages provide a decent (at best) high-level description of Computer Forensics, but the next 300 pages have little to do with computer crime investigations. It seems as if this book should really be two books: the first book would provide a good overview of computer forensics for those who are not very technical, and the second book (larger book) would be on Information Warfare. If you are looking for a decent book on forensic computing, with a lot of technical meat, this is NOT your book."
0," Satisfactory, but could be much better.: The book does a reasonably good job of covering the elementary aspects of using SPSS 10.0 for data analysis. Its primary weakness is the lack of data to duplicate the ample examples provided in the book. The book directs the reader to a web site for download of data. However, the data sets at the web site have changed and the results presented in the book cannot be verified or used for practice (e.g., the ""bodyfat"" data set is now ""fat"" and the data has changed). The book needs to be distributed with a data set. SPSS 10.0, Guide to Data Analysis by Norusis includes a data disk and it is nearly identical in most other aspects of the book. The Carver and Nash book has short sections on nonlinear models, basic forecasting techniques, and the Chi-Square tests not covered in the Norusis book if this is important to the reader."
0, pointless: unbelievably boring stay away from this movie. save your time and money. there is just no words to explain how meaningless it is.
1," Keeps the deer away- this product works!: We ahve used this product in the past and found it to be the most effective product to keep the deer away. Yes, it smells when first applied but the odor is goone within hours. Small showers are fine but I wish it wouldn't wash off after a rain storm. Can't have everything, I guess."
0, They said it was funny...but they lie like a rug!: They said it was funny...but they lie like a rug! This is a movie that was too painful to watch. I had to fast-forward through 80% of it just to stay awake.
1," The best phone I have ever bought!!!: I should say that i loved the Nokia brand. But this phone is awesome. The software is nice, a lot of functions, the web site of sony is the best place to found everything you need to take the best performance of the phone. I dont have any disappointments about this product. The Sony W810i is my favorite cell phone is my entertainment center."
1," Susan Egan is the best!: Besides the fact that I'm obsessed with Susan Egan, I love Drat the Cat! as it is an amazing musical with truly talented performers. My favorite songs are: Holmes and Watson, She Touched Me, Wild and Reckless, Other Girls, Dancing With Alice, and I Like Him. Okay, so I know that's a lot but it's great. Get a copy while you can and find out for yourself. And if you would like to hear other Susan Egan albums, check out:The Broadway Cast Recording of Disney's Beauty and the BeastTriumph of LoveSusan Egan: Coffee HouseSo Far...The Secret of Happiness"
0, ISO: This is an ISO - Instrument Shaped Object.Avoid the temptation to get something for nothing.You can't get anything decent in a student violin for under $250.Buyer Beware!
0," Crap!!!: I had one of these and it's crap. Freezes a lot, when you turn it off, you might have a problem to get it back on to keep the right temperature. It takes forever to ""calibrate"" itself. Poor technology."
0," watch out for replacement batteries; ie not Nikon: I ordered a Nikon battery and rec'd an after-market battery, even though it was advertised as made by Nikon. It would be best to call the seller and verify before ordering."
0," Pitiful Excuse for a Sequel: Horrible. Ladyboy s*x = not funny. If you want to find out what I mean by that comment, please, by all means rent this movie. If ladyboy s*x with one of the main characters is not your thing, then run."
1," good relationship book: I love books about families and the things they go thru year after year. How they search for other family members, to meet them and learn more about themselves."
1," Stunning artistry and vocalism: This newly-discovered recital disc from 1985 is a stunning showcase for one of America's finest vocal artists, mezzo Elaine Bonazzi. Ms. Bonazzi graced the opera and concert stage for 4 decades and her performances will be long remembered and cherished. This recital, a pristine digital recording, was made at Peabody Conservatory, when she was teaching there, and it is an admirable showcase for her special communicative powers. The Brahms and Ravel are pretty well known, but the Britten and, especially, the Monteverdi are less familiar. To hear them sung so compellingly and with such artistry is a rare and satisfying treat. And she is joined by some of the finest instrumentalists of the time--pianist Ellen Mack, flutist Timothy Day, violist Karen Tuttle, and the late cellist, Stephen Kates. Don't miss this one!!"
1, cute puppet for the money: This puppet is nice for the money. I use it with four and five year olds and they love it. It is soft and just the right size for 'little hands.'
1, camper hamper: This hamper is great for us! We use it in our rv. I can fold it up completely when not in use!
1," Love books?: I still have not been able to read A Gentle Madness, but from previous reviews, I can get the sense that there is a similar theme to this one.As for Patience and Fortitude--for any book lover, you immediately become overwhelmed by Basbanes' and his interviewees' passion for books. Moreover, the more you read about some of the great collections covered in this book, the more you want to see for yourself. For me, the most intriguing element of the book was the section on the long forgotten libraries of Mt Athos, some of which maintain extensive collections from Byzantium.I was equally interested to read how the major libraries of the world assemble collections, and attempt to maintain them, while filling the need for more computer savvy customers.I hope to read the other books by Basbanes, but if this is the standard for the others, I am sure they will be equally as enjoyable."
1, Greatest Voice book out there!!!: Perfect novel for anyone and everyone looking to gain knowledge on the voice and speaking. I would highly recommend it. Fun read and best resources! Great job JONI
1," A very good album: Released in 1980, it was their second studio album as a duo and their first since 1973 not produced by George Martin. They go back to a simpler production of their early days. The songs are more straightforward folk pop/rock. Best songs are I Do Believe In You, Valentine, Catch That Train, and Coastline."
0," Only received 5 quarts: I'm a fan of Mobil 1, and I was hoping to change the oil in my '04 GTO on Friday. I ordered this item on a Sunday (last Sunday) and I received the item on a Wednesday (today), as advertised. Unfortunately the box only contained five, 1-quart bottles of oil--not six. The customer service representative was very courteous and helpful, but she informed me that if I wanted the additional bottle, I would have to return the box of five. I would then receive a box with six quarts sometime later. This process would put me well beyond this Friday, and potentially even the next Friday.Instead, I'm going to return the five bottles and pick up six at the Advance down the street for a few more bucks.I hesitate to give the item one star, since I've had a good experience with Mobil 1. But at the end of the day, my car needs six quarts..."
0," Lifetime Movie-Of-The-Week Quality: Mingus's parents are getting a divorce, and because they had a biracial marriage, Mingus decides to avoid complications and only date black men. Of course, a minute later she meets a nice white cop who pursues her, and she gets involved with him - only to later meet a nicer black guy. Who will she pick? Well, if you can't tell by page ten, there's something wrong with you, because this novel is as predictable as it is lame. Adams tries to tackle the big issues of race, family and infidelity, but she has about as much success as a Movie-of-the-Week trying to win an Emmy. Jenoyne Adams should stick to dancing. Maybe she can move, but she obviously can't write."
1, good sunscreen: it's a light sunscreen which is good for everyday coverage.blends into skin easily.a drugstore bestbuyThe package is good for preserving the active ingredients
1, Arabian Nights: This is a great story..Very enjoyable! I have been waiting for it to come out on video so that I could own a copy...
1, Moon Globe: Loved the moon globe...would make a wonderful gift to anyone intestered in studying the heavens...the moon phases in particular are so vivid with the globe...get out your telescope ( or not) and see what the heavens have to offer. Then check out the computer to see what NASA has to offer the student.NASA Moon GlobeLeave this on table top or desk for frequent checks!!

0," Out with the new: My old Oregon thermometer worked well but we dropped the outdoor module and it broke. The receiver was good to look at. The purchased RMR382-B was ugly to look at, and the outdoor thermometer didn't work."
0," Mel Gibson was not right for the role.: Mel Gibson is not a good enough actor to play the extremely complicated Hamlet. He tries his best, but his performance looks over-the-top and forced. This movie also suffers from cutting the play almost in half and not developing the character right. I couldn't understand Ophelia's problem because she was so badly developed. Plus the castle the movie is set in is VERY ugly.The movie is difficult to watch because the castle is so ugly. Although it has many faults, the ghost scene is good and done in the correct way."
0," Looks Great But Leaks Water Badly Out the Bottom: This bowl is quite attractive; however it is not as large as I expected from the product description.The bowl leaks vary badly out of the bottom. Since my salad did not drown in liquid, it was not obvious at first. The leakage was slow but noticeable. When I tested it by filling it with water, it leaked an unbelievable stream of water.There was no apparent damage from shipping; the box was not in any way crushed. I think this item was not checked for leakage after it was made. Not very assuring for the manufacturer."
1, GREAT knife: This bread knife is exactly what I wanted. I've recently started making really crusty breads and had trouble cutting them without crushing the bread. The Victorinox slices through the crusts with ease.
1," The Goal: Great book if you want a practical overview of Operations in action. A little corny at times, but still very readable."
0," read for curiosity's sake: Why is this book so famous? Some say for its quality, some say for its incredibly controversial (at the time of publication) sexual content. It's worth reading for the whole *this was banned and mega-controversial and is it pornography or art?* sort of thing, but I didn't think it was believable or otherwise well written. It's quite sexist, and it's somewhat boring."
0," Love/hate relationship: I purchased this for my darling husband and it is/was a great idea; however, after accusing him of using metal utencils and him assuring me he didn't, it went into the trash. He loved it but everything stuck and the non-stick surface wore off after a few uses. It became almost impossible to clean it and I was the one who had to scrap and soak water in it to clean. I am desperately looking for another product that does what this did but with better non-stick surfaces. Any suggestions?"
1," The best diapers!: These are, in my opinion, the best newborn diapers out there. They really contain messes well, and the elasticized waist band adjusts well around baby's waist so you can really use them for the weight range specified."
0," LEAKS!: This is my second BCO-130T Coffee/Espresso machine. The first one worked well for about 8 months then started leaking. They sent me a new one two months after I called customer service. The second unit is now leaking after 11 months of use. Customer Service said that I will need too send to Appliance Parts Mart to get fixed leaving me with out a coffee pot. I responded with ""What am I to make coffe in?"" The CSR Rep said that I should buy a cheap coffee maker to have while mine is in the shop being repaired! Do not waste your money!Spokane, WA"
1," Give it time: Vangelis always produces music that represents a certain atmosphere and place. He does this by taking certain musical styles, sounds, whatever and moulding them with his unique, sonic signature. This is what makes his ""SOUND"". It is futile to compare one album to another with Vangelis' music. With the ""City"" Vangelis conjours up an aural tapestry of urban, city dreamscapes. Remember, this is Vangelis and not the Jam! There are no hard edged political statements here!On a shallow level the music is of a very ambient and sort of a late night jazz pastiche. It is very soundtrack orientated as you would expect but it doesn't carry any of the old, analogue syntheziser passages of old. It has a cold feel, very digital and sampled. This does, however, lend itself beautifully to the feel of the whole album. Give it time and you will see."

0, GROSSLY OVERPRICED: The PRODUCT IS NO MOE EFFECTIVE THAN ALCOHOL SWABS. THE APPLICATOR WASTES FLUID. don't WASTE YOUR MONEY! RIP OFF! The product is not worth the free shipping!
0," Mostly junk: I bought one of these for my two boys room, it worked fine. Well after the boys split into seperate rooms, I decided to buy another but this one, even though it is the same make and model, will not play dvd-r discs. It only says ""no disc"".(...)"
0," A superficial text replete w/grammatical & spelling errors: This book was a great disappointment in both its content and presentation. The treatment of most subjects was extremely superficial. Even more surprising was the extent of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as, reference to a non-existent Figure 6-6. Finally, ""defaultly"" is an annoying example of lazy techno-speak and not an appropriate substitute for the phrase ""by default""."
0," You Get What You Pay For ...: Cheap construction and a tacky charging system requiring a plug-in cable pale in comparison to loud and unrelenting hiss and noise regardless of channel or distance. Unless price is your overriding concern, look elsewhere."
1, Yum Yum!: This was a gift for my bf and he loved it! He loves waffles and this was perfect! They are soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. I should have bought two!
0," So bad I had to watch it.: This film is an attempt to do for the Crocodile what Jaws did for the Great White Shark, except whereas Jaws was a masterful marriage of story line and taught suspense, this is utterly laughable with a cliched and totally preposterous script and some of the worst ""special effects"" I've seen in a long time. Ironically , its awfulness is its redeeming feature...I found myself compelled to watch it because it was so bad."
1," CRUISE CONTROL: Definitely the best of the three, this one is at least a bit credible. I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman made a good sociopath, frankly I wish he had been in it more. This movie is definitely action packed, it's exhaustively so, actually. I really not a big fan of these Mission movies, they are not nearly as good as the Bourne films, but this one kept me interested and I didnt find myself rolling my eyes as much as I had in the other two Mission movies. I appreciated that they gave Ethan a genuine love interest, and I liked how much of the movie was in flashback, that made it more riviting. After the second Mission movie I was not looking forward to another, but after seeing this, I'd definitely see another. Like I stated earlier, this is hardly up to any of the great Bourne movies, but without a question worth a viewing."
1," Balanced and fast: Based on the older (and obsolete) 11A model popular among jazz drummers in the 60s, this stick is slightly larger than the current ""thin stick"" that is designated 7A.The balance of this stick is amazing. The dimensions, 16"" long by 37/64"" diameter, make it an ideal jazz stick or a viable alternative to those who prefer a 7A. The trade-off is slightly thicker than a 7A, but with a lot of balance and a tip that has outstanding rebound characteristics.If you do a lot of cymbal work and want a model that gives maximum definition, this stick is also available with a nylon tip - see ASIN B0002D0R2Q."
0," Pouch is crap: The first day my son was using this, the pouch tore right where the tubing was connected. The pouch is very flimsy leather with a felt type feeling. i would not recommend this to anyone unless they want to use it for display only."
1," Great Price, Great Storage: The price is good and the storage is good, but the performance is not what i expected. Maybe i expected too much. Only thing is is that it doesnt save the images as fast as i would like it to. you have to take the picture and wait about 3 seconds before you can take another. Which then again, my camera is 7.1 mp so the pictures are large. so maybe thats the reason. if there isnt a card made that is faster than this one by enough margin to tell a difference, this is the card to by."
0," Size Choice: The choice of the size should be more clear. I've got the watch, but in a wrong size. There is not a field where you can choose the size of the product, and there is no indication of the size of what you bought at the end of the purchase."
0," EA Sports F1 Challenge '99--'02 review: After reading the positive reviews I thought I would give this one a try. This game sucks. It does not even come close to Sierra's Nascar 2003.(which is awesome) The graphics are poor, and the whole feel of it is very low grade. I do not recommend this game even if you get it for half price. Total waste of money!"
1," Attention Virtual PC / Mac Users: My first impression of this new release is positive - the new centers provide concise information in a snap shot manner that is very easy to use. As a Mac user I have been running QB Premier 2005 in Virtual PC environment for a year or so with no problems. The upgrade to 2006 is a bit more challenging. When you try to run the main ""setup.exe"" I received an immediate error message and the install program crashed. The ""work-around"" to this is to open the folder on the CD called ""QBOOKS"" and run the ""setup.exe"" program in the folder. For whatever reason that one works in Virtual PC while the other one does not. Intuit will not support Virtual PC questions so don't even waste your time on hold... good luck."
1," As a gift, but I want one for me too :): I got this teapot for my sister as part of what will be her Christmas present. I opened it to make sure that everything was ok and it is so cute. I want one for myself now. And it is the perfect size since she is the only tea drinker in her home. And it arrived in no time. It is reasonably priced and goes great in either a classic, modern or eclectic kitchen :)"
1," Good general overview.: This book appeals to a quite broad audience, since deep technical matters are kept to a minimum. In general is well written. However, I would prefer to see more illustrations. I couldn't find any major errors except at page 312 and 313, where Mr. Williams claims that ""...a ruler of length zero doesn't exist. Even if it did, the measured coastline then would be infinitely long"". The statement is regarding the measurement of the length of a certain coastline using a ruler of diminishing length, the outcome must of course, be expressed in terms of a limit. As the length of the ruler goes toward zero, the total length will not go to infinity, since for higher and higher resolution, the line connecting two points becomes straight, and the measured distance will converge toward the true length of the coastline, whatever that finite number is."
0," Obscured by prose: I was always told to read James, but now that I've done so it is clear that I won't have to do so again. The characters were ridiculous, the plot seemed to, at times, be written in code, and though I love a good ghost story I felt that this one fell into the could have been better category."

0," One out of four is not good.: Back Cover description: IN LOVE WITH THE ENEMY. Only a few weeks till Christmas and I'm in danger of losing the job I love and the only family I've ever really known-all thanks to devastatingly gorgeous Marcus Grey. Sure, Marcus has his reasons for wanting to take over the company, but I'm determined to do anything to stop him, even if that means spending time with him...alone, out of the office. After all, it's for the good of Colette, Inc. So what if I wind up losing something even more important...like my heart?This wasn't the worst in the 20 AMBER COURT series, but only one of them was worth reading and this wasn't one of them. Read THE BACHELORETTE by Kate Little instead."
0," Not as easy as it sounds: The filler is well made and good quality but I had a hard time making the capsules.Separating tops and bottoms to put in the filler, spreading the material equally to fill the capsules and tamping that down took more time than manually doing the job with each capsule. The cleanup after capping was an unexpected added chore.Personally I will go back to doing the job by hand, one capsule at a time."
0," Nothing of use in this book: This book is no good. Its hucksterish cover implies that it will help you read the body language of women in order to improve your dating. However, there are really no practical tactics. There are lots of anecdotes mixed in with generalizations (with the ever-present caveat that there are always exceptions to these generalizations). It was written in the 70's, which should imply right there that is is obsolete, and indeed it is."
0," Borrrrrrrrring: I bough this video for my kids and just after 15 minutes of watching it, we turned it off. Although the animation is good, everything else is boring. I almost fell asleap myslef. Do not buy this movie for your kids."
0," Useless bulb: This unit arrived without a working bulb. I still haven't been able to get another, so the unit has been worthless. At $8-$9 for the entire unit, it almost isn't worth getting the bulb itself--might as well get an entirely new unit, except for the sour taste in my mouth from the first."
1, Excellent examples on Change Management from a Leadership lens: Great book on examples for where leadership can go wrong and how to avoid the same for your organization and change projects
1," Welcome Back Kate: Kate, just that little bit poorer would I be without your music. Disc 2 is meditative. It had been so long since she graced us with more music, and then this arrived. Disc 1 a bit more variable but the track Joanni is worth the whole price.Her silence has made this disc ever more mysterious. Listen to her incorporate real bird song into the music, seamlessly. Listen to her laugh her head off on the last track.What does Rolf Harris have to add to this one? Last time it was a didgeridoo. Kate's fans wont be disappointed."
0," Everybody makes the occasional mistake: Not their best album by any means, but an important one as it defined their change in direction to the electronica age. There are a few good songs on this album, but some of the B-sides to the associated singles are better. David J once said there were 29 songs written for this album with the best 10 chosen. I'm interested in hearing the other 19 as I'm certain these weren't the best 10.Anyway, the first half of the album starts OK, but doesn't 'gel' like it should. More like a collection of singles than anything else. The 2nd half is where it all falls apart as the writing just isn't there this time around, however there are some interesting sounds.Love and Rocket's 2nd attempt at electronica with the ""Lift"" album was significantly better."
0," Bad Quality: Very Bad quality all around, The disk it self delaminated, very bad music in vid. Pay the $ and get the Freeman Corban DVD's"
1," DECIDE FOR YOURSELF: It's a sad, sad day when I read this book, shattering my illusions about a great leader of the Civil Rights Movement. I guess the latter-day leadership just isn't up to the standards of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev. Ralph Abernathy. I still don't want to believe all of these allegations without a further show of proof, but the evidence here is damning. Where do we go for leadership from here? This book hurts me when I think about it, but decide for yourself."
1," SECOND STRIKE FROM SEPULTURA!!!!: Most people know SEPULTURA for their later works like CHAOS and ROOTS...but the early SEPULTURA is a young savage beast, and SCHIZOPHRENIA is their second strike!!!! MORBID VISIONS, SEPULTURA's debut is a wonderful trip through the realms of DEATH METAL, and a unique piece on SEP's career...schizophrenia, with Andreas Kisser on the lead guitAR, is when sepultura START A MORE thrash SOUND A LA OLD metallica AND OLD slayer...I really like MORBID VISIONS, but is on SCHIZOPHRENIA that you can hear where these guys were going to...i gotta notice that SEPULTURA is from Brazil, a country where Heavy Metal is really really not popular, and these guys were teenagers by this time and went to USA to bring their METAL to the world!!!! I still think BENEATH THE REMAINS and ARISE are the SEPULTURA's masterpieces, but if you really dig SEPULTURA you gotta listen to SCHIZOPHRENIA!!!! REALLY REALLY GREAT!!! WELL DONE, SEPULTURA!!!!! By FAR the best thing from Brazil!!!!!!!"
0, glad it's short: At least the book was over with quickly. I don't know if I could have taken much more. This kind of effrontery to write 'poetry' is the reason not too many people read it anymore. Writing to an aidience that isn't there.
1," Slime double cylinder foot pump: Works great for my needs (~50psi and below). Seems to pump faster than similar one cylinder foot pumps. This is not the pump pictured, but I expected that. You can see what it looks like on the Slime website under the Tire Care section.http://www.slime.com/Only gets 4 stars though due to cosmetic reasons (bare spots and some small rust spots on the frame of mine) and it feels like it may bend easy.EDIT: Few months later and still as good as new. The only gripe I have is the tube is kinked near the base and it must be straightened before every use."
0," Far too clunky, and poorly written compared to MSOffice XP..: What can I say I am a programmer and I personally like Microsoft software a lot. Why, because it is very well written and extensive. After trying both Star and MS Office, I can honestly say I was much more productive with MS Office. MS Office XP has application crash recovery, and full intigration with the Windows XP interface, kernel, and data security features of the NTFS file system. While it is true that MS Office is expensive, it has never been more true than in this situation that ""you get what you pay for.""Do yourself a favor and get a real Office suite like MS Office or if you just can't see yourself buying a MS product then try Lotus SmartSuite Millenium or WordPerfect Office 2002, they will yield much better results in the long run"
0," It's old.: It needs to be updated, but can be helpful in planning a trip in Mexico. I used it for planning my bike trip from Merida to Punta Allen. There were a couple places where the route suggested was not as good as possible short cuts because of new roads. Hotel and restaurant list is no longer valid."
1," Given the Criterion treatment: One of my favorite films I've ever seen, and probably one of the most poignant LGBT films ever dedicated to film. CC has done this movie and its fans a great favor in releasing it on Blu ray, complete with a beautiful and striking ambient menu (e.g. The Social Network). The accompanying essay is an excellent and concise read that helps further contextualize and deepen the viewer's appreciation of the film. A must have if you love this movie.As of this review it's still on sale, so pick it up for a low price while you can!"
1," Like a looking glass: I have seen this movie five or six times. The one thing I can tell you is that it really has the feel of a culture that is gone. The twenties and thirties were perfectly captured here. Some of the acting is just par, but Cagney takes your focus away from the lower actors and makes the movie. Unlike any gangster movie today, they wern't making this movie to portray an event from decades ago but from the news of the day. That is a much more difficult thing to do, and this was the first gangster movie. This movie has alittle of everything. Tramps, murder, abbuse of a woman(remember that this is just post Victorian era), crime, alittle racism(I mean it is the thirties), and a flaming homosexual. Is it perfect; well no. But, it is still a good movie if only for the historical sense. If you like a more character type of movie check out Little Ceasar, or like a different a more convental gangster check out the original Scarface."
0," PROMOTIONAL BLURB: Psych-K by Rob Williams. This is a very expensive paperback in its class, most run about half this price. It contains is very little that is helpful and a lot of promotions for Mr. William's workshops. If he is going to publish promo material all well and good but it at least ought to be cheap. This book is definitely not worth the money. Invest your book money on Bruce Lipton and others who are more generous and more helpful."
0, thin: This product I thought would be a little thicker with the pad . But is ok .but my dog like more cushion so I put a pillow in it . The product also said it was washable but not direction to do so .
0," TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.: This band has great talent but the album was totaly flat their intent is noticable but not felt,the musical arrangement was horrible and i was REALLY LET DOWN,especially for the price i paid i would have been better spending it on any other album. I give them 1 star for effort but thats about all they will get out of me.I expected alot more especially since they talked about the ""OLD SCHOOL SALSA FEEL"" it felt alot like reggeaton beat...the same beat over and over and over."
1," Good Stuff: No need to say anything except it is a good movie, and fun to watch. Bronson was always interesting in his personalization - sort of dry, but intriguing."
0," Spend your book $$$ on ""Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon"" instead!!!!: Yet another preachy book with the important themes of acceptance ... HOWEVER, ""Odd Velvet"" cannot compare to the rich, crisp text and outstanding illustrations of the Patty Lovell/David Catrow gem ""Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon"". Give ""Molly Lou"" a try!!!"
1," Surprise: I was surprised by this CD. All I looked for was Celtic Thunder"" and expected five men's voices and discovered a group from Baltimore, BALTIMORE?This is a very interesting series of Irish songs, similar to what you might hear in the pub."
1," Jane Green Does it again!: After I read Jemima J, I decided to read another Jane Green novel. This is a wonderful story of 27 year old Libby Mason, trying to find a man. Nick, a former acquaintance, comes into her life, and what was supposed to be a no-commitment relationship, becomes more involved. I thought that with the exception of a very explicit sex scene, that this is a wonderful book. I reccomend this with Jemima J, you won't be able to put them down."
1, Fantastic family fun: Crowns Card Game.What a wonderful game. I have given three other people the game and they enjoy it also.
0, looks cool but worked for 5 min: This item worked for 5 min and stoped working changed the batteries helped but stoped working after 5min. not worth the price. its a rip
1, knocked me off my feet: I dont have the words to describe how beautiful this was and how much it rings true.
1," An enjoyable read: I enjoyed this book. It was pretty much your typical romance with typical plotline. I liked that the heroine was strong-willed and able-bodied without being overly so, and the hero even showed some weaknesses. The genre-standard conflict towards the end was mild enough that it didn't make me want to just smack either of the characters. They actually had pretty good communication, which I appreciated. The sex scene was hot without being ridiculously lusty. There was sufficient hardship and peril, but not so much that it wore me out reading it. The writing did a good job of taking you back in time to that hard place, complete with chaps, cowboy hats, and covered wagons. In all, a thoroughly enjoyable read. I'm glad I Kindled it."
0," Disk's rec'd not as pictured: Buyer beware the disk shown are 16x the disks I rec'd were 8x. I decided to keep and try them, only one disk worked out of all the ones I ordered. Now it's too late to return. I will think twice before ordering again."
1," very good: this movie is very good...it was a little hard to follow in places...the special effects were amazing and the story was great too...it lost points for me when the ending came around, though entertaining and a great 'oooooh' moment, it wasn't well explained, and for an ending like that not to be explained, it lost just an ounce of specialness...good but wierd"
1," For the romantics: This is my favorite version of the Scarlett Pimpernel. Yes, Percy is overly foppish. But a perfect hero balances the perfect fool. I found it more amusing than annoying. Jane Seymour has never been lovelier. The revolution, so bloody, looks better with someone fighting for the guilty ( but not guillotine guilty) rich. I thought it did justice to Baroness Orczy's novel."
1," Good Practice: If you are familiar with the SAT's already, I guess it would work well with you. It provides alot of drill practices, and I believe that after completing the book it does work. I did pretty well on the math section."
1, fun: this boat is very fun to operate some details break off easily but nothing effects its preformence i recommend this to any one who likes boats
1, Excellent book for neophytes and a refresher for those of us have been in the field of family therapy. A must read !: Excellent !!! Grab it and use for your practice whether starting or as a refresher ...
0, A MUST READ THE FINE PRINT TYPE OF COMPANY !!: Don't EVER buy anything from VIDEO PROFESSOR... I did it as a pass thru sale ($6 sale) to accomplish something else and SURPRISE SURPRISE they charged me $189 10 days later because I didn't return a 'Free' CD to them. It's all in the fine print....Refund my money in 21-30 days when I return a 'free' CD that admittedly they DO NOT re-send out to any future 'customers'. This company is working the loops on customer trust. They should be ashamed.
1, Doctor Who The Complete Series: It's fantastic! Every episode is terrific and makes you want to hurry and watch the next one so you can see what happens to the Doctor! It was a great buy. So exciting to know I could preorder it from Amazon.
1," This Family Owned Monticello Longer than the Jeffersons: I am an admirer of Thomas Jefferson and of his magnificent mansion, Monticello. I thought I knew a good deal about both, but was amazed to learn that I had no idea that a family, the Levys, owned Monticello for 89 years, longer than the Jefferson family did--and that the Levys saved it from ruin twice. That's the story this remarkable book tells. I strongly recommend it."
1," Works Great!: I was a bit hesitant in buying this product because I wasn't sure if it would've been compatible with my card/pc, but now I'm glad I got it. It works really well and fast, plus it's small and convenient (less than 3 inches in width and a little over 1/2 inch in thickness. The only drawback I have is that they've reduced the price now after I've already bought it! Unbelievable! But it's a great item and the seller gives a small token of appreciation in the form of candies."
1," Beyond ""Don't talk to Strangers"": My 5 year old twins have always been friendly and they didn't understand the idea ""Don't talk to strangers"". Yellow Dino explains that ""Tricky people"" look like you and me but you can tell that they are tricky by what they are asking you to do (eg. get in a car with them, break a promise to your Mom). In one scene the ""tricky guy"" calls the girl by her name and says he knew her when she was little. Parents should watch this with their kids. Help the child figure out how Reginald Charming knows the girl's name. Discuss the tricks that tricky people use and help your child feel confident that they ""can't fool me"". The songs teach good tactics for a child to respond to a tricky person - take 3 steps back, yell, run and tell, don't worry about hurting his feelings. The songs are unlikely to be big hits but I heard my daughter singing ""My body's mine mine mine"". The right messages are getting through! Recommended age 5- 12."
0, BJ Miller: STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!!! This is just a repackage of the old album. It's just a record label trying to get money. If you want PHM then get the Remaster edition.
1," So dang good other, more well known, bands have begun robbing them.: If you truly love what is base and uncontrolable in rock and roll, if you understand that all which is shambolic messy and sick is still truly alive, just get this. Go see them.Stooges comparisons are predictable, but this band has more in common with what inspired the stooges. I hear the Sonics, and others, and the Black Lips are equally as unlikely to succeed as any of those.There is a song on the Queens Of The Stone Age album Era Vulgaris that lift's directly from ""Can't dance"" which is a real shame because the two bands are really nothing alike. But QOTSA, who have sold millions, clearly recognize and want to tap into what Black Lips have: genuine spunk and vulgarity.Here comes some severely sad cynical prediction: 30 years from now these songs will be in commercials for products aimed at wealthy people wanting to tap into a mispent youth they never really reveled in, nor truly enjoyed.I guess we'll see."
0," Good space saver...doesn't open very well: The spice rack is a great space saver in the kitchen. However, it is VERY difficult to open. When you can finally force it open, it often dumps the spices out."
1, frodo: my great grandchildren are just discovering these movies.. to us they are the classic j.r. tolkin tales and the music is great much better than the new movie
1," works as advertised: It holds panels well but I feel holding a heavy one in that position a little cumbersome, but I haven't found anything better"
1," Real life happenings. Totally enjoyed it!: I totally enjoyed this book. I've experienced a church setting like the one written about in this book. But my eyes are still focused on God, in spite of humans, and our issues. Church is what you make it; your motive for being there."
0," crap: This set includes a lot of irrelevant information ie..overly detailed information about computer terms like RAM. But, the other stuff that is specific to starting a cleaning business is not there. I seriously doubt the authors have any experience in this industry. This will NOT get you ready to start a cleaning business. Most of the other information is common sense This thing appears as if were written with very little or no research."
1," DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!: To the person who wrote the Stones were poking fun at ""let it be"" (with their masterpiece ""Let It Bleed"") Only one problem - LET IT BLEED was out BEFORE ""let it be"""
0, Author doesn't care if series is ever finished: On his website he has answered all those asking why the next installment is a year overdue. After whining about missing several conventions in order to work on the book he refers to his readers as trolls. I guess only those who worship him are worthy. It seems the man is too in love with himself to bother with the trolls who have made him rich.Think twice before investing your time and money with this egotistical jerk. He obviously has no idea what to do with his story. I have serious doubts as to his ability to finish this series as he seems to be more interested in other projects than finishing what he started.
1," UPDATE on the Ossuary Authenticity: Since the book was written, and after many of the reviews were written, the ossuary has been found, indeed, to have been a genuine ossuary with forged writing. It is no longer supposed the final resting place of the bones of St. James the Just, brother of Jesus.Of course, one may still profitably read the story of the ossuary, and review some of the debate over its authenticity, as presented in the book; it forms a recent history about science of the antiquities, and about human foibles.The second half of the book, an introduction to James, is entirely unrelated to the ossuary. It forms a good overall introduction, easier to take in than several of the other, scholarly tomes -- some of which are even more challenging regarding the quest for the truth story of James."

1," Pretty good machine: I've always believed in the maxim, anything that can be done by a machine, should be done by a machine. Human effort should be reserved for meaningful activity. Washing out a coffee maker is not meaingful; watching the wildlife while sipping good coffee is. This device is a snap to use; it makes good coffee; and, best of all, requires an absolute minimum of cleaning."
1," beautiful, tragic Jean: This is my third time reading this fascinating portrait of a lovely screen presence. I highly recommend this haunting story of a haunted, underrated star. Also, try to see Bonjour Tristesse. The French Riviera is almost as beautiful as Jean herself, accompanied by the great Deborah Kerr and excellent David Niven."
0," dissapointing....: Bought this as a birthday present for my 10 year old son. This was the only item he asked for. That was June! Still no activity. This is a waste of money! I am so dissapointed in this product. I can't believe nothing happened. On top of that, this was his birthday present!"
1," Magical movie + David Bowie = Timeless Classic: I first watched this movie when I was about 10, and I was totally blown away. It was in the old VHS format, and I never got tired of seeing it, enjoying it as much as I did the first time. Fast-forward some 15 years, when on a whim I decided to re-watch it just to see whether it would stand the test of time. I'm very happy to say that this is one of those (relatively rare) movies that never gets old!I've seen it many times as an adult, and I like it just as much as I did when I was a fairy-story-obsessed kid. David Bowie's flawless performance as the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly's beautiful, headstrong Sarah are the biggest reasons I never get tired of this movie, but Jim Henson's puppets and the magical challenges of the Labyrinth itself is what makes a good story become unforgettable. A must-see!As an aside, I admit I've had a long crush on David Bowie ever since I first watched this movie at age 9 or 10. See it, and you'll see why! :)"
1, The large book on vacation: When I am traveling I cannot carry large books. To have the book on Kindle is to have the book in a convenient form to enjoy it. THE SOURCE by Michener is large enough that one book lasts a long time.
1," Excellent within its scope: This is an excellent book for gardeners in USDA Zones 3b through 5b east of the 100th meridian. While one can certainly quarrel with which genera are covered, within its scope this book offers very solid advice. No similar reference offers as much breadth regarding specific cultivars. I hope the publisher will offer an expanded (including Thalictrums and Polygonatums!) and updated second edition in the near future. If you are a beginning to intermediate gardener this book is definitely worth having."
0," cook unevenly and easily stick.....: Since you can't flip it, it does not cook evenly if you don't load enough batter in. That of course is not a major problem compares to the stickiness...... We just can't stand how easily it sticks and how inconvenient to clear it afterward. So we return it after the first day, what a disappointment........"
1, K & H lector-soft heated outdoor bed: The heated bed was exactly what I expected. I've owned it for a couple months and still working properly and my outside cat loves it!
0, bad idea: sounded like a quick easy fix problem is it dosent work.all it did was leave a waxy residue on wood didnt remove scratch at all
0," Get the Sunbeam/Oster instead: I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It's bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don't latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you're one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I'll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!"
1," Coroner Hits All The Right Notes: The hardest Coroner album for me to find is also my personal favorite. This one has the best production, strangest lyrics, and outstanding production (although the vocals seem a bit buried in the mix. The only weak track is the cover of the Beatles' ""I Want You (She's So Heavy) which, if not great, is at least tolerable (unlike the ""Purple Haze cover on Punishment For Decadence). A definite easy (and intelligent) choice for the new-to-Coroner listener."
0, Life of Pi: I love this story and had read it before but given it away. This edition has a terrible ugly thick font and was done on the cheap and is not a pleasure to read as a result.
0, If you like pages that are off centered and if it does not bother that if jams more pages than it prints: then buy this jalopy. You can get it at Office Max for 129....about the price off a new set of toners. I am going to take my Beretta and shoot this pile of junk as soon as it runs out of toner.
0, Horrible!!!: I was tempted with buying a new blender since the one I have now is 15 years old and plastic. I wanted one that could crush ice to make margaritas in the summer. Sold by the name and the fact it said it would crush ice for drinks I spent the $100. In 1 year I've used this machine because each time I do I'm thoroughly disgusted on its performance. It does not crush ice but makes this block in the blender. It was difficult in making pesto and I finally decided to get rid of it when it couldn't blend hummus! I'm not a novice cook or a pro chef but I have gone back to my 15 year old machine.
1, U.S. Marshals: If you want action then buy this movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes put a lot of excitement in this movie. This worth buying.
0," Don't Waste Your Time: If you want to waste a portion of your day being soul-numbingly bored and dissatisfied, I highly urge you to watch this movie. I enjoy short films, but this stretched my patience too far. With the exception of ""The Job"" each of these short films are pointless drivel. Adding insult to injury, before each film are commercials and previews that undermine the whole concept of independent films. This DVD was an experience in dissatisfaction."
0," So disappointed.: The best part about this movie is the real twin interviews at the beginning and end which isn't even part of the actual movie. The rest was a let down in my opinion. I love Adam Sandler but this movie sucked. There were so many talented people in it and it still sucked.On a side note, Al Pacino is a hack and couldn't act if he tried. He is the same character in every movie, how is that acting?"
1," i and i love the heart of a lion: i was first introduced to this album around three years ago when, as a junior in college, i went abroad to england to study for a semester. one of my english classmates invited me to his house and in showing me his music collection put on i-roy's heart of a lion. i knew then, even after listening to the first track, that i had to purchase the album. i looked for it at the local stores but was not able to find it. fortunately, i was able to pick it up shortly after returning to the states. this album is a gem. the dub is awesome!!! the bass-line and horn...the drums...and of course, i-roy lyrically kicks reason to i and i mind. it is also a good album to skank to or simply relax with.my favorite tracks are: heart of a lion, sister nelly(so good!!!), camas town, catty rock, and tiddle le bop.what are you doing? run to your local reggae outlet and get it!peace and love"
1," A Classic Love Story That Deserved More Praise: I can't believe this movie didn't get better reviews from critics, Runaway Bride has practically the same plot line and got loads of praise, but this one got[pardon the pun] run over by a dumpster. It shouldn't have. The storyline is typical, but so what? They all are. Jennifer Lopez is fabulous as Mary, I loved the character she played. Matthew McConaughey, while not because of his looks, is definitely leading-man material, he has a such charm and grace that isn't found in most movies lately.It's a cute story that is definitely humerous at times, a must-see if you like comedies like Runaway Bride."
0, bad construction: This was a nice color but was constructed poorly and would not stay together. Couldn't use it and had to send it back.
1," I liked it alot: This film was well done. Without ever once bringing religion into it, it covered the discussion of Free Will vs Destiny as it relates to two people in love.Someone may quibble over the one mention of angels but seriously not once did I feel like any one was proselytizing for any viewpoint over another. Delightfully refreshing in this time of polarization and fanatacism.Watch it and decide for your self. I plan to buy this one for my library."
0, Very simple plot: The characters are unreal and the plot is simple. I don't find the book exciting at all although it is not yet being rated boring.
0, Short lifespan: These Energizers just don't last very many charge cycles. My other brand of rechargable NIMH batteries last and last. It has happened over several packs so I just don't buy them anymore. I figured they would be at least as good as the other name brands but they simply aren't.
0," What the hell.....: I had high hopes for this movie from the very start. The retro shot back to 1968 to start the mood and the ""myth"" that surrounds the entire story (which has real potential if it wasn't so poorly acted). The acting is the major problem with this movie. I will admit, the ending was no shocker. I loved Justin Long in JEEPER'S CREEPERS, but in this he was as weak as he could be...nothing. The real problem lies with the lead...Alison Lohman, she is dreadful. You have absolutely no connection with her character. She is just going through the motions. No development, no empathy, no sympathy, no hatred, no nothing. She is one-dimensional and that is the real disaster of this movie. As I stated, I felt the story line had potential, with perhaps a bit more polishing of the script, but definitely with another lead actress in the role."
1," Reminds us how great this music was!: Miles purists often curl their lips at the churning, chaotic funk of his early seventies music, but Smith and Kaiser's CD (amazing value for money, a double for $20 or so) is a sharp reminder of how this primal roar captured the spirit of an era and paved the way for so much modern music. Highspots are the demented sax ensembles and solos, Kaiser's dead-on wah-and-graunch guitar stylings, and Smith's eerie grasp of what Miles was trying to do, but sometimes undershot. From the get-go, it doesn't sound like an imitation, but more of a tribute. Minor quibbles: Kaiser should have tossed the cheesy guitar-rack sitar effects and used a real sitar. And Smith plays just a bit too clean. But anyone who loved Miles will flip over this CD. And those who didn't, or were too young to get it: Hold on to your hats. This is the real classical music of the late 20th century."
0," Attention Everybody.: Look, half of you who gave this book 1 star or 2 stars, you only did because of the Amazon shipment. What does that have to do with Harry Potter? And secondly, I have read all the Harry Potter books and I found them all terrible except for the fourth which is definitely (by far) the best one. Harry Potter, in my opnion, is meh...."
1," An essential read!: The best of visionary fiction on the surface of the globe today! Probably, the deepest n the shortest masterpiece of our times!A terrific write! Totally, awe-inspiring! All you need is a terrific mind to stand this awesome work! And for all those blessed with the same,this book is an essential read! Because it can bring to you the most self-transforming experience of your life!"
1," THESE GUYS ARE GREAT: Just wanted to add more words about these guys.. I have been listening to these guys for awhile now. I started listening to them when they were still considered a ""local band"" playing at the Ridglea Theater. A friend of mine turned me on to this group and I have been following and listening ever since. They are not only VERY talented guys but they are very nice and always try to find time to talk to the fans. Not many groups are as open to fans as these guys are. Oh and just incase Roon reads this. Dude I still have the guitar pick you gave me after one of the shows at The Ridglea, thanks again for that. Check these guys out if you haven't already. And you wil understand why myself and the other fans think Element Eighty is so great."
0," Worst reception ever: I love the look and style of this phone, but by far it has the WORST reception I've ever heard. I am CONSTANTLY dropping calls, and there can be very bad interference/static on my calls. I thought this was just a fluke, complained to AT&T (when it still was) and they sent me a new phone. Still having all the same problems!! The camera is probably below average aswell. Though this is an older phone and I don't expect people to be buying it, I warn you, don't!!"
0," Use it as a coaster - that's all it's good for.: Most expensive coaster I've ever purchased.Extremely disappointed. Jagged Little Pill was wonderful - expressive, passionate, and moving. This CD, however, is mind-numbing, irritating, and worst of all boring. One track Thank U held my attention, the others were just ""noise"". Has she been to India lately? If that's what she was trying to immitate, perhaps she should have written lyrics for a talented Indian artist and saved herself some embarressment. Thank goodness she sold enough copies of Jagged Little Pill to have a comfortable existance -- this could only sell to those who are truly ""Infatuation Junkies"" of Alanis."
0, GPS function: I travel 80% of the time for my job. MapPoint 2001 gives me the ability to get directions offline. The software advertise NMEA 0183 version 2.0 use on GPS units. Microsoft gives an address and the company said that it has no idial why Microsoft is directing people to there website. The software package would be worth it if it was truly compatiable with GPS units that can be attached to laptops.
0," Buy the singles & wait for the next remix CD: On this album, J-Lo's voice sounds strangely tweaked. You might not be able to notice it that much though since most of the singing is from backup singers. Miss Lopez is definitely not someone who should be singing slow love songs. The two singles that are already played out on the radio are the only tracks worth listening to. During every other song I just sat there and waited for an exciting break from the droning, maybe an actual chorus or a guest singer. But nothing. The word nothing basically sums up the entire album. I must say I'm dissapointed."
0, Clips unsatisfactory.: These clips do not fit tight enough on the flag pole. As a result the two clips do not stay apart causing the flag to bunch up.
1," Handy & good value: A very handy pot for sauce making, particularly if you need to reduce liquids quicly. The shape allows easy access for a whisk, spoon, spatula etc. The pan heats quickly and evenly. Because it's not as heavy as high-end (i.e., expensive) pans it doesn't retain heat as well, so you have to use some additional care in use; but, if you're making sauces, you're probably standing over the pan the whole time anyway, so this is a minor quibble.The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is: 1) the handle is spot welded on rather than riveted, and, 2) it's not as thick as the very top of the line sauce pans (Falk, All-clad, etc) and may not take as much abuse over time. If you plan to use this as one of the workhorse pans in your kitchen, then consider buying a heavier saucier with a riveted handle (but you'll spend a LOT more).But, if you're like me and most home cooks, this pan will be just fine for everyday use, and the price can't be beat for a pan of this quality."
0, Disappointing at Best: If you have spent any time as a manager in a large corporation then skip this book. There is nothing in here that you don't all ready know. Some tidbits from the text on how to make it to the top:1. You must work more than 40 hours a week.2. You must be politically savvy.3. You must voice your opinion.4. Don't play the victim... Be accountable for your mistakes.If you aren't doing these things all ready then you probably wouldn't be interested in a book like this anyway. A great concept that falls short on substance.
1, Awesome! A rare gem: This is an awesome collection of stuff that is actually out there!! It's cut up and random at best.. but it's such a true document!
1, Easy serve air pot: Probably bigger than I needed but is a great product and I really like it. Would recommend to anyone.
1," pretty good show, if you like Downton Abbey: I tried this show because I had finished the Downtown Abbey series. It's not as deep or richly detailed as Downtown, but still a lot of fun to watch. Wish there were more episodes available, though."
0," A Horrible Look at University-Level Debating: This movie attempts to portray the world of university level debate, and does a poor job at that. As a Parliamentary debater myself, I can assure you of this being an extremely poor interpritation. In the big final round before the Supreme Court for instance, the debaters use opinion as argumentation using brilliant lines as ""abortion is wrong because God says so"" and relaying a personal story about getting an abortion, all of which are totally irrelevant. Abortion is also pretty much not debated on any circuit because the arguements are cliche (much like this movie), and no one's opinion is changed. Even given the poor debate, the acting is miserable, and the storyline is dull and uninventive. I strongly suggest steering clear of ""Listen to Me"", unless you just want a good laugh at a poor attempt at film ;-)."
0, Broke after 3 uses: I bought 2 airzookas for my 9 year old twins. This one broke on 3rd try- the plastic came undone- probably can be fixed but not sure how to secure the plastic again...
0," less than sufficient: Cartridge that came was a refilled, non hp cartridge. I used it for one day, then my printer kept giving me an error message and wouldn't work. I still ended up having to spend $25 on a new one and this one isn't worth keeping as a backup."
0," Sergeant's sliver sequeeze-on for cats and kittens: I rate this product as being very very poor, as it does not work. My cat's fleas are worst and have treated several times with this application as well as give them a bath. It does not work and is a waste of money."
0," DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS SOOO NOT WELL BUILT!: I GOT THIS AND IT FELT REALLLY LOOSE AND STUFF AND IT DIDNT WORK! ITS A VERY UNRELIABLE PRODUCT. OH AND THE VOLUME IS SUPER LOUD ON IT EVEN IF YOUR COMPUTER VOLUME IS LOW."
0," so bad its comical: This movie is the ""WORST"" movie I have ever seen in my life.Its so bad that I believe the director of this film committed suicide.I don't want to go into the storyline because there is'nt any."
0," The First Russophobe: In this book Mr. Reich uses a popular method of getting ahead in literary life: scribble away a bunch of russophobic babble and hope for the best. Did it work? Well, with jewels like ""cut Russian's insides before he drops like a sack of potatoes"" who could be in the miss?!? Did he call himself civilized?Did Mr. Reich have to pay to get this smeared toilet paper published? Will never know as it's probably privileged information. Right, Mr. Accountant?While he ceaselessly tries to be just a little more like DeMille, Clancy, and even Wolfe (almost entire passages copied out of The Bonfire), he ain't it. Escaped crazy Russkies on their own fighter jet? Is that his biggest masturbation fantasy, or is it the one about a sack of potatoes? Shed some light on this in your next one, - will definitely be a bestseller this time. Right."
0," Shocked: I couldn't believe it when only a few small pieces of the stand arrived (in a very large box) It didn't even resemble a stand! The top, all of the legs, three of the feet and two side braces were all missing.I was pleased, however, with Amazon's return policy."
1," Good Tunes: I like this album. My only thing is that the songs that are hits on this album are the best songs, and there's only 3 or 4 of those. They rocked, but the whole album isn't solid. I would still buy this cd over and over though."
0," Disappointed: I am a new user to PhotoImpact, so after reading the reviews here, I purchased the book. A picture is worth a thousand words..well, the illustrations in this book are the worse I have ever seen...you can hardly read the lettering on the illustrations...even the illustrations are fuzzy. I am so very disappointed."
1," Oops. I got an abridged book by mistake: The worst thing I can say about this audio book is that it wasn't long enough. I mistakenly bought an abridged book. The storyline, characters, and plot development were such that I would have loved to read the entire thing. What there was of it, though, I really enjoyed."
1," Breath Taking---An voice that is unmistakable: From start to finish you will be amazed with a voice that is not engineered like todays artist. I am in the age group as the Britney Spears and I can tell you they don't have the soul resounding voice like the Deneice Williams, the Anita Bakers, Patti Labelle,the Arethas, the Whitney's,the Janet, the Celine and Mariah whose music are long lasting and classics. ""Silly"", ""You're All that Matters"",""I am So Proud"", ""When Love Comes Calling"" ""Its Gonna Take A Miracle"", ""Free"" are songs that evokes emotions that we all experience some point in our lifetime and its an album worth owning. The Simple titles of each song leaves your heart wanting more, especially the simplicity of ""I am so Proud"" embodies what you feel about someone else accomplishments other than your own. And I can say ""I am proud"" of Deniece Williams for giving that soulful voice to world to hear. Get it along with her Two Greatest Hits album and Guarantee you will not be dissappointed."
1," A winner: This movie is utterly charming. It is a wonderful spoof on The Pirates of Penzance (another favorite) without belittleing the other. The acting is terrific and the music is very ""love songs from the 80s""ish. One that I can watch time and time again without growing tired of it."
1," Awesome Movie: Saw this in theaters with our kids. We all loved the movie, Disney has found thier magic again. I have read some of the critial reviews talking about the dark side to the film. I remind everyone that many of Disney's classics have a dark side as well (Snow White, Black Cauldron, Sleeping Beauty, and more). Overall the movie was delightful and fun, a lot of good teaching moments and laughs."
0, product description is inaccurate: I purchased this product (X 2) for $15.96 each. the description claimed that 24 markers were included. In actuality only 8 markers were included. the identical product was on sale at Target for $6.99. The only reason I did not return it was because of the hassle involved. I am very disappointed that I could not trust the description posted.
0," The Women: Dont even bother watching. Meg ryans acting, betrayed by hubbie was so unbelievable. I think all these star women got together and tried to prove themselves but they fell flat. They showed how untalented they really are."
0," Not quite beauty...just pain: This album was a disappointment for me. I'm not a kid...I've been a fan of superchick for a few years now (since LOP). Tracks 1,3,7,and 10 are alright...the rest are filler. Track 9, Courage sounds pretty bad.HLR"
1," great organizer for home and work!: I am an attorney with two small children and I find the Busybodybook a great way to keep track of my professional commitments and my children's schedules. I particularly love the to do list page with extra room for notes and reminders -- I can put down something I know needs to be done three weeks from now on the appropriate page and then carry foward any items that didnt get done in previous weeks. The grid system helps me see at a glance who needs to be where on a given day. I leave the last column for reminders of events that we might be interested in doing, but are not appointments/commitments (such as street fairs, lectures, art exhibits,etc.)"
0," DONT buy this IF UR A GAMER: dont buy this piece of junk its so bad when i play my games my the w button dosent work some times to move foward and i have to press it really hard the mouse it nice and all and i like the online and media buttons but is not goo for gaming i had a logtech mx 700 elite due and that was great and i really like that but the mouse broke so i had to throw it out well all and all this is a bad keyboard cant belive i wasted my money and it not very durable, so if u get angry when u play games dont get it because i baged on it and the flip up thing broke and now i have to return it and get a new one"
0, Broke Before I could Wear It!: I hoard unique jewelery so naturally this was right up my alley. I tried it on when it came in the mail and it fit fine. I went to wear it yesterday for the first time and it broke right in the middle (just opposite the adjustable part) I was really upset! I guess because it's adjustable it can't take that much tension and it snapped. I LOVE the way it looks so I am going to try and melt it back together but I would have definitely returned it if the return shipping wasn't so ridiculous. SAD =[
0, Highly Disappointed: I am a big fan of train videos. Especially ones that show scenic views of this great country. I have an older video of this same area that is just as clear or better. After viewing this much anticipated video I was really disapointed with the quality of the video. In this day of high definition video one has to wonder why there are so many companies getting away with riping of the customer like this one does. I'd sooner pay double to get a real high def video. I'll have to do more homework before I buy any more like this one.Eric V.
0," not loving Mixed Chicks leave in!: I tried the leave in conditioner 2 times on my biracial little girl's hair and was not too impressed. this product is good if you wash and detangle daily. but after 1 day, hair is dry and tangled. my daughter's hair is mostly straight with a slight wave and curly ends. gel from $ store and water works better for us then this stuff. won't waste my money on it again. this company ignore moisture needs completely"
0," didn't work: Sounds great-two computers on one mouse, keyboard and monitor. Only the monitor feature would recognize. This devise never saw the keyboard or mouse. After two hours of ""following the simple steps"" I trashed it. Forget about trying to return it as defective. The consumer is always the one that is in error."
0," Read ""Through the Eyes of Spirit"" by Jenny Crawford: ""Reaching to Heaven"" just dosn't seem real somehow!I suggest you read Jenny Crawford's book - ""Through the Eyes of Spirit"" to truly feel the presence and love of those in the spirit world.James Van Praagh's book ""Reaching to Heaven"" sounds a bit stretched in detail to me."
0, Struggled through each page: This book is awful. I had to read it for an American Literature class and I could barely make it through it. Maybe white people are devils but she could have expressed these thoughts more creatively. This book sucks-try again Leslie.
1," Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML: This is one of my new resolutions for the new year, to learn HTML, CSS and XHTML to be comfortable building my own website.This seems a very easy to follow book, for ""dummies"" like me, who have no idea of these things. I don't want my grand-kids to make fun of me because I was born before the computers' era. :)"
0," Hard to navigate/unsearchable: I wish I could type in the scripture reference I am looking for and it would pop up, but this format of the NIV Bible doesn't work that way. You have to go all the way back to the Table of Contents and scroll through the long list of books until you find the one you want. Then you have to scroll through the long list of chapters until you find the one you want. For at church or in a Bible study setting, this version is terrible. It would be faster to flip through an actual printed Bible to find the scripture you're looking for. If you are specifically looking for a quick-look-up-type Bible, this is not the one you want."
1," Solid Music from San Francisco Indie Ing: Ing are one of those indie bands that you continually seek-out because you know you're never going to be disappointed with the results. ""Liberty"" is the second CD I've acquired, their first being the slightly more modest (but equally entertaining) ""First Version of the Wheel."" This is likely due to the fact that the band has doubled its members and is now a quartet. ""Liberty"" starts out in trademark Ing-stylee with ""Confusion""- a track that, if you only read the lyrics, would appear to be woeful and lethargic. In fact, the opposite is true- the track pours with sunlight and chipper ambivalence. Very SoCal. Other standout tracks include ""Inside Out"", ""Drop"" and ""Good Friday"". My one complaint is that the songs go by very quickly, and the album is a tad short. Still, if you like bands with strong lyrics, good tunes and that still have their souls, Ing is a good place to start."
1," Good product for many uses.: I use this for my garage door. Came home a couple times to an open door, and figured someone else nearby had one on the same channel, or some guy was driving down the street in his car hitting the button. Installed this in the loop and I don't have to buy an expensive new secure opener.Cons,must depress and hold button for one second.Range low, 25ft is about max, and that's through a wood door, not a metal one.Taken together, it's a cheap reliable solution to, what was for me, an expensive problem."
1," Fun game: My kids had this when they were a kid. My daughter thought my granddaughter would like it since she had seen it at day care. She is 2 3/4 years old. She couldn't wait for the adults to figure out how to put it together (which was simple, we just weren't paying attention). Now that's all I hear in the background when I call her house. She plays it constantly and understands the concept of it. Can't go wrong with toys the younger ones grew up with and remember how much fun it was. Thanks for keeping this toy out there."
0," Ava Adore is good, but the 2 other songs aren't that good.: Ava Adore is a really good song. Great rhythm and lyrics. However, the 2 other songs are very slow. I was expecting the B-sides to Ava Adore a little similar to it. If you like the song Ava Adore, I suggest you buy the album ""Adore"" because it has a lot of good tracks. It's worth the $$$."
1, Kids love these plates: These plates are great and the kids love them! I have a 2 and a 5 year old and now I don't have to worry about feeding them on the plastic kids plates. I can just throw them in the dishwasher and they are much easier to take care of.
1," excellent book for both scholars and the lay reader: as a student in russia and eastern european studies, Tuller's book casts much needed light on the stuggles of gays and lesbians in Russia. it has helped me to more fully understand the russian mind and soul. thank you"
0," It's not that easy...: I bought this to help me plan a simple model railroad plan for the basement. The amount of work that it takes just to figure out all of the nodes of this software makes it impractical at best, and a waste of money at worst. In the time that it takes to build this digitally, you could do better to do the planning manually and actually learn more.It is not a game. It is supposed to be a model railroad build software tool of which it is a poor one."
0," Do Not Buy.: I'm usually one who enjoys a book that centers on a deep meaningful subject, but this one missed the mark. I have never been so disappointed in an ending in my entire life. And I don't mean the actual story ending (which lacked anything special as well) but the last pages of supposed empowering quotes. No book tells someone to make cut until it bleeds and don't stop until it hurts whether literal or figurative.I actually finished this book in the hopes that all the chapters would eventually mold into one powerful story centered around the bonds of friendship. Don't get me wrong, I can handle difficult subject manner, but only when it is written well and with meaning. This book was an author's sorry attempt to change the face of real life, hardcore, female literature...I burned this book after I read it."
0," Smelly -- deceptive marketing: This cot was purchased new, but was delivered smelling like a campfire. Unfortunaltely we thought we could air it out. Well we left it on a screened porch open fully. After 2 weeks it still smelled. We couldn't get it back in it's package so we still have it. This seller IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY! This cot was not new. The cot itself is great. Just buy it from a different vender. It is hard to finish the last step of set up and requires an exceptionally strong person and a hammer."
1," ARRESTING CAST AND PRODUCTION VALUES MAKE FOR THE BEST!: Just the facts, ma'm: ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" is the best damn cop show in TV history. Period. End of story. The evidence: this must-have DVD collection, containing all the arresting grit and grime and jittery camera work and jarring jump cuts, of the show's first two seasons. Brought to the small screen by Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson, Tom Fontana and Paul Attanasio, the series boasts one of the a tight, razor-sharp cast --- headed by Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Andre Braugher and Yaphet Kotto --- that helped redefine police dramas ... and then rewrite that definition over and over again. The special tracks are a welcome addition, including in-depth interviews with Levinson and Fontana, cast and crew bios, pilot episode commentary, even the Super Bowl XXVII commercials. Book it! Now."
0," A formula without excitement.: I did not like this book at all. It is a basic formula... landless knight marries wealthy heiress. Of course, relatively speaking, all romance novels are a formula to a degree. It is the twists on the plot that the author can offer and the creation of characters that are dear to the reader that makes the book different and one worth remembering.I found that I did not care about either Rose or Dominic. They were entirely too one-dimensional. The story did not build suspense and as stated, it is merely a simple formula. There is the obigatory spurned lover who stirs up trouble and the villian from which the hero must save the heroine, but again, it simply did not hold my interest. On the plus side, Ms. Mason does a good job of creating passionate and sexy love scenes, but overall, this was not enough to hold my interest."
1," Muy Buena Produccion: La Produccion quedo muy buena desde el punto de vista tecnico. Tambien David Reynoso y Josias Piña hicieron un trabajo excelente con los arreglos, y como siempre, los musicos estan de primera clase. La voz de Josue se mantiene viva para la Gloria de Dios!!"
1," guess how much i love this book: we have two children who are four and six years old, probably around the same age of your children if you are looking at the prospect of buying this book. born and raised in manhattan, i happen to be bilingual and have been teaching our children spanish from birth -- no easy task but an enriching one. Out of all the books i've purchased -- many which are duds with poor illustration and content -- adivina cuanto te quiero is by far their favorite spanish day and bedtime story. i thank the publisher and that adorable long eared bunny for making my task so much easier and pleasurable!"
1, I LOVE THIS SONG!!! brilliant way to come out to the world!!: kelis came out of nowhere with this song.... i love this song to death because it is like a revenge song and she is screamin through the whole song!!!! and i love it to death...i have never heard a song like this... the neptunes are brilliant... i like their style of video game sounds mixed with african drums with a hint of rock....kelis is different from the other female artist because she does not have to holler high notes through songs just so she can get a point through (i.e. beyonce)...this is a brilliant song and i think this song should have done better on the charts and the listeners because it was sooo different... i recommend this song to anyone tha likes something different...5.5 stars out of 5 non-stop brilliance
1," greta mini torch, the best I had so far.: The only thing that bothers me is the aluminum body gets hot after a while when using it for an extended period of time, that makes me a bit nervous so I set it aside to cool down. Other than that it is pretty safe, unlike the cheap plastic ones which, look like they can fall apart at any moment, the Blazer is well built and sturdy. It will take use and abuse and still work fine."
0," Becareful: I will say it I love the game and will probably always will... but I cannot stand the business practices of SOE. So if you love Star Wars and want to try the game go for it, but keep a wary eye... it seems each time people start to have fun again with the game SOE revamps it."
1," Not Smith's best, but still good.: Of course this is not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn; matching that would be an impossible feat. But it is still an interesting look into the life of a young woman in early 20th century Brooklyn. Yes, it's sometimes depressing; so is life. Smith's point in all of her novels is that there is always hope. Dignity can be found in the seemingly least important lives, and life's joys and sorrows are shared by us all."
0," Get what you pay for: I was not expecting these to be great headphones, and they aren't. The sound quality is not that great. There is some scratchiness for certain melodies and notes. For example, Jason Mraz doesn't sound too good. The Black Eyed Peas, however, sound fine. The earcups are not very comfortable, and ear fatigue occurs in less than an hour. That said, the sound quality is better than the tin-like sound that comes out of the laptop speakers. The cups seal decently and this helps minimize exterior noises. The cord plug is plenty long, which is an improvement over my old ipod earbuds. My main impetus for purchasing these was to get an alternative to the earbuds, and they manage that fairly well. If you can find a $20-something model with good reviews, that might be a better purchase. These are what they are. I'm still undecided on whether it was a good purchase or not. Also, I haven't used the larger adaptor plug, so I can't comment on how well that works."
1," You will never look at a 14-year old at a computer-keyboard the same again.: Michael Lewis has yet to disappoint.A fun read with dramatic implications. Like 'Future Shock', 'In Search of Excellence' it is great for gaining perspective leading up to an event years or decades later through the lens of history."
1," Entertaining Coffeemaker: I really like this coffee maker, and it is entertaining as well. Fresh ground coffee and the weather, what could be easier. The signal is lost quite a bit, but that may be because of where I live. This coffeemaker replaces another Melitta I used for 6 years, and is even easier to use. I love it!"
0," If you like endless accounts of who will fight whom...: This started out great, with developed characters, Prospero and his daughter, and an intriguing and powerful sorcerer. Unfortunately it became an endless exploration of who was on whose side, who was going to fight whom and why, and what the political consequences would be. Characterization is fine, but this is anything but ""character driven."" It's another exploration of an author's imaginary world. Well-written, but became too boring At about page 100, I skimmed to page 200 - no change, same things going on. I won't finish it."
0," Fair...not great: There certainly is a lot of information in this book, and I found it occasionally useful, but as a study aid it failed me. It was easier to copy Japanese from textbooks onto notecards than study this book, and for looking up Japanese, a real dictionary is far superior."
1," All good things...: Possibly the best animated series in years wraps up in style in this final season of Justice League Unlimited. Although short at only 13 episodes, it does give fans what they have been looking for with a show-down between an updated Legion of Doom and the entire membership of the JLU. The two-part finale brings forth an epic showdown with a surprise villain, and nearly all of the heroes get some screen time. Overall, a great end to the series."
1, Neat!: Thanks for your promptness. It arrived on time and was just what our grandgirl wanted for her birthday. You made her very happy.
0," OK, but save your money and check it out at the library: This book was mildly funny, moderately accurate and majorly crude. Save your money - it's a pretty shallow read."
1," a GrEat Sci-fi nOvEL.: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *This is a great book! I'm not even all that into sci-fi novels, but I still enjoyed this book completly. It is very origanal and I can't think of another book with even a similar plot.After aliens attack the earth twice the government breeds military genisus and sends them to a military school at a young age, where they don't see their parents until they graduate. They play war games, and work their way up to toon leaders and finnaly command their own armies. The armies fight in zero gravity games. When they graduate they are sent to different schools, such as command school. Ender Wiggins is just a boy, but he is expected to be the next genius to save earth. His life is shaped by the teachers at the battle school.I just finished this book the other day, and I can't wait to get the sequel. This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I recomend it to anyone over twelve years of age!"
1," the sleeping beauty: In spite of what other people may think, in my oppinion, this is a very good dvd.It is very old,andtechnology wansn't then what it is now.Leaving that apart, where else can you see Margot Fonteyn dancing her most famous role?.Nobody has equal let alone surpass her in that role.Forget the technology and concentrate in the beauty of her dancing."
1, Great introduction to a legal procedure: Demystifies the deposition and breaks it down to common sense principles. A must for anyone who is representing themselves.
1," Super: A very well written and produced Christian entertainment package. I saw the production live back in the 80's and Tom Key is tremendous. The others are great as well. Was so happy when it came out on DVD. I would recommend Cotton Patch Gospel to everyone. You will laugh and you will be moved to tears, you will be humming or singing the tunes for weeks, you will be moved and you will learn there are many ways to show God's love."
0," The program crashed after being done with the Interview: I have been using TurboTax since it first became available. But this year I decided not to use it due to its forcefull installation of Internet explorer 5.5 and the problems that this can create in your system (up to total system failure). I went ahead and bought TaxCut Deluxe. After spending two days completing the interview process, when I'm finally done I click next and the program crashes. Luckily I have Windows 2000 and it intercepts the crash of the software and it even provides you with a log file with the exact reason the software crashed. After emails with their customer support and phone calls (pretty good support), they acknowledged they had a problem and that they don't have a solution. I was told to ask for a refund. But who will refund me for my time??? Nevertheless, when compared to the customer service of other companies (i.e. Pinnacle) it was really great."
1," A great book for independent thinkers worldwide!!!: This book leads to the ultimate conclusion that mankind has and can be easily manipulated through a small elite of intellectuals. The various religious books point out that if the ""Gods"" are not obeyed mankind will suffer the consequences of the wrath of the ""Gods"" who usually employ secret societies that control the world to do their bidding. These religious books do have spirituallity but ultimately promote totalitarianism under the guise of ""The kingdom of Heaven"" where everybody obeys and doesn't question authority. You don't have to believe the book, but it's worth researching and thinking about. Pick it up you, wouldn't be dissappointed!"
1," Excellent hairspray!: I have very thick, very curly hair, and over the years I've tried countless hairsprays to help keep my mop under control. My problem with sprays was always that they either didn't provide enough hold or else they made my hair stiff as a helmet. Hands-down, this Garnier Flexible Control spray is the best middle-ground I've ever found: the spray goes on light and doesn't leave my hair feeling crunchy, yet it keeps it under good control (and the ""anti-humidity"" claim is absolutely true: this spray keeps my curls from frizzing even in the height of super-muggy New England summers). It also has a pleasant, fruity scent, and it's very affordable -- especially compared to higher-priced salon sprays that don't work half as well. Highly recommended!"
0," Someone has to be in the minority: I found this book boring, convoluted, and very easy to put down. The book did not keep my interest, and I only finished it, because I finish all books. I am in the correct age group, but seem to not like the type of self-absorbed characters in this book. The make-up of the family is changing and this book does not fit in with my life, or the lives of the people and families in my life."
1," An important piece of the John Lyons Picture: John teaches concept as much as technique and that is important. John encourages you consider broad principals and define your goals. Having participated in several symposiums and a clinic, most of everything I do was influenced by John Lyons and this book was an important part of that. The foundation for training my own Andalusian Stallion is largely based on concepts from this book. I believe you also need two important videos by John: ""Round Pen Reasoning"" and ""Leading and Loading"". John never claims to be the only enlightened trainer, but in my view he is one of the best. You can dedicate a lifetime to learning about horses, and this book is a great starter. But in the end, you will learn the most from your horse not from other books. I believe John would agree."
1," At Last a Truly Sensible Tarot Guide: After perusing dozens of books on Tarot, finally here is a book that makes sense! Well organized, straight-forward, and informative, it is far and away the most useful Tarot guide I have ever seen. It imparts common sense, helpful perspectives, and indepth insights, all of which are organized in a logical and easy-to-use format. Although the author uses the Rider-Waite deck, his learning system is easily adapted to other deck styles. If this guide does not help you to learn or improve your Tarot skills, it may be that you should reconsider Tarot and go on to knitting . . ."
1, Excellent Insight and Information: I found this book to be full of helpful and interesting facts and insights into a people I consider to be fascinating and inspiring.
0, Item Never Recieved and no contacT from seller: seller never sent item and was contacted several times with no responsewhy are these type of sellers allowed to continue selling on Amazon
0," Politics ruined cd for me: I thought the cd would be great, but their Bush bashing really irritates me. I would much rather not think about politics while listening to music. Music is an escape from the everyday hustle and bustle. Numerous times they wine about Bush. I will probably eventually smash this cd that was released for political reasons. Definitely not as good as the last CD. e"
1," Lloyd's ""Street Love"" Is Da Bomb!: I thoroughly enjoyed ""Street Love"" and consider it one of the best CD's I've purchased this year. ""Street Love"" has something for everyone and my fav cuts are ""You"" and ""Get It Shawty"". Lloyd sings with so much passion on this CD and his voice is very distinctive and unique amongst this new generation of R&B singers. Lloyd is eye candy as well with his flawless skin,long wavy hair and a chest that puts Usher's to shame."
1," So beautiful and relaxing!: I listen to this CD every day. It is so amazingly deep and powerful. You can connect to this music on so many levels, and it inspires feelings of peace and happiness. Truly good music! Who needs lyrics when you have Michael Travis, Jamie Janover, and Aaron Holstein?"
1," Great Pans!: These pans are a terrific addition to a baker's kitchen. Easy to use, easy clean-up. Non-stick for sure! I used them instead of a big bundt pan to make individual cakes. Perfect for the holidays! If your cake normally takes about an hour, plan to bake in these small pans for 15 or so mins. I was able to get ~36 individual cakes from one recipe."
0," Frued Multi-Rabbeting Bit Set: As did one of your other reviewers, I also was not able to fit the 5/16"" reducers into the 7/8"" pilot bearing needed to cut 1/4"" rabbets. I returned the set to the vendor who tried two other kits and experienced the same problem. I would only recommend purchase of this kit after confirming proper fit of all reducers."
0," DISAPPOINTING!!!: I have been a IJ fan for years and her books have always been keepers. UGLY DUCKLING was good... but since then it has been downhill. I was so angry by the time I finished THE FACE OF DECEPTION! IJ has forgotten the fans who have made her famous. The characters just made me mad-where was the romance?

0," Sportline Junk: Bought this Sportline 345 a year ago and it doesn't work right. Same distance walked one day was 4700 steps and next day 2400. Tested at home and it skips steps, sometimes 4 to 1. Junk. Buy Omron or Timex and save yourself a headache and $20."
1," Plain Truth: The Movie has taken some liberties, but over all the actors are great, & so is the story line. Good family movie to watch."
0," unwatchable: i bought this dvd and it took me several tries to even get through the whole thing. if you think that this will fill the void of the original ECW, forget it. as soon as i finished watching this dvd, i traded it in. save your money or buy something else. this is a waste. garbage wrestling, TERRIBLE commentary. ugh. XPW is trash, plain and simple."
1," revirw of service provided to me by amazon vendor: THIS IS A VERY WELL KNOWN BOOK THAT THROUGH A SERIES OF POEMS .... CONNECTS WITH THE EARLY IRISH SETTLERSIN AUSTRALIA.I BOUGHT THE BOOK VIA AN AMAZON VENDOR ... WHO CARRIED OUT EVERY ASPECT OF THE SALE .. JUST AS AMAZON WOULDLIKE. PERFECTLY WRAPPED,IN PERFECT CONDITION AND ARRIVED VIA THE POSTAL SERVICE ... BANG ON TIME.i would not hesitate to deal with this vendor again"
1," ""Everyday Life."": The song ""Walk"" expresses to me that every once in awhile, people get on your nerves, and you just want to tell them to step off! I feel strongly that this song says exactly that. The whole Vulgar Display Of Power album is hard, heavy, and relates to everyday life. It's not about religion, it's about the terrible things that people do in life, sometimes to other people, and to themselves. I give it a high rating of 4 because Pantera shows the emotions in their songs that others may think are too risky to elaborate on."
0," Do not buy it by CANDO: I have used a similar disc through my physical therapy, and purchased one to exercise at home. I did the mistake to base my selection on the lowest price, and I ended up with a disk that was saggy when it came, and it continues to elongate without coming all the way back while exercising. It seems that there is some chewing gum in the mix; I do no like the elasticity of the material, it does not compare with the one I used in OT, unfortunately I do not know the manufacturer of the one I liked.Bottom line: do not purchase the one by CANDO, opt for a different brand, even if pricier"
0," Poor readings: I thought the thermometer was calibrated incorrectly because it was reading 30F too low. It turns out that the metal body of the thermometer is losing heat from the toffee solution (few cm high). The readings were more accurate when I lay the thermometer flat in the toffee, but part of the reason I use a thermometer is so I don't have to do something crazy like stick my whole hand in a hotter than steam pot. I preferred my old glass thermometer. It was breakable (eventually broke) and a little slow, but the readings made sense."
0," disappointing comeback: i ran out to buy this cd after having heard the single ""amazing"" which i immediately fell in love with and expected to hear more great songs on george michael's comeback album. boy, was i disappointed! ""patience"" is an apt title for this cd because you're going to need alot of it to get through these songs. after ""amazing"" it's downhill all the way. i listened to the cd all the way through twice and was still unable to single out one other song that was in any was memorable or stood out among all the others. they all blended into a big boring mess! getting through this cd was an effort and i'll probably never listen to it again. of course, george michael's voice is still the same wonderful instrument it always was, but unfortunately it's not enough to carry this dreary assortment of songs.i want the old george michael back."
0," Too cheap!: The prongs on this comb are cheap machine made plastic that is actually too sharp and scratchy to the touch to put through hair. Always test a new comb on your hand, and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them. If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb, but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair. Sometimes you truly do get what you pay for so I suggest the wenn shower comb instead - it's excellent for thick or fine hair alike and it's extremely well made."
0," Save your money!: The scope is very difficult to look through due to the small diameter. There is no eye relief built in either. The scope's image is also marginally darker when looking through it.On top of that, I bought this expecting it to have the weaver or piticanny mounting system. It, however, does not. I believe it has the mounting system dovetail which is a lot smaller than what's common, and will not fit weaver rails.The entire scope is a lot smaller than I expected as well. It's only a measly 4 inches long.I can't comment on the accuracy, as I can't even mount it."
1, tunerThis: This is a good product to listen the satelite radio it works really good remember that you always need the interface for this product to work
0," WD-57831 - Buyer Beware: I have owned this TV for a little over one year and have already had to have the lamp replaced twice. The first time within two months of purchase, the second lamp lasted about 11 months. Once the warranty expires the cost for replacement lamps on the Mitsubishi website is $260. Initially buying a DLP set was cheaper than going with the LCD, but those savings will eventually be lost buying replacement parts. Also the picture quality is average, not much better than the ten year old Sony I replaced. Think carefully before buying any DLP set, especially one from Mitsubishi."
1," A Good Tricky Collectors Item: If your a true Tricky fan than this is something you will want. There are no extra tracks or anything on the cd but it does come in a nice collectors case. If you have the cd then you know how good it is so you won't mind buying it again. If you don't own it, then do it right and buy this one because it is sure to be one of your favorites."
0," I fell asleep half way through: Some people are humorous, some think they are. Some people teach you how to write humor, some think they do. This is the very last some.I had the download version. The audio does not provide with concrete suggestion as to how to write humor, but does emphasize there is a big market and big opportunity out there for humor writing. That, is an big encouragement, but tell me how."
1, Hells Yea!: I picked this book up at the Margaret Mitchell Museum in Atlanta. Being a southern woman I found the title and the subject matter interesting. Boy am I ever glad I read this little book! It was pretty intriguing to read 2-3 page summaries about historical and current southern women who've made an impact or just made there presence known. I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's a quick and enlightening read.
1," Closer to the mark than some: Writing about Alaska is harder than you'd think. The physical beauty can be both overwhelming and subtle to nth degree of white or gray. But the people whose traditions have bound them to the land and those who choose to live here are not always described well.I think Gerri Brightwell made a good start. She caught the strength of those who have been raised here and their ability to survive. She describes cabin life with feeling and is not exaggerating the constant danger of living in the deep cold. She touched upon the interdependence of Alaskan families; in this story there are negative impacts, while I witness far more positive and necessary mutual support.So, as a start, it begins to bring an image of Alaska to the foreground. Outside of Alaska as the setting, her prose is clean, the story line very believable, and offers satisfying growth in the characters. That alone makes the story worth reading."
1," Mother of a 4 year old: Overall, this is a great product to have because of its multiple uses on the track. The two tunnels on the side are made of fabric and can connect together, or on either side of the main center toy. My son loves to change it up a bit when we change the track around. The only down side to this toy is that we have noticed the trains getting stuck in the tunnels because the trains hit the fabric which stops the train from proceeding through. That is the only thing I found wrong with this product. Other than that, it is great to have because of the flexibility in changing it around."
1," dishwasher safe!: I bought these for my son. They're dishwasher safe, have not faded in about 6 washings so far, and there's no funky taste when drinking from them. Only down side is that they don't stack :("
1," Great bedtime storybook for a boy.: I read this book every night at bedtime to my young son for several years. The simple text rhymes and is great for getting a child used to a bedtime routine that includes reading. The story is about a boy who is playing, then gets his bath, has a bedtime snack, and goes to bed."
0," Case Logic: This fits all of my cds, but the zipper on it is very tuff. Otherwise a great buy. Price was good & everything."
0," Not for me!: I seem to be in the minority here, but I think this is gross. I'm thinking that having decided no more meat, maybe I'll skip the ""fake"" meat as well. This one for sure. Now what the heck am I going to do with a case minus one?!?"
1," Unique and interesting world: Isiah's long life is dedicated to ensuring balance is maintained. Sometimes, that makes for some nasty work, as is told in this story. I found it a little hard to get into at first but it was well worth the effort as it rocketed toward an end that wasn't at all clear. The moral ambiguity was interesting and the baddies were really, really bad. Fast paced, interesting and a satisfying read.It should be noted, however, that there is discussion and at times dismissal of organised religion and if that sort of thing pushes your buttons, this probably isn't the book for you."
0," Good Dictionary Bad Software: I bought this dictionary for use with a Palm T3. The dictionary is pretty good and reasonably comprehensive. However, it uses the MobiPocket 4.6 as the reader software. It never tells you that anywhere, I just happened to download this sofware earlier and recognized it. This reader is horrible for a dictionary. When you try to make the letter ""t"" or ""i"" using Grafitti it triggers the go back action. Also if you try to delete a letter it triggers the go back action. It also doesn't take advantage of the full screen. These shortcomings seem to all be addressed in the new 4.7 reader but it is not clear yet if I have to buy the new reader (which costs just about as much as this card) and if I do if I can even use the new reader with the card's databases. It was inexcusable to marry this dictionary to an inappropriate reader and furthermore to not disclose that anywhere."
0," It might be helping but it's not preventing or killing: It doesn't seem to be stopping new red slime growth or killing any that exists. I have used the Ultralife Reef Red Slime Remover with success though. - However, the Ultralife Reef Red Slime Remover claims to be enough for 300 gallons but it's only enough for 250 if you measure it according to their specifications.The underlying problem of red slime comes from too much food, silicates or other pollution. Keep this in mind when you are treating for Red slime. - eliminate it's food source, then treat."
1, facliting development attavchments: THis book is excelant and was a great help we will keep this as a reference book
0," Durge !: I met an old friend and he played me Josh Grobans''You Raise Me Up'. It sounded lovely and I wanted to get that lovely love song. I could not find the exact album on your Amazon site, so I chose something that might be near. Well, I am very sorry to say that this CD is highly depressing to me; not uplifting at all; so in fact a total waste of money.Also, what was confusing, it said that this CD was coming from the U.S.A. It had a price in dollars, 16 something. I do not know what I have been charged and the ultra confusing link the the U.S. was very strange to me, but I went along with it. If we get a huge bill my husband won't be happy! Please, Amazon, make your site easier. With many thanks, Helen of Troy."
0," RED RABBIT DOESN'T HOP: I quite enjoyed Clancy's previous books and I will no doubt purchase the next one, but I would not recommend Red Rabbit to anyone. First off, Clancy has Jack Ryan talking like a foul mouthed hippie and it is very much out of character for Ryan. Most disappointing, though, is that there is NO suspense. Everything the Americans and Brits plan comes through without a hitch and the Russians are depicted as, if not stupid, then certainly quite naive. Rabbit's wife hardly questions his defection! A very poor effort from Clancy. Seems almost as though this book was written to meet a publisher's deadline rather than to entertain readers."
1," Buyer beware! NOT FUNNY AT ALL: ""Divine"" - well that sounds nice. Rarely are things divine and end up to be disappointing.""Comedy"" - Oh great! I love comedy! I like to laugh like any guy.Well it turns out this book is neither of those descriptions. In fact the first portion is about the main character going through HELL! LITERALLY! It speaks of torment, suffering, despair, anger, and it is just an all around bummer of a situation Dante (the main character).This book is a book of extremes. It goes from extremely terrible, to extremely bland and desolate, to extremely bright. My eyes almost hurt from reading the last portion it seemed so bright.I won't ruin it for you, but be warned, there is no punchline."
0," useless products: I bought the golf iron headcovers to protect my new irons. The headcovers do not fulfil the description i.e they do not stay on the irons and therefore offer no protection. I have joined them together in pairs using the connectors provided and find they fall off in pairs and I have lost a pair already.If I had not removed them from the packaging and disposed of it I would immediately return them and demand a refund.As it is I find I have no recourse though I would like to do something about this.I DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANYWHERE I CAN REGISTER A FORMAL COMPLAINT, THESE ITEMS ARE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE"
0, Lame: They could have put more time into development for this game. Glad I got it cheap. Even free I don't think I can recommend it
0," WEAK: Amateurish production quality, ""Far Reaching"" assumptions about debris floating around the space shuttle cargo bay. Most of the video is a Physics 101 lesson by a droning young scientist. Lots of filler and fluff, very little interesting photos."
1, Excellent Headphones: These are one really nice set of headphones. They are very comfortable to wear. The sound as far a I am concerned is fantastic. When I am outside running my snowblower I can hear the music just fine. I have never owned a set of bose noise cancelling headphones but then again at $300 I could by 6 of the logitech.
0, Watch Out!: i sliced my finger yesterday trying to set this thing up. The rod has a gap in the middle with a really sharp piece of metal exposed. My hand slipped and I ended up with a 1/2 inch long cut and about 1/4 deep on my finger. Watch out. I taped up the exposed metal with some scotch tape.
1," Dance Music for the Masses: Hearing Becky in the clubs and on the radio, I went out and picked up the CD this week. This album is packed with energy and feel-good tunes. From the Kylie-esque ""Getaway"" to the power-packed ""If You Love Me"", Becky never skips a beat. Powerful pipes on this girl - watch out!"
1," A witty, thorough and informative book: The book reviews the evolution of English pistols between the English Civil War (1642-49) and the late 1930s, thus covering the birth, flowering and death of specifically English inventiveness in this field. The author constantly sets technical development in social context, filling the book as much with good tales, as with spanning-keys, scears and springs. US and UK readers alike will enjoy the revolver-controversy of the 1850s between the American Colt and the English Adams. Sadly, this mature and definitive book was written by a still young man who was, soon afterwards, killed by a sniper while serving as an officer in World War II. The companion book 'English Guns and Rifles' is equally good."
1," Great, quick meal: When I first tasted these I wasn't that impressed, but the more you eat the first one the better they get. They aren't overly chocolatey, but they do have a lot of chocolate flavor. They are very filling and I often eat about half of one and snack on the rest for the next hour or so. They are a great quick meal with a nice glass of water. I wouldn't even say they taste like a health food at all. Mine were fine as far as expiration date goes (it's March, they expire in May)."
0," Rip-off -- not Metra: Wires are not in the correct position for 70-7301. There is not a Blue/White wire required for remote amp power, hence, no sound in a 2003 Sonata."
0," Clear like an Encyclopedia: I have owned this book for one year and have been intimidated by the many favorable reviews this author has received. However, after looking up a topic in this book and, once again, having minimal clarity shed on the subject, I've decided to tell it like it is. It reads like an encyclopedia. I have 2 advanced degrees and learned chess, photography, and photoshop from books. But this book is user unfriendly and if I do not tell that to others, then they took will waste their money. If you do not believe me, then leaf through the book at one of the local book stores and decide for yourself. At least I've warned you. Stick with Scott Kelby, Rob Sheppard, Ellen Anon and Tim Grey."
0," What a disappointment !: Maybe it'll grow on me; but the anticipation of hearing these classic Paul Simon songs performed by Broadway singers was a severe disappointment. So often ""cross-overs"" don't work and this seems to be one of these cases - even great singers and interpreters of songs like Amanda McBroom don't seem to be able to add anything new. Maybe the songs just aren't as good as we had believed and these new productions simply reveal their shortcomings. I hope I'm wrong and that over time I'll grow to enjoy the album - I doubt it though."
1," Magical Fun: I loved this book. First I should put forth the disclaimer that I am an ametuer magician, so the concept of this book appeals to me personally. However, I also love a good novel and I think G.D. Gold has put together a fine piece.It has the kind of cloak and dagger thriller action that makes your pulse race as you turn the pages as well as characters that are well developed.My favorite aspect of the book was the wonderful exploration of its time period and how technology was affecting people's lives. That and just enough magic terminology to keep a magic insider satisfied that the writer knows what he's talking about without giving away the secrets.Well done, and a beautiful book to own with its lovely reproductions of classic magic posters."
1, WOOT!!!!: Ya the people who think that Ken and Barbie should get back together need to get a life. It is just a doll. Little kids play with it. Get a life losers. You are taking this way to personal. And ps Barbie and Kelly are sisters.
0," Yellow on Yellow (no black lettering at all): Terribly misleading picture. The Black writing on yellow plastic is exactly what I was looking for, and it is exactly the way most Swanson tools are made. NOT THIS ONE. This is all yellow without a hint of a shadow for contrast. You can still use it for square cuts and such, but don't count on reading the numbers. Get the metal version that is all grey - they are easier to read even with their lack of contrast.I plan to keep the one I ordered and spray paint it black and then quickly wipe the paint off of the flat surfaces in the hopes of getting something like what is pictured. Shame on Amazon for using this picture."
1, Best Gift Ever!: I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. We watched it as soon as he opened it on Christmas morning. (5 a.m.) We are looking forward to the second season on DVD!
0," Bad Service.: I've previously written a bad review about DVDStore because I ordered the film Anarchists Cookbook on April 3rd. Almost a month later I still had not received the film, yet i was [....] short in my bank account. I was really counting on receiving the movie for a research paper for school. I wrote a pretty bad review speaking of the unreliability of the DVDStore. Soon after my review an associate of the DVDstore and promised me reimbursement for the film and two free movies to make up for the mistake and all I had to do is take down my bad review. Well, I took down my review and this representative of DVDStore stopped e-mailing me and it's been a week and I have yet to be reimbursed and he is no longer replying to my e-mails. To avoid further complications like this I will probably not go through DVDStore and I will not take down my review until I am given back the money I've wasted."
1," Great for the money: I like the Gazelle Edge very much. It was easy to put together and very simple to fold-up for storage. I would agree with other reviewers about foot pain. I really can't do more than 1 mile at a time or else my toes start to go numb from the hard pedals. I've learned to take lots of breaks during my workout (I usually try for 5 miles a day). I use the tool more as a walking device and not a heavy, sweaty running workout. For $100 I still think it's a great deal. My only complaint is that is doesn't have a step counter on the electronic monitor."
0," La logique de la quantité contre la noblesse de qualité: La réalisation de l'ouvrage n'est pas très réussie. La couverture a l'air d'avoir été bricolée; ce constat est flagrant quand on la retire du livre. Le rendu de l'objet est trop lisse et trop vide à mon got. Il manque à la réalisation plastique de cet ouvrage la texture et le grain que l'on retrouve dans les images de Jeff Burton. La logique de la quantité qui prévaut sur la qualité semble avoir été ce qui a motivé la maison d'édition de cet ouvrage. Je retrouve malgré cela, l'esthétique des images du photographe mais reste insatisfait."
1, Great Buy!: My 13-year-old daughter wanted a pair of roller skates for Christmas. I found the same skates for much more money on other websites. My daughter loves them and wears them to skate around the house every day! I would recommend this product!
1, Strong and Sturdy: when i got this product i was a little iffy about it as it is very light and the handles are thin but i must say it has worked better than the super heavy expensive one we had for the farm that broke overall 5 for 5 stars
1, on of the most astounding books you'll ever read: an inspiring book from an amazing master. anyone who reads this is truly blessed. it will transform your life.
1, What television can be...: This is one of the best Sci-Fi TV series ever and my list of them is very short. The acting is very good and the episodes are well written. With a little work each one could stand on its own as a movie. The characters are well played and consistant with themselves and each other. The end of the series with the tenth season was probably a good choice.
0," Very very disappointed with quality: We are on our second machine. The first lasted 30 days. Then it stopped. We spent a long period of time on the phone with customer no-service. Eventually, they agreed to ship a replacement. The replacement died on its 3rd use - same problem.The concept is fantastic and, when it worked, it was fabulous; well worth the money. But I expect a product to last longer than that!!"
0, Wasted Time: I have followed this series since the early times when something was happening. I am still wondering what happened in this volume. The protagonist was again ignored and what looked like some truly great movement from the last volume came to a complete halt. I will continue reading this series unless I die of old age. Consider that the next volume will not be out until 2 to 3 years from now and you will see that the author had better get serious about the movement of the plot or he won't ever finish it.
0," Disappointing: Virtuoso bass player (capable of great things with Chick Corea, Weather Report and Jan Garbarek to name a few) floats off on a fairly self indulgent set. Aided and abetted by Don Alias (great) and lots of keyboard overdubs it has its moments but ultimately is disappointing."
1," Absolute Magic!!: I've read everything by Anita Shrieve-some better than others, but this is her best novel by far. I truly loved it. You won't be able to put it down. Her writing is magical. It is so descriptive and observant, that there were moments I was completely lost in the book."
0," Don't be a fool - avoid The Wise Woman: I normally enjoy this author's novels, but this one was too weird for me. Alys should have taken this book with her in the end of this story."
0," Scary: It is amazing how people swallow things just because it is in print. Tony Jones does a great job a laying out the principles that drive the book, but overall the book will cause more issues than it answers. There is a reason a lot of this is no longer practiced."
0," PROOF THAT DISNEY DOES MAKE CHEESE: I WORK IN A PRESCHOOL. ONE FRIDAY WHEN ONE OF OUR STUDENTS BROUGHT THIS MOVIE IN FOR SHOW & TELL, WE WATCHED IT THAT AFTERNOON. NOW THE YOUNG GIRL IN THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD, BUT EVERYTHING WAS JUST FALLING APART AROUND HER. BASICALLY THE MOVIE SHOULD COME ACROSS AS LAME TO ANYONE THAT ISN'T PRESCHOOL AGE OR YOUNGER. EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE THROUGH THE EYES OF A SMALL CHILD, I COULDN'T GET PASSED THE ULTRA CHEESE. 2BAD I HAD NO CRACKERS."
1, Good information and useful: We did a marriage enrichment class at our church using this book as a guide. Everyone seemed to enjoy the subject matter and said it was full of useful information.
1," My favorite CD!: This CD has been one of my favorite CD for over 10 years. Horowitz is at his best, and perhaps I can add, most charming. His Mozart is glorious and colorful. I cannot recall anyone who consistantly plays with such a singing tone. His playing has so much sparkle! Schubert and Schubert-Liszt selections are simply delicious. I never get tired of listening to this CD. Great CD!"
0, Don't buy from Amazon: Amazon has hands down the worst shipping department ever. I order several unleashed figures and they squashed them into a large box. I mean the box could have easily fit all the items but for some crazy reason they decide to bend the cardbacks so they all fit in a certain direction. They also screwed me and several other customers by not filling orders that got placed three months in advance!!
1," another life saver: brought this for my disabled son his other one broke. was really nervous about refurbished item, i never brought refurbished and knew that if i gave it to him and it did not work he would be unable to understand and think i was mean. but i thank amazon and seller for making my son happy he really loves the silver color the other ones(about 30 or more in his 15 years) were all black. looked alittle used but the works great. he looked at me like a was the best person in the world for getting this for him. thank you amazon. also remote works great no batteries so please make sure you have them. son gave it 3 claps and a spin."
0," Saves The Day Keeps On Failing: Cant Slow Down is my favorite CD of all time. The lyrics are pure brilliance and capture the range of teenage emotions from love to heartbreak to boredom to plain disgust. On Cant Slow Down you can feel the emotion come through the speakers. Through Being Cool was OK but just didnt have the raw emotion of CSD. Then came Stay What You Are which was Saves The Days ""radio friendly"" CD which prettymuch put them into a mainstream audeince of stupid little ""emo kids"". It wasnt very good anyways. The new CD In Reveire is unlike any other Saves The Day. Its not ""emo""-its not ""screamo""-etc. From what Ive heard its more a cross between the ""alt pop"" that made Sub Pop big in the 80s/90s mixed with a bit of ""emo"" and some Cave In style ""space rock"". If you are not a longtime Saves The Day fan you may enjoy it but for a fan its just listening to a once brilliant band turn into something unrecognizeable"
0, soul men: I thought this movie was going to be so funny but nope it's just stupid if you ask me. It's a shame too cuz usually Bernie Mack is pretty funny.
1," Great book to understand spiritual aspects of our body: Our body is a temple of various functions and activities. Each organ and part has an individual role to play in our life, yet they are all integrated to one central life force. This book offers a great understanding of how different centers are the locus for development and awareness that allows us to create harmony and effeciency rather than chaos and disruption."
0," Not for PSP3: Remote control doesn't work for PSP2 or PSP3, so You'd got to unplug it and use it like universal headphones."

0, Ball doesn't move smoothly: I can't use a mouse where it's hard to move the cursor! I had to return the item because of this.
1, 9012 Live: I'm glad they came out with the extended version of this. The additions were great! Even the solos were extended.
1," we love ""squiddy"": My son has had this squid for almost 2 years now, it has been through the washing machine on gentle several times, and it still looks great. He loves Squiddy and sleeps with him every night. It's such a favorite around our house we had to buy one for our daughter too. We picked this one thinking at 20"" it would be smaller than her brothers and easy to tell them apart, but it's really 30"" FYI. Every squid lover (who knew there were so many?) should have one."
1," Laughed, wanted more: I listened to this interview on First Voice. I got the book and read it. He's funny and very thoughtful in his writing, which I like a lot. But I gave it four stars rather than five because I wish the chapters were longer. Of course, with short chapters it's an easy read, you can read it in sections. Very touching his thoughts about family, like why he flies the American flag (www.firstvoicebooks.com/marsconservative.html). He is warm without being fake and hard without being fake."
1," SUPERB.: This album lives up to the musicianship and creativity of Greg Shelley's previous releases. Superior musicianship. My granddaughters play the first selection over and over, all the while dancing. And it is one of their favorite CDs to listen to at bedtime. This is a great CD to listen to while driving -- engaging, yet pleasant, just plain enjoyable!"
0," Doesn't play in the USA: Bewhere! This DVD doesn't play on a USA DVD player. The write-up by MovieMars didn't tell you that. I assumed that since they were in the USA, they would be selling a DVD that played in the USA unless they said that it didn't. I was wrong. So if you are in the USA, don't bother buying it."
1," great book for novice/professional shooters.: i bought this book due to all the reviews on here and all I can say is it was money well spent. being ex-Army, I never had any experience with long distance shooting but recently bought a rifle and wanted to learn/improve my skills. I figured buy a good book and see how it goes but DAMN, I never thought a book would this informative and just a pleasure to read. I showed it to a buddy of mine who is an avid hunter and he was so impressed he wants to get his own copy. I've only read the first two chapters so far and have skimmed through some of the others and this book is packed with info/advice i never would have thought of. I can tell already I will refer back to this book often. great reading for novice or pro."
0," Boo...: Ordered this for my 9 year old step son. He was super excited to receive it, but when it got there, it did not work. No lights, nothing.I didn't want to chance buying a new battery and having it ""work"" for a few days and then go bad, so I immediately sent it back.Bummer, because he had an Ironman kid's watch at one point and loved it, and this one was a decent price."
0," a shpping list of what not to do: This is a shopping list of things that could and have gone wrong with Mr. Sutton's many jobs of management. I appreciate the listings, but really felt there is no flow to this book, no continuity to the title."
1," a couple problems: I like this product, and still haven't fully explored all it's functions. I have found the built in drum guide is really REALLY loud. Even when turned to the minimum volume I often find it too loud and overpowering. The 8 different drum beats are uninteresting. You can not program in the beats per minute, you have to pedal stomp it in, or button tap it in. That's a bit of a drag. The phrase recording works well and easily. I use this pedal all the time, especially to practice."
1," His music still sounds fresh---even thought it is old.: Chris is a very sensitive writer/artist who wants to please God, even down to his thought life. You can tell he has been hurt in the past and that is why he asks the Holy Spirit to help him to forgive. We all need to hear his music now and then."
1, Please reissue: This is such a wonderful album of emotions and soaring vocal interplays. My lp is about worn through. Someone please re-issue this and their other albums.
1," very good book on time period: I found this book to be highly informative. I did disagree with some of it's conclusions, but the book would be an excellant intro to Iran's constitutional movement for a casual reader and is an excellant resourse for a more serious reader."
1," Give Me a Break: A good portion of the reviews for this CD are way off! Does a band these days have to scream like maniacs every song to satifsy their un-appreciative ""metalcore"" fans? This is a sound, hard rockin', great effort from Still Remains. Geez, let these guys get creative if they want!"
0," Thumbs Down!: Bought to spray latex paint on new remodel job...walls, ceilings and trim. Had paint thinned accordingly. This thing leaked paint like a sieve from around the front nozzle all over the floor...good thing for good prep! This unit would spray for a little time, stop, sputter, spit globs of paint, then not work some more.After 30 minutes of use it just quit working....Thank god! Not wanting to sound like I am biased and manufacturer bashing, I'm not, the fact is, I shy away from B&D; products and find them inferior for my taste, this sprayer is no different, I did not select it.This is being returned tomorrow for a Wagner Power Painter."
0," SHE'LL KILL AGAIN: The movie tells of the legend of La Llorana, a woman who drowned her children to be with her lover. He rejected her for what she did, then she committed suicide and wanders the earth, or wherever there are Mexicans, drowning children. Dr. David Stern (David Patrick Green) is an investigator and first person narrator for this tale. As a child his family was killed in an accident and only he survived. He has psychic abilities and can solve crimes. His goal now is to prevent crimes. He is fascinated by women who murder their children. He is convinced this can only be caused by possession and is proof of a higher power. Olivia's (Tamra Marez) children were drowned in her tub. She confesses to the deed, but can't remember doing it. It isn't long before these 2 subplots come together.The plot was horribly written. Dialogue was tedious with many pauses. Acting was non-existing. Occasion subtitles. Kurt Sinclair in his underwear.Rare F-Bomb, no sex, no nudity"
0, only a the worst rotary tool: i think this one is junk..the way you change tools doesn't work well comes complete with its own trash bagit does have power but i cann't see this tool being useful plus you have to buy more adtachments unless your looking for a sander
0," Sweet Agony: As bad as the cover suggests, ""Sweet November"" is not really a movie but a long soap-opera episode featuring Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron and a bland Enya soundtrack (yup, Enya. Sounds good, huh?). Essentially a cliched, tiresome and utterly tedious romance, this corny chick flick manages to deliver two or three decent scenes (mostly due to the solid Thero performance) and a lot of uninteresting tearjerker moments that drag endlessly. As entertainment this effort just falls flat, and as food for though it`s equally inane and useless. Nothing new or exciting here, I`m afraid, but I can`t say I`m surprised.Insipid and forgettable."
1," Very Helpful Book: This book was very helpful in the design phase of my deck building project. I built my deck myself, and it gave great ideas and illustrations which aided me throughout the building phase. Well worth the read."
0," Disappointed...........: Excellent price and free s/h; but the package arrived in extremely poor condition~~ 4 weeks after placing the order. I requested a return without even opening it. As this is not typical of Amazon.com, as well as returns are so easy, I really don't have much to complain about. Maybe Amazon should reconsider selling this item."
1, This really helps: I am writing my first book.This program helped me stay organized and focused on the plot.
1," Coldplay does it again!: This album is great. It has the best of coldplay, and the first 5 songs on this album are the songs that will always keep them making good music and will make their popularity huge forever."
1," Doll's Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process: Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process, by Ronald C. Doll (1996), provides the practitioner with a clear understanding of the essential elements of curriculum. This book takes the readers through the evolution of curriculum design and includes theories involved in curriculum development. The book is extremely informative and organized in such a way as to facilitate easy reading. Doll teaches the reader that he or she must consider many elements before embarking on curriculum design. Doll's book enables the reader to understand the planning process in such a way that he or she can then implement the strategies. I would highly recommend Doll's book to future curriculum designers and current educators."
1," Fantastic Urban Fantasy Novel: One of my most favored memories and my introduction into the genre of Urban Fantasy. Mercedes Lackey and Ellen Guon weave a wonderful web of Elves in the modern day world. The character development is extremely well done, but the plot is left a littl thread-bare in places. Not to worry though, as it seems that this novel is more about exploring the characters than it is about exploring a setting in a story. The characters of Eric, Beth, and Kory are well worked, and their feelings on all sorts of subjects is explored in great detail. This is one of my favorite all-time books. Give it a whirl!"
0," THREE SIMPLE LETTERS WTF: WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS ALBUM! SHE CAN'T SING, HER SISTER CAN'T SING, AND NIETHER OF THEM HAVE ANY MUSICAL TALENT AT ALL. I WAS AHPPY WHEN SHE GOT CAUGHT ON SNL, BUT SHOCKED TO FIND THAT THE NATION OF TEENAGE GIRLS ARE SO BRAINWASHED THEY THINK SHES INNOCENT. AND IF I HEAR ONE MORE SONG FROM HER WHINING ABOUT HER SISTER GETTING ATTENTION I WILL BURN EVERY ALBUM OF HERS I CAN FIND. IN CONCLUSION I WILL NEVER GIVE THIS GIRL CREDIT, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SRGUE WITH THOSE SPOILED TEENAGE GIRLS WHO LOVE WHOEVER IS ON THE COVER OF SOME DUMB MAGAZINE."
0," Waste of money: Wow lets have women portrayed as neurotic, b****y, and crazy yet again in another movie. Yes we know hormones go full swing during pregnancy, but they didn't even bother really trying to make this funny."
0," fun at first, but tends to lose it's zing..: I am a big fan of open-world rpgs, and don't get me wrong Gothic 3 delivers that large world greatly, but it does have flaws that completely killed the gaming experience for me.The Good:Large open worldLoads of side quests to doKilling king Rhobar, King Zuben and Xardas was a blast with some nice lootExploring can pay off pretty wellThe Bad:The time it took out of my life to get the community patches to make the game playableThe game is so open that it is rather difficult to find what to doWhen you discover locations on your map it is not marked so you can easily forget how to get backEnemies are easy and predictable, unless you try to melee an ogre, it is so hard lolIf you go about and kill all three main leaders in the game you cannot beat it without cheatsThose are the things in this game that killed it for me, but hey its 7 bucks worth a shot eh?"
0," It does not work!: This product supposes to kill mice, but it does not. I bough 1.75 pounds of this ""poison"" in the middle of June and started feeding mice in my garden shed. I started with one bar of Hawk Bait, but very soon had to increase the portion. Two and a half months later the bucket 1.75 Lb (!) is almost empty and I see more feces in the shed, they love that product! I keep only garden tools, a tractor and some lumber in the shed, nothing else. There is nothing to eat except Hawk Bait chunks. I'm not going to buy another 1.75 Lb of Hawk Bait."
0," The Heart of Anger: This book was recommended by an acquaintance who neglected to mention that, in order for the book to make sense, the reader would have to be a biblical expert. The text is sprinkled with references to chapter and verse. The reviews on Amazon gave no indication that this book is really only relavent to someone who believes the bible--old and new testament--are absolute and literal truth. As someone who does not hold that belief, the book is totally a waste of paper for me.I only wish I could return it."
0," Very Disappointed: I love DDR and was excited to finally get a new dance pad that works. I was surprised when it showed up that it was not the same kind of dance pad that had originally come with the game. It's made of thick, cheap foam and slips easily, unlike the flat pad with good grips that I had expected. I've had the pad for less than a week and the arrows are already broken.I use DDR as a form of exercise (and I am quite good at the game), and this pad cannot withstand much use. I recommend looking somewhere else for a dance pad."
0," Suspense writer attempts evangelism: Slow, heavy on the religion. Probably very appealing to the devoute but does not offer much for agnostics, atheists or those looking for an interesting read. Unlike earlier novels, provides little information (even on the religious level)and a trite plot. Though Rachel's character, such as it was, held some appeal the ""hero's"" and his redemption were reminiscent of dirty cotton candy - sacharine, sticky and insubstantial."
0," Wish I had read the worst review first!: Love old Esther Williams movies, and this one is a classic...BUT the quality of the DVD reproduction was awful. It was obviously cheaply produced--perhaps even filmed directly from a movie screen with old ""film streaks and bubbles"", blurry and not the usual DVD features or quality. This was the only DVD listing foor this movie title; if there were another alternative seller for this movie, I'd choose it. If you just want this title anyway, just be forewarned that the quality is very poor."
0," Nice book, too bad Amazon's stock is all damaged...: While the book is great, I have received no less than 3 damaged versions of this book from Amazon. Clearly their entire stock is messed up as each replacement they have sent has the same problems. Namely, sticking pages where glue leaked from the spine during binding, scuffed and soiled covers, and heavy dings or crushed spines. Order from someone else!"
1," A good subsititute for corporate radio: Given the low price and the ""indirect"" technology (using a radio frequency to transmit), I was skeptical. But the overwhelming opinion here was positive and largely right. I live in Washington, DC and despite a full spectrum of radio stations, I have found a frequency that works for DC and most of the Maryland suburbs. If you have an audiophile sound system, you'll be disappointed (but probably won't be buying this anyway), although it's no worse than an ordinary car radio. I drive a Honda Accord, that most generic of cars and it works fine, although you have to to be careful of where the adapter for the cigarette lighter is inserted (it's less intuitive than it should be. This is probably no substitute for a true in dash adapter, but it certainly beats listening to corporate radio with its short play lists and inane chatter. And the price makes it a bargain."
0," Wow: Plug seized to block and snapped off in '01 Honda Civic 1.7 vtec, Anti seize didn't help. Now have to remove head to get the plug out.. Super Fail, never buying NGK Again. Never had this problem with Denso."
0," Not a good introduction: This book seemed to be written more as a reference manual than a user's guide. It has lots of detail (probably more than I really want) on many different kinds of trusts, but it never attempts to put everything together to give you any idea how to start coming up with a comprehensive plan. I realize that I need an adviser to come up with an actual plan, but I was hoping that reading this book would give me some ideas of where to start. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It describes each tree in the forest in (sometimes excruciating) detail, but I still need a map of the forest. Ideally, I would like some examples of paths that people in different situations might take through the forest."
0," Photo is misleading.: I bought this at $14.99, thought it's a deal. But the size is so so small, the largest one is something like 7""x5"". Photo is misleading. At least this is not a deal."
1, Best cart cover ever: I love this Buggybagg shopping cart cover. It is the best cart cover ever. My baby loves it and so does my husband. He is very picky about everthing that has to do with our first baby. It is so easy to use that I can set it up with one hand and hold the baby. It is so comfortable for my little one. I read all the reviews before I decided to purchase this one and I am so glad that I did. It has a zipper that you can zip it up and carry it anywhere.
1," Greatest Christmas Album ever!!!: I'm actually not a Jewel fan. I don't really enjoy her style of music. I like Christmas music and I was worried I would regret purchasing this album. I did not want to hear her yodeling ""O Holy Night"".My worries were put to rest. Her version of ""O Holy Night"" surpassed Celine Dion's, which I thought was the best prior to hearing Jewel. She sung the Christian classics in a traditional manner, with a touch of her own style, with a voice surpassed by none. After hearing this album I'm convinced she is the greatest female vocalist of all-time. I still prefer Celine as an artist but that is a manner of taste.This album is the greatest Christmas album in my book. I highly recommend it even if your not a Jewel fan, like me.Just to make it clear, I'm not down on her other stuff. It's just a manner of individual music preference."
0," Zero Stars...........: I will sum it up for all the readers..........Many things wrong with this LP like: Wack lyrics, Wack Flow, Wack Harmonies, Wack Voice, Wack Looks, Wack Production, Wack Guest rappers, One good song in 4 Da Fam.It shouldve been Illegal to let this even get cleared for release. Shouldve never left the studio floor.However this is not the worst album ive heard but it is doggone close.DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! You will waste money and will be disappointed.Dont Say I didnt warn ya."
0," A Stranger Is Not Watching: This movie caught my attention with it's name, ""A Stranger Is Watching"", more or less because I enjoy a good horror movie. This movie had none of that. What you get is mostly a very uninteresting movie about a killer with a good chase scene coming too late to redeem this uninspired B-movie.The only true suspense was wondering when it would ever get off the ground and really get interesting. Long story short, it never happened, the best part of the movie was the title."
1," Elektra: This movie was good. Jennifer Garner is one of the reasons why this movie is good. She does a great job of presenting a cold, darker version of Elektra . Her performance to me was not flawed in any manner. In fact the cast overall was decent. The story was very oringinal, and did keep my attention. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel's super hero's."
1, Bosch 03416 Distributor Cap - 1998 Honda Accord 3.0 V6: This distributor cap fits perfect. Looks exactly like my old one. No complaints with this product. I would recommend this to a friend.
0," Used to make a great chicken waterer.: I bought this to use for my six chickens as an alternative to an $80 heated poultry fountain. So far it is working perfectly. My dog's water dish has been frozen every morning this past week or so (she's an indoor/outdoor dog though so she gets water inside also) but the chicken's water has not frozen at all. I am very happy with this product so far. I will come back and write more about my experience with it as the winter season progresses.*update 1/16/12 - The temps have been in the low 20's to upper teens overnight for the past week or so (not counting wind chill) and the water in the heated bowl has been frozen every morning for at least a week now. I don't know why it is freezing since it was designed to keep the water thawed, but regardless, it is not doing its job and as is, it is completely useless to me. Guess I'm going to have to buy that $80 heated poultry fountain after all. *sigh*"
0," This movie is quite bad: This movie is basically a cheap rip off of the whole X-Men mutants story. Billy Balwin, and two cohorts are mutants sent back in time to help thwart disaster in the future. Of course, since Baldwin is involved, you know the acting is horrible. The dialogue is wretched at times, and the special effects (especially the fire effects) are totally cheesey. Save your money and buy both X-Men movies instead."
0, Push by Sapphire: This book in my opinion was not well written. I feel like she left a lot unsaid at the end. I think she could have done a lot more with it. The concept of the book was great but not a well written book. I would not recommend anyone buy and read this book. I hope the movie is far better than the book.
0, Frank Miller should sue!: In the 80's comic book legend Frank Miller created one of the toughest female characters of all time(before it was trendy) with Elektra a fearless merciless ninja assasin who takes on a demonic organization bent on taking over the government.In 2004 along came Hollywood.In this movie Elektra falls in love with a nice single dad and teams up with his 14 year old girl to kick butt.The gritty comic book is so watered down I kept expecting them to have a slumber party and maybe even a pillow fight before taking on those pesky ninjas!Star Jenifer Garner so great in Alias is bland here.The special effects and fight scenes are unimpressive and the story dull.Fortunately Miller made sure Hollywood didn't dillute his Sin City it's too bad he had no part in this film.
0," Poor sound quality!: I purchased CX300 and Sony MDR-EX75 at the same time from Amazon at a great price.Some may not agree since everyone's taste in sound is different but...After trying both earbuds, I would strongly recommend to spend extra few dollor and purchase Sony earbud. Sound quality is MUCH better.My $5.00 no brand name earbud sound is about same as CX300.Sound is very weak."
1, Delicious but hotter than i remember: great product and authentic. May be fresher than your used to so use scantly when just opened. As advertised and tasty.
0," Gunslinger by Connie Mason: One star is way too generous for this. Desperado (come on, Desperado?) is a chauvinist pig with no class, intellect, or respect for anyone and Chole is a complete twit who does little more than droll over said pig for the length of the book. Combine that with a complete lack of plot, and this is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. Save your money for anything by Lorraine Heath, Kathleen Kane, Maggie Osborne, or Susan Kay Law. This one isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
1," Makes Lewinsky Battle Seem Tame: Now Andrew Johnson may not have been hiding with an intern in the oval office, but this book has a lot more to offer. Drama in the House, drama in the Senate, verbal fights, threats, it sure beats the heck out of blue dresses and cigars. I don't think people have any idea how close Johnson was to being kicked out of office, let alone for what reason. Benedict does a remarkable job chronicling the times surrounding the day. Going in I found the battle to purely partisan, but after reading I agree with Benedict, the impeachment was justified."
0," New formula tastes terrible! :(: These have long been my favorite snack cracker, but I'll be searching for another one now; Kashi recently ""improved"" them with alleged ""tastier crunch,"" and the resulting taste (burnt/bitter) and texture (tough/seedy) is nothing I would care to experience ever again. Really wish I hadn't purchased a case. Blurg!"
1," Nintendo, King of Gaming, Does it again!: This game is the best reason to own a GBA!<br />What Nintendo has done is ""retold"" the old NES Metroid story by adding more story, better graphics, great sound (Remixed music from the NES Metroid), and more powerups. You will see all the old bosses from NES Metroid, plus a few more. You even get the old NES Metroid on there as well to show how far we have come in 20 years.<br />A must own for any gamer!"
0," Faulty: Purchased multiple dog toys from Kyjen Plush Puppies for my dogs birthday. This pig was the only one that arrived and did not work. I pulled out to little strip of paper in the back of the pig that said to remove and the pig did not make any sounds. My dog was very disappointed. I even opened up the Velcro in the back and pulled out the voice box and tried to squeezed it myself with no success. Great price, but only if the item worked."
0," Disappointed: Bought this torchiere because I could not find one locally. Paid more than I wanted to (Just found one for $16 at Menards home supply). Worked fine for 90 days then went dead. When I contacted the Vendor, I was told that I could exchange it for the first 30 days, but if it was defective (It wouldn't work), I had only one week from the purchase to report the defect. The Vendor would not offer any remedy for my useless lamp. (I am used to this kind of lamp operating for several years.) I would think twice before buying from this Vendor again."
0," Too small for squirrels: This trap is way too small for the squirrels around me, it is more like a chipmunk or rat sized trap. I highly recommend you sketch out the measurements before buying so you can see how small it is. 5 inches by 7 inches is a very small width/height. After I got mine I went to Harbor Freight and got a larger trap for about the same price, and so far I have caught two squirrels in two days in the larger trap while this Havahart model sits nearby untouched.If you are transporting your squirrels I recommend you put the whole trap in a disposable plastic bag as they will likely pee when in the car."
1, Erotica Through the Ages.: This book is a fine representation of erotica through the ages with examples from portfolios of great photographers. This is a great anthology of primitive to the modern world of glamour/erotic photography.
1," Works Great!: I have a 20' x 20' garage. This does a good job of heating it up quickly. I crack a window, just in case, but haven't noticed any fumes (seems to burn efficiently)."
1, great ideas: I love the way this was written. I could just picture a no nonsense pioneer housewife. Not everything would pertain to the modern day but still very good.
1," A superb work - but read the shorter one if you're not a PhD candidate!: This is a superb commentary - as just about anything by Thiselton is. However, when leading a Bible Study on Corinthians, I found Thiselton's 300 page (as opposed to 1500 page) commentary on 1 Corinthians, published by Eerdmans, a far more helpful and manageable affair. It's subtitle is, 'A Shorter Exegetical & Pastoral Commentary.' In this shorter work (written and condensed a few years after this one), Thiselton gives his opinion on things, makes numerous contemporary insights, and raises provocative questions that would be helpful for each pericope. These questions are invaluable, both for the individual reader - but also as 'reflection questions' for groups. So my answer? BUY THE OTHER COMMENTARY ... and get this one if you love the infinitesimal discussion!"
1," The best advanced undergraduate quantum text book: In my oponion this book is one of the best books about quantum mechancis. It has very good explanations and clear expression. I have studied several books about quantum mechanics such as Gasiorowics, Liboff and Ohanian but this book is the best one."
1, ...: This book is amazing. I feel like it helped me open up and see things and people for who they really are. It changed me.Thank You James.Megan
0," Not worth the money: I'm completely perplexed by the rave reviews for this game. I found it frustrating and confusing as to just what he heck this game was about, much less how to make everthing work. The manual is vague at best and trying to make anything work was impossible. Don't waste your time with this."
0," Buy this with Barney the Dinosaur and save!: As a big fan of Brian Greene -- having read both The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, I thought the DVD would help cement and retain ideas in the book.In fact, there is little if any content. There are, however, lots of pointless, flashy effects that convey no understanding. Lots of cool sound effects, too. Professor Greene jumps through walls and disappears with lots of swooshing noises.Toddlers will be mystified and enchanted by this. It really beats the mobile spinning over the crib."
0," Once this was pure evil!: When I was young, Motorhead was the hardest thing around. Then came Venom! I bought ""Black metal"" on LP and in fact I liked a couple of tracks. Now (long after I sold all my LP's) I saw this album released on CD, and I decided buy it again, for old time sake...I must say that the metal genre surely has developed, or at least gone further we could imagine back in 1982. By today's standard Venom are no longer the heaviest or meanest guys... With hindsight we can clearly see that Venom weren't even that talented in the first place but the title track ""Black metal"" sure have something special.I guess you can buy this album for nostalgic reasons but if you're unfamiliar with Venom I guess you'll find it all rather ridiculous. The production isn't good, but for me who haven't heard this album in almost 15 years it was quite a pleasant experience. Maybe another 15 years will pass before I put this one again."
1," Best Multi-Purpose Bag Ever: I love this bag. Its the perfect size to hold basic purse contents and also doubles as a small shopping bag when I'm out picking up little things. The straps never fall off my shoulder and I've never lost my cell phone in the bag as there are several small pockets in and around the bag for me to store it. The super cute pattern is an added bonus, I get so many compliments on how cute the bag is."
0," Broken before I got them: Wow, I thought these glasses would be strong, being made from test tube glass. Not so. I ordered three boxes of 2 in a box. Two glasses were broken in separate boxes. I am returning all. They are too light and break way too easy. Disappointed because Bodum is a favorite brand for me."
1," Accurate: Bought this to monitor humidity in my sons room. About 4 months after it arrived I decided to calibrate it. The humidity reading was dead on, and needed no adjustment. I was impressed. The temperature was accurate also. $20 for an adjustable hygrometer is a great deal. My only complaint is the small size."
0," Dissappointed...: This book is a basic guide to understand what lubrication is, and an introduction to the terms employed on this subject. There's no useful level of detail for a person that has been more than three months involved in this area in practice.I disagree with the Editorial Review that describes it as a detailed set of explanations about many items involved in the lubrication process in industry. A basic description is not what I've always understood as a detailed explanation. This review is what made me buy the book; now I know this is not the book for anyone who wants a medium degree of clear information."
1," Quiet, beautifully conceived, well written: I've seen Michael Clayton several times now, and the movie has gotten better with each viewing. The interweaving of these characters' lives - while they remain unknown to one another - is impressive. It's not a new movie concept, it's just done so brilliantly here, it need not announce itself. Clooney and Damon, Tom Wilkinson and the rest are strong. Our conclusions, sad. The movie is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate a smart script, well-acted, absurd and tragic, watch it two or three times."
0," Horrible fan mount: This mount was said to be super easy to do, this took me about 4 hours to assemble. The rubber parts don't fit the metal mount and there is no way to get the rubber pieces in. I had no doubt that this product would work but I thought wrong. Horrible set up and design !do not buy!"
0, Does the cat of fatness and large color of orange explode on: Why no this statemnent that I puprosed before hand not one on my arm would now will appear to not be of truth. For why does the disc contian movie that is below goodness level of medium? Let us go ask people created such horrible movie. Please person there on there computer right now reading this content of review? Money is of no use on purchasing video disc with contain such movie as CAT: the Garfiled.
1, Yes its mindnumbing but its funny too.....: I completely understand those who think after awhile this movie just knaws at your brain in the painful way redundacy always does. But i can't help giving this movie a good review....its too damned funny. Benicio and Depp are perfect and (along with the book) this movie has to have the most quotable funny lines in any movie I can think of.
0," Decent but fragile camera, terrible warranty service: I purchased the X50 and have been happy with it for the most part save its video mode which is sub par. However, I dropped the camera and even though there was no visible damage to the body the LCD screen was damaged internally with an odd shaped section of about half the pixels blank.I sent the camera in to Minolta warranty repair and it seems that to repair it they had to order a new LCD screen component from Japan. I've now been waiting 5 weeks (not including shipping time) for my camera. I find it totally unacceptable that the repair turn around is so slow. This is a current model with probably hundreds of thousands being shipped so why can't they have spare parts on hand in the US. Bottom line likely is that warranty repair is not profitable and therefor low priority."
1," Very practical: I liked this wire for my bonsai because it is easy to get around the branches and sturdy enough to keep them in place. I am training a wisteria and the branches can be very stubborn because I got it late in its life, and this wire has proved invaluable."
0," Snap Crackle Pop!: The set I bought was comfortable, produced a nice sound, and passively blocked noise well. (Here it comes.) BUUUTTTT these headphones popped and crackled constantly with the two heavy bass test tracks I tried on them. If you're not going to use them with that kind of audio (super heavy bass) then they'll work fine for you. With that kind of restriction though, they just aren't worth the price."
0," DON'T BUY (duplicate..not original): I looked around in class, and every body had small compact, smooth, and colored books.(same material). Am the only one who had this bulky, black&white, big boring book. This is not the original book, its just printed sheets which make it too big & heavy to handle. It looks so funny, i don't know why 2 people gave a 5-star. I should have 1st read the one-star reviews before i bought it. But I was too late........"
0," real eye opener: This book is a real eye opener for. How a book so poorly written, lack of substance and specific could be on the best seller list?! I bought the book after reading some pages on chapter one that seem to be a good introduction to more good advices to come. The problem is that the whole book IS the introduction! Mr. Kiyosaki is the true master of the art of talking-for-hours-without-telling-you-anything. I should have listened to those 1-star reviewers.For those of you who found this book useful please seek professional advice before spending more money on more books, seminor or games from this guy. It's a SCAM."
0," Horrible!: This is without a doubt, the WORST ""horror"" film I have ever seen, and I've seen them all. It is slow, plodding, and outright laughable. The fact that Susan George is beautiful dosent't make up for the fact that this story was so predictable, the ""frights"" so laughable and the acting so pitiful. Yes, it may have started the ""trapped babysitter"" genre, but it is horrible. If you truly want to see a great ""trapped babysitter"" film, rent Halloween."
1," A great live collection for the Dan fan!: I recently heard this CD mixed in with other non Steely Dan tunes at, of all places, a chinese restaurant. I thought - Wow, is this new? I didn't realize that I already had the CD in my collection. When I got home, I gave the Alive in America CD another listen, and began to really appreciate the album. If you like Steely Dan, you should really own this CD."
1," Great Album: My 2-yr-old and I listen to this album and another of hers a LOT and it is great. Elizabeth Mitchell has a lovely, lovely voice and her choice of songs is such a great blend of folk songs, kid's songs, and cool covers drawn from lots of musical styles from reggae to rockabilly. Songs that might under the usual circumstances drive you insane, like Skip to My Lou or Froggy Went a-Courtin', she slows down and makes seem fresh and pretty. It's terrific music that kids and parents can enjoy simultaneously."
0, need more detail: I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific. They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident. I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.
1, THE RETURN OF SCRAPPY DOO: fIRST I'M NOT FEELING THIS ON THE REGULAR BUT THEN I STILL CONSIDER IT A GOOD IF YOU FEEL BOW WOW THAT IS IF I WAS 12 AGAIN I WOULD BE A HUGE FAN.BUT HEY IF YOU LIKE BOW WOW IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY.

0, DVD order: Sent the wrong DVD. I will have to either buy a new copy or return the existing one and re-request the correct copy again.
1," Courageous Woman: Intriguing, informative and insightful of the ways of China in the late 1900's.Well written and easy to read and held your attention. Shows a very courageouswoman."
1, GG's magnalite purchase: I purchased this product as a house warmimg present but I own a magnalite dutch oven and a 2 quart boiler that is 44 years old from a set that I owned. I would highly advise anyone to purchase this cookware set.
1," Inexpensive, Works well.: I bought this to hook my Att U-Verse TV box to an A/V switch and my home theater system. It didn't need to be rugged as it will seldom be disturbed. It was inexpensive and does the job - just what I wanted."
1," Outstanding, a must see.: This movie was outstanding. I laugthed, I cried, I was amazed.Don't wait bye this film while you still can I bet you'll love it as much as I do."
0," Dreadful!: Save your money - the writing is awful, the characters are empty and the story sucks eggs. I actually wanted to take the book back and ask for a refund. Who would publish such a thing??"
1," Hey, Jazz Enthusiasts!: From a Japanese release to an European one, this compilation is definitely for the jazz fan. After ten years, the US debut gives the jazz fan a chance to treasure Royce in collaboration with famed Japanese jazz producer, Yoichi Nakao. Royce Campbell's guitar shines in the forefront of this genre and the selections benefit."
0," Another wannabe: Another self-promoting individual exploting the kindness of the old-timers. Although the information is interesting, it lacks real scholarship and passion."
0, bad fit: This item was a bad fit for me and I suspect others. First the battery terminal opening is none standard and to large. I had to place a shim in it to get it to clamp well. Also the battery cable mount stem is oriented the wrong way to easily mount it cable based on how it was mounted. third the cable mount end moves around when you losen the knob which will allow it to make contact still if moved and reconnect the battery. All in all not a great design.
1," It Just Hits It Where You Live: Anyone with an eye for beauty cannot help but admire the light and color of this enduring and endearing Disney Masterpiece. But great art must take into account content; it must hit you on a visceral level. And there's no finer example of this anywhere in filmdom than the final chase sequence. From the moment the old bloodhound resolves itself to set things right, to his ultimate sacrifice, there is no more touching pathos ever set between sprockets. I cannot even think of it without becoming overwhelmed by emotion. I can actually steel myself against DUMBO's Baby Mine, but no matter how I coach myself (""It's just paint on plastic, for Pete's sake!"") I am swayed by Disney's band of geniuses. And I am actually proud that I am so swayed.Such boldness and honor are rarely evinced so well on a screen or presenium. All dramatists could do well to study it. It is truly high art. Ahwoooooooo!"
1," Fascinating Premise: I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title ..And since taking the zinc and cutting out my preNatal vitamin, I am sleeping again!!! Also, this months' PMS was not so bad. I hope it gets better and better but so far I am a believer in this Copper theory. Her stuff works, that's the bottom line for me."
1," V - Dvd of mini-series: Upon receiving the DVD of V the tv mini-series, I was delighted and even more so after watching it.Thank you so much for the prompt service and the excellent quality of the DVD."
0," Missing errata and download files: I started to use this book and came across a few errors. These resulted in errors in the output. I went to the website to find the errata for the book but there is no errata as promised.Also, the book states that the scripts can be downloaded from the website. I could not find them.I think anyone wishing to buy the book check out for errata, if they can find them, on the website. I didn't and I probably would not have bought the book if I had known there was no support from the publisher.I have always had a bad experience with Mc Graw Hill."
1," Novice in Snowshoes: I am brand new with using snow shoes. I found this pair easy to put on and strap in. I still haven't figured out what to do with the extra amount of strap that hangs out. The strap that I tucked in stayed in on one side but not the other. I'm still learning.However, the walking was great, and while it will be a long time before I'm running in them like I saw a woman do in my area, I at least know that I can get around in them.I would purchase them for other members of my family.Janice-Golden, Colorado"
0," Ken Follett..some hack has assumed your identity.: A reviewer on Oct. 21 gave this 5 stars and read it in 5 hours. I believe it was written in 5 hours while under duress. Follett should be ashamed of himself...plot doesn't hold water, characters are undeveloped and uninteresting...lazy, lazy!!!!"
1," Strong construction, good design, heavy duty finish: It is a truck hitch which is a fairly basic device but Curt has made a useful improvement with the 5"" adjustment range for this ball mount. The paint on it is very thick and likely to hold up well, not that a rusty ball mount is likely to weaken it, but it is nice nonetheless.It is rated for 5,000 lbs. and if you stay under that it should hold up very well.Before buying the Curt version I saw ones for sale for less money but after reading the reviews it was an easy decision to pay a little bit more and get this one."
1," shut up and jam: IT IS A GOOD GAME TO GET HAPPY TO PLAY, AND BUILD FROM THA EXPERIENCE.THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT ALL SO.."
0," incompatibility with software: Sadly, this printer would not work with specialized legal software that is dos based. After several hours working with the support tech at the software company and NEC support it was determined by both that this computer could not print from this software. We have been using an NEC SuperScript 660i very successfully and attempted to upgrade to the 1400 and retire the 660i. For other programs it is probably wonderful."
0," Not as good as the original: This game was one of my all-time favorite games for the old Nintendo Entertainment system, so I was very happy to hear that NST was remaking the game for the Game Boy color. However, this version of the game spoils pretty much everything that was good about the original. The game holds your hand every step of the way. This new ""feature"" might be great for your average 5 year old, but it greatly tones down the difficulty and removes all sense of freedom and exploration. Also, the great music from the original has been removed and replaced with garbage. If you want to play a good version of Crystalis, play the NES version. If you want a good adventure game for your Game Boy, buy Zelda. As it is, this version of the game is a disappointment, so I can't recommend it."
1," A good read: Bodyguard was a good read. The characters were fully realized, the writing was excellent. I'm sorry to say that the book never really gained my full attention. I found myself skipping pages. The hero was your typical tortured hero and I liked his character. The secondary characters almost stole the show and held my interest more than the main characters. As for the heroine, I've read better.<G> Her focus on her looks was rather annoying. I thought her shallow and silly. A good read but I've read better from Brockmann and haven't given up on her. HEARTHROB is still tops with me. Brockmann, when she's good, the woman is good. I've enjoyed her Navy SEAL titles like Prince Joe, Harvard's Education, It Came Upon A Midnight Clear and The Admiral's Bride. Brockmann is a very talented writer and I am definately looking forward to her longer, more involved Navy SEAL, full length novel."
0," My copy might have BEEN a copy...: I enjoyed seeing this when I first got it, but upon reviewing it again this past year, the DVDs won't play. They seem to be bad copies or just DVD-R copies that tend to lose their storage retrieval. I would caution anyone buying this, especially if it's USED that it might not be a professional DVD. I'm not sure. I know I'm not happy because it doesn't play now."
1," Not a fan: My favorite of the traditional Earl Grey teas is Bigelow. Personally, I find Twinings too light and a bit sour. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."
1," Fog free: Finally! a saftey device that doesn't fog up. I had stopped using anything for eye protection.Any glasses, goggles, shields... I used would fog up. I completely recommend the Triton. Comfortable, ear & eye protection and the price isn't too bad."
0, Ill advised project: This cd is the Titanic of Carlise's career and listening to it makes you want to walk the plank rather than wait for inevitable death by drowning. I will say that the French pronunciation is surprisingly good but trying to make a Celion Dion record just don't cut the mustard.
0," No Nostalgia Here!: This is not the top from your childhood... it is small, has a thin metal upper dome, and a thin plastic lower dome. The pumping mechanism slips sometimes, so the handle sinks back into the top without gaining momentum... and the plastic tip on the bottom is too wide or slick or something... This is not a quality item - it is cheaply made and is barely functional. It doesn't have the heft of an old top, doesn't balance properly, and doesn't work right. On the bottom of the toy, on a little paper label, it says ""Made in China"".I really want an old fashioned top for my kids to play with! One that doesn't have a suction cup (this one doesn't - that is why I bought it!). But this is a cheaply made replica. I am going to look at FAO Schwarz or ebay to find one that matches my memory."
0, Excellent Handbook fo Advanced DIYers: This book has been an excellent handbook in working on a major remodeling project of our 15 year old house. Text is easily understood and the phtography of the worksite and the tools are crisp and easy to view. Both compliment one another. Am very pleased to have spent the money on this reference! I recommend it to all DIYers.
1," Rayman 2: This is the most auesome game on N64. The graphics are great and the game is great. It isn't too hard, but it is not easy either. It has one fault the camera angles are horrible"
0," Not one Heyer's better efforts: Although Ms. Heyer is one of my favorite authors, and IMO her works transcend the romance genre, I found reading Bath Tangle an unpleasant experience. Hero and heroine are both self-absorbed, savage-tempered, sneering ... they richly deserve a lifetime of bickering with each other. This book has a mawkish, overwrought flavor -- quite missing are the humor and charm of Ms. Heyer's better works."
0, Ugh: Mostly gives a history lesson on pirates. Not my interest. I once lived in Pensacola and thought the book may have some local theme.
1," Sad and heartwarming at the same time.: Well written, very sad story about our Foster Care System and how it failed this child and others. Heartwarming to see how children respond to love and how determination can change a life."
0, Wasted My Money: I struck this fire starter about 10 times and it was already gone. I looked at it and it looked like one that i bought a year ago and used a countless amount of times. I left it alone for some time. I struck again and about 3 sparks came out. I was extremely disappointed with this product.
0," This Novel Makes Reading WORK Rather Than Pleasure: If you like John LeCarre, you'll love this. The British seem to turn out these spy novels with too many characters to keep track of, all muddled up in incomprehensible comings, goings, and way too much gawd-awful talk. I read for pleasure and it is just too much work to try and understand what the hell is going on, who said what and why, etc. These Brit spy novels also have the unhappy habit of no-emphasis on conversations and events, thus a murder equates with buttering a piece of bread as far as the text is concerned. Not for me, thank you."
1," Perfect!: The best few bucks I've spent in a long time! Exactly what I was looking for. Now my daughter has about a fifth of her bedroom floor back, and I'm no longer stressed out over the mess! Wish I would have thought to buy one years ago."
1," Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter: Works fine for what I need this for, although could use more instruction or tips for use."
1," New York tourguide.: I've read so many new york books and this is my favorite. Can't use most of it on the tours but jaw dropping stuff that makes you realize, times change, people don't. Just because they were better dressed, doesn't mean they were better behaved. For example the old top preacher who had affairs. So much more hilarious and serious at turns."
0," This one fell flat.: ""Code to Zero"" is set during the Cold War, and the US/Soviet space race in particular. It is the story of a group of friends at Harvard who become scientists and spies, spouses and friends. We begin with Luke, who wakes up in a men's room with no memory of who he is. Bit by bit, Luke figures things out and events come to a head at the launch of an American satellite.The story is by no means awful... but based on Follett's earlier, compelling, powerful storytelling, it is a disappointment. The characters are somewhat flat, the dialog is stilted, and the plot is simplistic.Follett certainly set himself a high bar with his earlier novels, which I do recommend highly. I was sorry that Code To Zero didn't meet that same standard. If this were my first Follett novel, I'd probably not pick up another... don't make that mistake, the others are very worthwhile!"
1," Wonderful family movie: I saw this movie several times as a child on television. I would love to have my children now watch it with me. The movie shows, in my opinion, the importance of obeying your parents and yet following your heart. I still want a mongoose as a pet. I HATE SNAKES!"
1," Perfect: Just returned from a 7 day cruise to the Caribbean. Used this wallet to keep my money, ID, credit card and ship card nice and dry. Didn't have any issues, and was used daily."
1," Poor logic, but very good passion: Henry James' first ghost story, first published 1868, then included in two story collections during the following 20 years.In pre-revolution times, two New England sisters are divided by their common objective. Only one can get the English friend of their brother. The winner can not enjoy her victory for long, she dies of a disease. As she anticipated the following action by her sister, she manages to arrange a long term revenge mechanism. Don't ask me how the mechanism works, sisterly hatred can do miracles."
1," An interesting way to waste your time: Out of all the games out in 2003, I think I enjoyed this one the best. The graphics were pleasing, there was plenty of content, and a great community feeling. While the xp grind was there (get used to killing wolves...lots of wolves) it was masked by quests, community, and a good crafting set up. On top of that was the slightly unusual role play for dragon toons, who aged and developed over time until they gained the power of flight."
1, Excellent reference material: Do not let the comment by inisglas@seanet.com impeach your view of this material. While I can't personally speak to this situation any one with any knowledge of this field will tell you that more people plagarize from John Matthews with out any reference to his work than any other author I've ever encountered. I also know from personal conversations with John (including discussing the number of reference volumes in his library) that his scholarhip is thorough and personally done. I would recommend this book highly for the person who wants to do their own exploration of the subject and isn't looking for a cook book approach to shamanism.
1, Great!: Box set contains great recordings of all of Jerry Lee Lewis greatest hits as well as many less well known tunes. Has a bonus recording of Jerry Lee and Sam Phillips cussing and discussing religion. Great music and great fun!
1," Another Diamond Undiscovered: The fact that Jubilee by Dotsero was initially released in 1992 and still after 15 years is hardly even known amongst smooth-jazz lovers is a sad testiment to the politics of the recording industry.Dotsero is every bit as talented as the Rippingtons, Spyro Gyra, Solar Wind etc. Yet for some strange reason they don't get the air play they so definitely deserve. I could go on and on about their musical abilities, wonderful songs etc, but better yet allow me to assure you if you like the bands I mentioned above, you'll love Jubilee by Dotsero. Perhaps the highest praise I can give Dotsero is to tell you out of the over 600 CDs I own if I had to keep only 25, Jubliee would be in that group."
0, Inaccurate: Cites the discredited Barsky who claims diseases like ME/CFIDS are psychogenic. This attitude contributes to a tremendous amount of iatrogenic morbidity.
0," BIG Disappointment!: We bought these last year for our 5 year old. When she and her older sister played with them, they had to stand within 10 feet of eachother to be make out what the other was saying. The static was also terrible. A week later my daughter accidently dropped one of them and it quit working completely. BIG waste of money!"
1, Great book for older sibling having trouble with a new baby: I loved this book. My own mother read it to me when I was very small and had a new baby in the house to deal with. I was pleased to find it just as poignant the second time around with my own son. The words used and feelings expressed are something I have not been able to find in any other book.
1," I really love this pump: I bought this pump nearly six years ago while pregnant with my son (4th child) and have used it since then through 3 babies. Before that I had tried MANY pumps, none of which I was satisfied with. For me, comfort is the name of the game. This pump fits the bill. As with any pump, the secret is in the let down. One will not get any significant amount of milk from any pump unless you are able to let down. To facilitate this, I highly recommend breast massage before pumping no matter what pump you use. The squeaking can be annoying and does not lend itself to discreet pumping, but that is the only problem I have with this pump. As far as having to lean forward, I have never used a pump where this was NOT necessary. This is by far the best pump I have ever used."
0," Great Headphones But.....: I am absoultely addicted to music. one would be hardpressed to find me without headphones in my ear ever; even during classes.i bought these headphones twice. when i got them, the sound quality was absolutely amazing and the fit was nice. but before one month was up, the wire for the right headphone became loose. the second time i bought them, the same thing happened but it took slightly longer to become loose.these are great headphones for the price but if you except to overuse your ipod or whatever you have, try to get more sturdy headphones."
0," Disappointed: Total thumbs-down on this product. Sound quality was terrible, which surprised me, because other reviewers had had nice things to say about it. The straw that broke the camel's back was the adapter that was supposed to fit the iPod Nano. It simply did not work. The only way we could connect the Nano was without any adapter, and that didn't look or feel right, too fragile. I spent a little more on the Altec Lansing iM600, which sounds fantastic, although that product's clock/alarm clock, supposedly integrated to the iPod's, is bad engineering. for one, you set the alarm and you have to leave the unit on and there's a hum you have to listemn to all night. We're keeping the iM600 for the sound, but using a little clock radio for the alarm clock. Too bad we couldn't find a unit that did everything for the $100 we spent."
0, good until my lighter started smoking: The product worked fine until the lighter part of the product came apart and started smoking and melted in my cigarette lighter. Not sure what happened
1," Excellent - far exceeds expectations: We received this book as a gift and it really makes the A+ grade. My ds 8 and dd 9 love it - and with the additional information it provides (e.g. state rock, state animal, prominent landmarks)it could be used at much older ages. With attractive pictures and interesting text, this is a enjoyable supplement for homeschoolers - a way to make Geography lessons fun. This is a book to read and reread. We do hope to acquire more of this series!"
1, kitchen products review: I relly like this pan.I like the heaviness of it.This is an excellent pie-baking panand I definitely feel that my money was well spent.
1," The best cookbook I own!: This is the by far the best cookbook I own, and I own at least 100 of them. I would give this more than five stars if that were possible. Every recipe I have made has been incredible and is fine to make for my husband and myself or fancy enough for guests. I love this cookbook and can't recommend it enough!"
0," Somewhat Worthless: I find this video to be pretty much useless. The arpeggio section is pretty much a waste of time, since he plays the same arpeggio but in different positions over and over. He doesn't offer much in terms of licks, mainly just how to move up and down scales\arpeggios using his approach. You do get to see him play live, which is a treat because he is so fluid. The last lick pretty much sums up the whole video, I would not even bother with the rest. So I would recommend staying away from this and maybe just finding some licks on the net."
1," The best one yet?: I think that this could very well be the best Redwall novel yet. At the beginning I didn't think much of it. But when Martin reached the Arfship it got really good. I loved hearing about Luke and how he defeated his enemy for his tribe and son. It is also very interesting to read about when the abbey was first built. All of my favorite characters are in this book too, Gonff, Bella, and Martin. I love Gonff. Brian Jacques must be really creative to think up all of those poems that Gonff always chants. Well, all in all, it is a wonderful book. The first and third parts of the novel aren't worth much unless you are really into Redwall. But the third part is extremely good and will keep you seated motionless for hours until it's over. I can't wait until Lord Brocktree comes out!"
1," Zune gift: Great product, price and service. Product was delivered in time it was promised. Product was a gift and was delivered without disclosing contents. Thank you"
0," Misleading: I bought this book because I thought it would help me visualize (in some way) the 4th dimension. But, although the author does indeed try to do so in the first three chapters, he then starts going on about quantum mecanics (briefly), special relativity and general relativity in the ""traditional"" way: with Minkowsky diagrams (1 space dimension and 1 time dimension), so I guess the 4th dimension simply is forgotten after the three first chapters.If you are looking for books on quantum mechanics, special relativity and/or general relativity, there are much better books than this. If you are looking (as I was) for a book on geometry and the 4th dimension, than the first three chapters of this book are not bad, but are not enough..."
1," Handsome, lightweight cup: Ordered these cups b/c the ones I was using were staining and were made in China. I wanted colorful cups that would resist coffee stains, And these fit the bill. They are lighter in weight, than I expected, but not a problem.....made in Germany."
1," I love micro-budget movies: I really like this movie. Most people would think this movie sucks because of the very low budget and all that implies, but I think it was done quite well for what it is. Very interesting ambiance, and I liked the music chosen for the movie."
0, Stay with the plane!!: Man vs. dogs. Why leave a crash sight that will be looked for. Stay with the plane and eat like kings picking off one wolf at a time.
0," With it on, you can hear more than wearing ear warmers :-): The noise-cancelling function doesn't reduce any noise at all. With the switch on, you still can hear everything. The noise insulation capability is even not as good as ear warmers. Don't know if the one I have is a defect or others are the same. Anyway, will return it tomorrow."
0," Slows down rather rapidly, do not buy: I bought this watch thinking about it as an authentic timepiece, but it slows down several seconds in the matter of a few hours. What if this happened in warfare (like in Vietnam, which is mentioned in this watch's name!)?? I returned it immediately. Do not buy. A Seiko 5 which is only a little bit expensive is much better than this"
1," Adam, Eve, and the Ape: In Adam, Eve, and the Ape, Faith with lusty cheerfulness attacks the doubters and deniers. In this book, Louis de Wohl, the gifted novelist, offers more than fifty brief essays in which Faith rides herd over the terriain of modern fallacy.Here is a digest of things that matter, and matter much because they concern God and man, heaven and earth, and the hope that spans the way between. These essays reveal de Wohl, hitherto best known as a prolific novelist, to be a vigorous champion of things human and divine.With sound knowledge and wise wit, de Wohl makes no pious apologies for bein a man of faith in the modern world. Some will cheer, and some will sneer, but no one will be bored.--- from book's dustjacket"
0," Review for this listing only - this is Brazillian knockoff: I have only recently begun to collect Nightwish. I started with the American Nuclear Blast 2CD+DVD issue of End of an Era but for the most part have been collecting European Spinefarm issues - I have the Spinefarm 1997-2001 collection which I purchased from Amazon, I have the 8 track Spinefarm issue of Bless the Child and I have the Spinefarm 2CD+DVD of Highest Hopes. What I received from Amazon for this listing was not the Spinefarm issue but a Brazillian knockoff from NEMS Enterprises. It may be legitimate or it may not, but it isn't what is listed here and it makes me angry."
1," Perfect for my Mac Mini: I use this to run digital out to a stand alone DAC, then to a Vincent integrated amp and a set of PSB bookshelf speaker. Sweet music to my ears!"
1," Mixed Feelings: That this story is well written cannot be denied. What the author chooses to write about, however, is disturbing to any loyal DC comics fan. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back and enjoy any Ralph/Sue Dibny story the way I would have if I did not read IDENTITY CRISIS. What was the author's motivation for a work that left many fans feeling violated as they helplessly watched one of the most benign/likeable characters in the DC universe being subjected to one violent atrocity after another?"
0," Whiney Jewish New Yorkers: I found this book to be racist. Maybe Jewish people might enjoy it. And it is terribly disrespectful of women. In terms of entertainment, I simply was not entertained."
0, Gardening in the coastal south: The info on line was misleading. I ws searching for information for Mexico as I have a home there. This title came up. It is not what I was expecting. The info on line led me to believe it would include Mexico.
1," Not just for geeks!: For nerds, these two led interesting lives. Steve Jobs may make for a more believable rebel but once you see this documentary you'll see he had his own wild side. Very accurate and keeps a good pace."
0," AVOID -- HDCP required (its own definition): This DVD player will not work with monitors it thinks are non-HDCP monitors. I connected the DVI cable to my 2006 Sceptre LCD monitor that is supposed to be HDCP compliant. The DVD plays a few seconds of the DVD in the background, and even gets to the menu screen, then says 'non-HDCP compliant device' and goes to white snow/fuzz. [HDCP is the movie version of DRM - only stupider. ONLY pirated DVDs will play with this type of 'protection'.]"
0," Neat little book: This sturdy book contains six precut stencils in a medieval theme. The pages are durable and easy to remove, and there are lots of uses for them. I used them to make more pieces for my feltboard, and sometimes I'll color them onto my windows with dry-erase markers (Instant stained glass!) The designs included are a fantastic gargoyle, a crossbowman, a great dragon, a castle, a knight on horseback, and a jester with juggling balls."
1," More than expected...: This album is perfect. One catch, if you don't like Mazzy Star, you probably won't like this album. I happen to love all 3 Mazzy Star albums and was just starting to long for more when I discovered this solo project. It is just simply perfect. If you did buy this and like it but don't have any Mazzy Star, you should definitely go directly out and buy some. The slide guitar definitely adds something awesome to Hope's molasses voice, however as she has now proved, she still sounds great without it."
1," Great Seller: Great Product. I loved Dr. Quinn when I was younger and am so glad to watch it again. One minor glitch in the last Disc, but I am glad that the Movies Disc came with it as a bonus."
0," Cheap plastic junk: Like every other cheap plastic hose caddy I've owned in the past, this one leaked. Plastic hose fitting threads are doomed to leak sooner or later. I'm done wasting my money on them. Time to look for a more expensive, better-working brand."
0," Worse experience I have had on Amazon: This was the worse experience I have had on Amazon. This product was nothing the seller said. I would never do business with them again, and Amazon should try to find more about sellers like the person who sold me this product and kick them off the Internet."
1," Mother's Day suprise: I bought this DVD set for my mother because she loves elephants. My mom had seen the first Echo documentary and fell in love with Echo's story. When I presented the DVD set to my mom on Mother's Day, she was thrilled to find so many elephant documentaries in one set. I am so glad I got the set. I recieved it really quickly too."
1," Great flick save one small thing....: Seriously... Obama's face on currency? I hardly ever speak out in a movie theater.. but that sight caused me to blurt out ""Bullsh*t"" quite loudly."
0," Waste of money: If you have a Compaq forget it. The card does not like to share IRQ addresses. The ""boy"" that works the support line has no clue. Only answer is ""this happens with Compaqs""."
0," Djeez, get yourselves 2gether!: One good song (La nuit) on a terrible album. This has nothing to do with proper electronic sounds; to be compared with Miss Kittin is a downright insult to Miss Kittin herself.This album is a good example of uninspired musicians trying to ride along with the electro hype currently invading Europe.If you're looking for wellproduced albums, try Fischerspooner, The Hacker, Anthony Rother, DJ Hell, or the real deal in electropop: Vive La Fte."

1," No problems encountered: I have not had difficulty with two problems that other reviewers have encountered. The first reported problem is that the microphone boom lays against one's cheek and muffles the sound. This does not occur for me - and in fact I have tried to do this and it physically won't happen for me (I'm a 6'5"" male). The second reported problem is with very limited range. My headset works to about 15 ft. with my Treo 700w. I have no problems at all when my phone is in my pocket or in a belt holster.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sound quality reported by the other party is a little ""muffled."" Otherwise, battery life is very good, noise cancelling ok and I've had no problems linking with the Treo."
0," Not for me: We gave this CD away, not to our liking. Prefer less ""background and choir"" more emphasis on voice, delivery and solo performance."
0," Absolute tripe: This book is written on a fourth grade level, and might be interesting to children of that age. There is nothing new or even mildly interesting in it. A complete waste of money!"
0," Doesn't work & crashes your computer too: when i installed the software, it gives u a warning that it has it hasn't been approved by MSoft as being compatible to Windows XP. However, the instructions tell you to go ahead anyway, which I did. The result: my computer crashed and I cannot even uninstall the USB 2.0 VIDBOX software, which just wasted 1.0 MB space in my computer hard drive. This software does not work!!! Since I got it from Costco, at least I could return it and get my money back. Had I bought it from a different store, my $50+ would have been wasted. Do not buy this product. You might crash your computer too!!! I wanted to give this a zero star but the lowest choice is 1."
0," Not a good book: Someone chose this for our book club and not ONE person liked it. I tried to read the whole thing, some of the settings were appealing, however parts of it got so bizarre and it was just strange. Sorry to the author or anyone that likes it, but out of 12 women, not one person finished it or liked it."
1," Enjoyable: Great fun. I haven't enjoyed a comedy this much in a very long time. While the pace of the movie did die off at times, it was more than made up for in other parts of the movie."
1," Made an excellent Christmas Present: Actually, I've never watched the movie - but my oldest son had it on his wish list for Christmas. The ONLY place I found it (Director's Cut, Digital Copy) was on Amazon."
0," Not very happy: I find the stilt's structure comparable with what is sold at a higher price, but the accessory parts like the spring tensioner, nuts & bolts, and straps are inferior. The weld on the wingnuts snapped off the first time I tightened them; you don't end up saving any money by the time you pay for all these extra replacment parts and any expedited shipping. Better to go pay more locally!"
1," Soundtrack to my life!: I pre-ordered the everglow months before its release, anticipating anything remotely close to Destination:Beautiful, even their B-sides album. When i finally listened to it, it moved me in such a way that i can't describe. I've been involved with music for 7-8 years of my life and no album compares to Mae's ""The Everglow."" Each song carries a different personality and message, which rich chords and catchy melodies. I reccomend this album to anyone who appreciates music to the fullest and can respect the work these guys have put into this album"
1," Inesquecivel!: ""Os Meus Passos"" e ""Quadras Soltas"" sao definitivamente as faixas preferidas, mas nao me canso de escutar esta grande senhora do Fado. Uma voz inconfundivel e interpretacao magnifica que nos fazem ficar em silencio e segui-la pelas cordas das guitarras. O mais puro ""Fado"" do coracao de Lisboa, este CD nao pode faltar na discoteca de quem aprecia este genero de musica."
1, Good product: Sound is great. No one can tell that I'm talking on a headset. Works great with FIOS internet phone. I wish that I did not have to lift the handset off the receiver to answer the calls. I'd rather wear the headset and just punch a button to answer. A very minor issue though. Good product.
0," Worth 0 if you ask me.: This guide literally gives FREE information. The complete guide can be found at www.squaresoft.com (changed from playonline now). Word for word, squaresoft.com has copied the book into html format. It is a COMPLETE ripoff. What you are buying is not useful information found in well written strategy guide. Instead, you're buying something that you could've gotten for free.As for the guide itself, it proves useful and is well written. But no matter how good the guide is, the fact you can own it for free completely destroys the purpose of purchase."
1," The Dysfunctional of all dysfunctional Families.: A gripping, terrific read. The Wiseguy/Goodfella is portrayed as a narcisstic, hedonistic rat. Karen comes across as completely different than portrayed by Lorraine Bracco. Karen is close to a Saint. And Henry is close to the Devil. The children produce a sensitive, thoughtful account of ""Life on the Run"". They both displayed maturity FAR beyond their years."
1, The Perfect Shell Dweller Shell: I bought these shells based on an earlier review saying these are great shells for shell dwelling cichlids. And they're everything anyone could look for in a shell for this purpose...they're very pretty shells and lightweight so the tiny fish can move them where they want them. They were packaged carefully so none were broken or cracked. I was really surprised at the quality for such a great price. They're definitely 5 stars.
1, The best ever !: I think that this one of the best albums made.2Pac is just the bomb .He is one of the greatist rappers ever to live .It's just a shame he had to die at such a young age.I think he is one of the most loved people in the world.And he so fine.
1, question: love this movie and I own its vhs. But I can only give it 4 stars instead of 5. The reason is there are two problems that I don't get. why does the arthor Mr. Wharton make this ending? Why is Newland at last not willing to meet Ellen again? Can anyone please answer me? Thanks for reading!
0," Little Action, Too Much Proselytizing: This is a religious book, not a detective story. It tracks the life of a patrol cop whose life is empty. His new partner is a born again Christian who recognizes he is suicidal and attempts a religious intervention. The description of Tony's experiences working the midnight shift in midtown Manhattan seem authentic, but there is little plot other than Tony finding the meaning of life. For those readers seeking a whodunnit or mystery novel, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1," Miller's Testament: Miller's review of life in the 50's on Big Sur is engrossing in so far that it is separated from our contemporary lifestyle (for most Americans) where all needs are met quickly and without much hassle. He doesn't speak highly of being a recluse in the woods, cut-off from society like going into the wild, instead he favors moments of companionship; in visits from guests, sending and receiving mail. His appreciation for the quiet and grandeur of the country is full of compassion that resonates beyond our modern notions of conservationism, it is about the nearness to God and finding heaven on earth (and hell). This is Miller's testament to living simply and loving it."
0, Disappointed: I can not believe this seller. First they give you a timeline of about a month and they never even send it. Do not buy from them. I just filed a claim to get a reimbursement through Amazon. I emailed dellparts and got no response what so ever. Ridiculous.
0," The horror, the horror ...: I'm sure that there was a lot of hard work put into this album, and it breaks my heart to tell that it was for nothing ... Well actually not for nothing, this CD will sale nicely but if you appriciate good and creative R&B; stay away from this CD like Michael Jackson from the sun.All the songs sound the same ... even the beat is the same ... and it's allright cause ""Grindin'"" is quite nice but why should I listen to another 14 ""Gridin's"" ?I see pepole reccommend ""In search of"" by the NERD ... now thats a good CD! maybe you should spend your money on that CD instead of this one and if you must take two so take the amazing ""Clones"" album by the Neptunes.Good Day."
0, This game stinks: This game stinks because it has no point and is really dumb.No one should buy this because as soon as you get to the ice level with the Biesin it's impossible to beat. This game is also dumb because when you shot the person with a rocket they don't die. By any game but this one.
0," Boring and stiff: This is a rather boring and stiff DVD - my 3.5 year old daughter watched it for 5 minutes before asking for a change. This may scare some people off from ballet rather than encouraging them! The disclaimers at the front of the DVD, although perhaps necessary - add to the sense of seriousness of this DVD. Not recommended."
0," Changed from Original Print: I bought this book for my children as it was my favorite one as a child. Too bad the publisher has changed some words for political correctness. Buy the vintage version, not a new copy. Most disappointing."
1," fun pass-time: This volume contains a number of fairy-tales that adults will ""recognize"" as they are similar to popular favorites (i.e. Cinderella, etc.), but it also had some good ones that I had never heard."
0," a freshman effort that cries for narrative technique: The other reviews must have been written by the author's friends. While I liked the idea of the book and what he was trying to achieve, I finally gave up mid way through. This book seems to be a real freshman effort. It's ferociously extended with dialogue and virtually no narrative. Most of the dialogue is pedestrian. It should have been a gem and brought in under 200 pgs. I don't know what purpose the father and Marianne serve. I don't think they edit books at Alyson. It was a delight to read about characters searching for love with all their quirks, but learn some technique."
0, Make sure you measure!: This drape was a foot too short for my window. The colors or patterns didn't really coordinate with the planes and trains set.
0, junk!: The cage fell apart within days. We were able to force it together to get about 2 weeks out of it before we had to throw it out and go buy a new cage.
0," Helpful but mistake-filled: This book is really helpful to break words up into their latin roots, but the teacher's edition has a lot of mistakes."
1, Hilarious modern pirate read.: Unknown author but the way the main characters kept going from one bad situation to another was hilarious. Worth the time to read this book.
1," Not Spectacular But Though-Provoking: A college professor is accused of seducing one of his students, and is resigns his position in disgrace. With his life somewhat out of control, he moves in with his daughter on her farm in a rural - and tumultuous - part of South Africa. There they are brutally attacked and each must come to terms with what has happened to them. This book is strangely disturbing and thought-provoking. The characters are not given much depth. In fact, it is difficult to say whether they are truly known or not. The ends without an ending as well. However, it is a story that stays with a reader. It is also an interesting study into life as a white person in South Africa and how the balance and blatant racism - on both sides - is prevelant. Not a book for those interested in pure entertainment, but for deeper reading, I would recommend."
1," An epic true tale: We die alone is about a botched allied operation to plant Norwegian commandos trained by the SOE to go into German occupied Norway and to send radio messages and do sabotage missions. On the way German forces find out what they are planning to do and a German ship destroys their small fishing vessel and kills everyone but Jan Baalsrud. Jan swims a shore in below freezing conditions and shoots and kills a few german soldiers. The adventure continues when Jan is must contact villagers, must ski many miles under German Control, must avoid German controls, must cut of his own toes, lives in a foxhole fore almost a month in freezing conditions and must avoid falling of mountains due to snow blindness. THis is an amazing true story. the authors tells the story and makes you feel like you are truly there. This is a great read"
1," St. Joseph's Catholic edition of the NAB: This is a very good edition for all of us. The translation is easy to read, and the volume contains the Apocrypha, useful maps of the middle east, and photographs of Christian and pagan shrines.The one minor negative is that I bought this same version thirty years ago and it was a red letter edition. No matter."
0," YUCK!: This fondant tastes horrible! It has this really bitter after taste but before that after taste, it tastes like nothing... YUCK! I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1," Shower curtain: I am really happy with this shower curtain. It is beautifully clear, it feels like a quality product, and it opens up my bathroom. I have a friend that bought one because he saw mine. Trust my word. You will not be disappointed."
0," Where's the beef??: I agree with another reader that states that how can he NOT cover OLE DB, especially with VB6. talk about VB 5 rehashed. Save your money and read the documentation that comes with VB 6."
1," Politics and Horror. Finaly, the two are combined.: You might not think so, but the combination of both the Political and Horror themes works very well as far as this book is concerned. I've read a few of Guy N.Smith's books over the years and this one, I reckon, stands out as one of his best. Given all the different horror topics out there today that have been done to death(Zombies and Vampires to name a couple)I thought Fiend offered a unique and refreshing change as far as plots and characters go. So if you're after something a bit different check this one out. It's worth it."
0," One AC/DC at a time!!: Boy, this Swiss band is bad. Copying AC/DC all the way from the singer to the drummer, it made them a lot of damage!! The songs had potential, had them not been just a cheap copy. And it seems they returned..."
0, Farberware 4 cup egg poacher: The knob on top of the lid gets extremely HOT. Usually the knob stays relatively cool. Also the egg took longer to cook than the stated 4 minutes - more like 6 1/2 minutes. The egg would look cooked on the top and sides but the bottom was raw. I would not recommend this poacher.
0, could have been better: ok this item is garbage wat the picture dosent show u is the way you load it it is a small VERRY small lever ont the side in which you have to pull back as you are setting the bbs in you almost need three hands to do it and not to mention it goes throu co2 really quik the model is flawed and the company could have mad a magizene for it
0," WHAT? this does NOT represent their greatest hits.: this cd does not represent blink182's greatest stuff at ALL. if you want that, get ""the mark tom & travis show"". i have it, and it has a lot of their best stuff."
1," when you think that you know everything... than you discover that it isn't: I've been strumming guitar for many years. I've read many books about guitar theory and I thought I had a good knowledge of the theory that one should know to master the guitar, but when I first discovered this author Desi Serna I had to admit that I was on the edge of the beginning. I started to study this book and then I bought all his publications. They are always on my desk and every time I reread a chapter I say to myself that I have found a gold-mine.[...]"
1," Insightful poignant lyrics (as usual): It takes a little getting use to because it's quite different than their previous two CDs. Of course, I felt the same way when ""Lifesong"" came out. If you are a Casting Crowns fan it will quickly grow on you! Mark Hall always delivers insightful lyrics for us to think about. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed."
1, technical but entertaining: Comprehensive details done with humor where possible making for a easy time of reading 400+ pages. The standard textbook for MBA classes related to Marketing.
0," Spend your money elsewhere: Seconding another reviewer, expect this caddy to rust. It's worth about $8 to $10 at best considering you are going to throw it out after a year. It gets a couple of stars from me because of its design, being fairly functional. But if it's going to rust out, why bother? I ended up throwing out actually two of them and finally biting the bullet by investing in a nonmetal shampoo, conditioner, hook, and shelf arrangment that affixes to the tile. Sure, it was much more expensive, but I've had the latter one for three years, there are no problems at all, and I'm never going to have to replace it."
0," ahh...the word ""plastic"" might be helpful: I'm an idiot for not reading the product description more carefully, but usually the word ""chrome"" implies I'm buying something made of metal. This p.o.s. on the other hand is made entirely of chrome colored plastic. The only thing metal in the box is the cup (which coincidentally is the least important part of the whole unit). The tip of the mixer rod is also made of plastic. It will not crush ice. If you want a serious mixer, either go to your local restaurant supply (the smart move) or buy a Waring."
0, Complete Gym workout!!: It took 80-100 pushes to inflate a queen size bed. This pump is extremely labor intensive. Why deal with the pain when a rechargeable battery operated pump cost only $15 bucks more.
1," Glory of bygone days: I was a USAF weather observer stationed in England when the ""United Sates"" made it's maiden voyage across the Atlantic. We, of course, received weather reports from all the ships at sea and plotted thier name and weather report at lattitude and longitude onto our maps,to be able to track storm systems long before they reached Europe. One could follow the dwadling progross of the various ships as they made their way to their destinations.However, the ""United States"" progress was a completely different and amazing thing. We couldn't believe that a ship could cross the Atlantic so fast! A source of American Pride, indeed!Reading this book of the trials and tribulations of the architect is fascinating story - a bit slow a times, but is well worth the time and money to read about just how the greatest American ship came about."
1," Settlers is fun, the additions make it great: My family has enjoyed Catan for year. Buying the bundle has been great whne we have company and the bundled additions allow us to introduce new elements to the game every time we play. Highly recommended."
1," interesting characters: West offers a direct line to absolute realism in this well told story. It kept me interested throughout the book. His descriptions and dialogue were so precise that I felt like I actually experienced Minneapolis in the 1950s and was simply recalling these already familiar places and people. The characters, flawed and so utterly consistent, offered depth and heart. One book that I read this year that I can actually recommend and read again."
0," Get Carmex Instead: I always used Carmex and never had a problem. When I was out, I went to the store and they didn't have any so I bought Vaseline Lip Therapy. It made my lips peel like crazy and I've never had that problem before nor am I in the sun much! I stopped using it and switched back to Carmex."
0," 3 Stars????: How can anyone rate this more than 1 star? This was awful in so many ways. Terrible acting, direction, story. Anything that might have worked was just sunk by the combination of the awfulness of the multiple problems. Whatever camera they used looks like a 25 year old camcorder because the film is so dark and grainy throughout. I managed to sit through the whole thing and nothing can save this one from being one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have seen junior high kids shoot a horror film among themselves that looked, sounded and had better effects than this disaster. Unless you are having an Ed Wood bad picture party, stay away from this."
0," Pathetic!: This book is not insightful in the least. It is deceptive in it's description. This is no more than lie filled meanderings from criminals who have been given too much air time already. I never even made it to the end of this book before I had to stop reading out of boredom. I do not recommend this to anyone interested in this genre. Check out books by John Douglas, Robert Ressler, Roy hazelwood and the like. Not from a housewife bored with life. Also check out The Last Victim by Jason Moss"
0, REAL LAME: I expected more then this being from the Monroe institute.I have been working wih hemi-sync and brain sync programs for years now and i found this one to be lacking .

1," GOLDEN PRAISE FOR A PLATINUM VOICE: I CAN NOT EVEN BEGIN TO ADAQUATELY APPLAUD THE VOICE, THE PASSION AND THE SELECTIONS OF THIS CD. RICK HOLDEN OF SCEPTIC@TRAVELLER.COM. PERHAPS SAID IT BEST, ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS OTHERS WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN SO TOUCHED AS TO ADD THEIR INSIGHTS TO OUR COLLECTIVE PRAISE. I AM SO DAMNED TIRED OF HAVING THESE HOLIER-THAN-THOU ""CRITICS"" AND ""PURISTS"" DENIGRATE AND OTHERWISE MALIGN A NATURAL, IF THERE BE SUCH A THING. THANK GOD FOR SUCH GIFTS, THEY DO WHAT I DEARLY WISH I COULD DO , SING WITH GOD'S VOICE OF GOD'S GIFTS AND ULTIMATE PREFECTION. THANK YOU ANDREA"
0," Worst product I've owned: I have never had a worse vacuum. It is supposed to keep odors out, instead it redistributes the odors each time you vacuum-(thats after replacing the...hepa filter after only a year).The hose that connects to the canister continually comes off as you move with the vacuum. The on/off button has sprung off. If that is not enough, there is too much work that needs to be done each time you vacuum, such as:emptying out the canister.cleaning the filter out every vacuum.The bagless vacuum (at least this one) is not, in any way, convenient."
0, Very uncomfortable: The shoe looks great and is really light BUT I found it was extremely uncomfortable around the toe area where the seam between the side and front panel is. I wore them for two days hoping they would break in but no such luck. It's a shame because I was expecting more from adidas and I really like the design of these shoes.
0," DONT BUY THIS: I have had the misfortune of buying this product, I would not suggest it to ANYONE, you could toss your money out the window and get more of a benefit. The problem is this, Garmin, however may make great GPS hardware, there software ..., Real bad! whn=en you buy a Garmin GPS, you MUST use there software, if you do not, you will not have any information as to where you are. The ...is that there software is VERY expensive, and DOSNT EVEN WORK! I bought the Mapsource Metroguide USA for about ... and then I tried to install it, I selected the region I needed on my PC and I got a prompt to insert ""disk 0"" asking for some file I DID NOT HAVE, I didnt even have that disk! I have written Garmin about this, and have not yet heard back from them. Weather they fix my problem or not is not the issue, the point is if I were in your shoes, I would go with some other product! Good luck"
1," A great book: Julius Evola again comes with one work that are not what thepeople who read about Buddhism expect. But he exposes withmagesty a vision less emotive and more strictly logic of theearly buddhist texts. Evola also compare the thinking of theoriental hindu and buddhist masters with the ocidental way ofthinking, in the religious and philosophical sense. I highlyrecomment it."
1," Good: This is really good gamepad. It feels really comfortable in your hands and it fits nicely. The only problem with it is that the rumble feature does not work with all games. Overall, this is a really good controller."
0, not happy: I ordered this product on dec 10 as an xmas gift and it still has not come. I tracked the package and it was supposed to be here on dec 15-17 and i also left feedback on the tracking page with no response.
1," IN FLAMES!: OK First I've got to say, I've been a FAN of in flames since 1999 when i saw them at a small club in seattle and let me tell you if you like old school HEAVY METAL like judas Priest and Iron Maiden, Groups like Mid-Late 1980's era Metallica & Megadeth You Will LOVE this group.. they have what most ""metal"" bands on Mtv don't have TALENT and the ability to get people to drive 100's of miles to see them in a small venue. I Recamend you also pick up Whoracle, Clayman & The Jester Race"
1, very good product: I carry this sunscreen in my golf bag. It's nice to have a handsfree sunscreen to use during a golf game so my hands don't end up slipping off my club grips.
1," A FORGOTTEN WONDER: This volume belongs to a series of 5 CDs. It is difficult to understand why these artists, the 'Comedian Harmonists', have remained so forgotten. Such a clear forerunners of madrigal groups dealing in popular music (King's Singers, Swingle Singers, etc) this sextet adds to their technical domain the charms of the European 1930's song."
0," Not even bad in a good way: First off I am a huge zombie movie fan as well as just good ole fashioned low budget films. Therefore, don't think my low rating of this is because I just don't ""get"" this kind of movie. The acting is horrible even for a low budget which you can get passed if there is nice gore and a good nudity-to-bad acting ratio, however, for this film there was not. Drop the cgi special effects and stick with fake blood and common household items. It looks better and can be taken a little more serious. Not to mention the character they tried to make into a Samuel L. Jackson got about as close as being his retarded cousin. If you want good zombie movies look to Romero if you want a decent stripper zombie movie check out Zombie Strippers instead."
0," Perhaps I stopped reading too soon ...: I abandoned the book after the fourth chapter. I am not a physicist, but I have read quite a lot about quantum theory and philosophy and Einstein's life, so I was very interested in the topic of the book. I found the author's style, however, very annoying. He does not keep to a timeline, but meanders off in five different directions page after page, and digresses left and right before telling what happened. The book reads more like a chat with a slightly tipsy gossip, who has to bring in every little bit of juicy information about the neighbors and their cats before relaying the main story. I finally gave up when the author tried to explain quantum theory by the properties of springs in the mattress where Einstein is supposedly making love to an actress! (Page 43 for those with prurient interests! ;)"
0," Groundphones: Saw the reviews here, figured 4 stars means they work.Nope. They slide out within the first few steps of running. Try jamming them in your ear, and they fall out after a few more. Garbage for their purpose. The box says the 'clip on style provides secure fit'... except they don't clip onto anything, certainly not your ears.Save your ten bucks and get something else."
0," Would not order again: I found these very uncomfortable and they made my middle look strangley rounded. Even under clothing they just made my shape look bizzare. I am a size 16 and expected these to flatten things, not round them."
0, Shallow Graves (Location Scout Mysteries): I found this book to be very disjointed and confusing with too many characters seemingly introduced merely as a method of continuing the story forward.I did not enjoy it much.
0, War Bird Spitfire: Fit of parts were marginal. Cockpit seat and back brace are mismatched will not join correctlyHad to omit cockpit entirely. Not happy with this kit.
1, Euro Pro Iron: This is the best iron ever. I simply love the extra steam and the way it speeds up my ironing time.
0," Great Sound, No Substance: Much of contemporary music (by composers who are still active) have little going for it other than individuality. Salonen knows how to work the orchestra and he produces some astonishing sounds. The music is indeed original, even if does on occasion sound a little like Rautavaara. But the Variations seem disjointed with one dazzling episode following another with any sense of continuity or cogency. It seems that the Variations would be just as effective if it were ordered randomly. The music isn't academic, but one comes away with the impression that the work could be a series of unrelated examples from an advanced orchestration textbook. Ultimately the music is highly individual, but unmemorable. Great performances though."
1," She speaks from experience not theory: What a joy to read a book Written from the trenches and joys of parenthood. This book will bring joy and Christ centered parenting to you by example.Don't miss this opportunity to impact your family ""read this book""."
0," Difficult and agitating source of learning: I bought this CD tutorial recently and found it difficult to learn via the CD. The contents the topics are very basic and they do not fulfill my thirst of learning Javascript. There's basically nothing that I could really use to produce an interesting personal web site. But then, maybe coz I'm not a CD learner. I end up printing almost every single source of code on the CD!"
0," Is it actually working?: I don't know if this thing is working, my gut tells me no. I've had it in several months now and I'm still seeing mounds and tunnels throughout my yard. Not to mention the squirrels just stand on top of these to taunt me. So no it probably isn't working at all. Wouldn't recommend in Florida."
0," Product not as advertised: This product description states that the item includes 3 yoyos and a dvd. In actuality, the only thing included in this item is a video cassette."
1," Better than Pepper by a mile: Not their most ambitious record, but one of the most enjoyable. A few misfires early on, but really picks up steam on the latter half. Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane alone make it better than Sgt. Pepper."
0," broke after 2 weeks of use: Although it worked as advertised, this is a very fragile ring. Mine broke after 2 weeks of use. I didn't abuse it or even used it very extensively. I've probably mounted my old nikkor lenses 10-15 times before it disintegrated. Had to return to seller for full refund, which i got no problem, but I can't recommend this product."
1," Excellent action: Tom Clancy fans will certainly enjoy his latest installment and those who have never read Clancy before will be drawn in by his always timely ""what-if"" plot. You don't need to have read a Clancy book in the past to enjoy this action thriller, although characters and events from past novels are referenced now and then, this novel stands on its own. Not nearly as dense as past novels nor as difficult to get into. This novel has fewer complicated characters to keep track of and begins in mid-action. The plot deals with the idea of fighting back against terrorists in an unconvential manner. Interesting and entertainig both."
0," I hated it: I bought this for my birthday, and it wouldn't even turn on. I would highly reccommend not buying it."

0," What Happened?!?!: After the disaster of the previous release, you'd think that Sage/Best would have gotten the hint.Although the latest version of Act! (2006) is slightly better than it's predecesor, it is still way too slow and even slows down all other programs that are running. A simple task like looking-up a contact becomes an exercise of frustration due to it's slower-than-slow processing even on the fastest CPU's.Act! has a great user-interface and a lot of very useful features, it's just a shame that they can never be truly appreciated because of the program's negative qualities.Best to avoid this software until Sage figures-out how to make it run smoother and faster."
0," Enjoyed Greatly and Very Frustrated!!: We had been slowly working through the first season of Cadfael and soon after we watched episode 9 the rest of the videos became unavailable through Prime. I have tried to find another avenue to express my frustration with this but decided this would be the easiest way. The videos are very well done, a little dated, but very enjoyable. If I was just rating the videos I would rate them four stars. I am very sad that the remainders are unavailable and would like to encourage Amazon to restore them!"
1," Leather stiff on top: I needed a wide sandal. Fit is good. I like being able to adjust the top with Velcro, but the leather is really stiff and rubbed my foot raw near top strap. I'm going to use some moleskin (I put it inside the sandal not on me) to help that until these (hopefully) get more pliable with walking."
0," Didnt live up to its promise: I ordered this mainly to light up the dark end of my closet. It does give good/bright lighting, but the adhesive isnt that durable. I wasnt able to use it as much as I imagined at the time I bought it."
1," Amazing Book!!: I had to read this book for my management course and I thought it was going to be yet another boring business book, but IT IS AMAZING!! The authors made me completely rethink how I think companies achieve success and had some of the most in depth research I've come across.It doesn't matter if you're in business or not, no matter who you are, you'll enjoy getting a fresh perspective that applies to business and our personal lives too. The book slows down towards the end, but overall it's a must read!"
0," ""Burn""? Hardly: This is not a workout. It has a few cute moves with lots of shoulder shrugging, but:1) the first 15 minutes have zero potential to raise your heart rate2) the other 15 minute blocks raise your heart rate for only one minute, when you put all the moves together3) the pacing is completely off -- any time you think you're going to actually work out, they start doing stretches and slow moves that blow it.I especially don't understand the worthless foot twists, bows to the floor, etc....and suspect Hemalayaa is mostly using these as an opportunity for hair flips. In short, don't waste your money (that's what you're doing, if you're actually buying this with the idea that it is about fitness). The CRUNCH videos are easily as fun, and manage to get your heart rate up and keep it there, if only for 20 minutes or so."
0, They were delivered half empty.: There's no way of knowing how well it works until you need to use it. You can't test it without discharging it and risking its future effectiveness. I bought two types of Kidde extinguishers. One for kitchen fires and another for multi-type fires and both were delivered with the gauges showing them to be half full. Its too difficult for me to return them due to my poor health condition and could not find a way to reach customer service so I'm stuck with them. I just hope I'll never need to extinguish a fire but if I do I really hope they will work.
1, Let's Play the Piano and All Those Keyboards: I have been using the library copy of this video and it is excellent. The problem I have is that there is constant reference to the written materials that go with it. The library didn't have them and the copy I have coming from another site doesn't either. It would certainly be easier to do the playing with the written music.The video has very clear explanations and practice guidelines.
1," Great: I am not a musican, but I am a Tori fan. I just love to collect. I highly recommend this book."
0," The Giver: I thought The Giver was good literature because full of feelings, also, it had lots of description, and last it had a surprise ending. First, this book was full of feelings because all of the memories had a different feeling to them. Next, this book had lot of description because when Jonas broke his leg they went into ALOT of description. Last, this book had a surprise ending. They could have given us a little more detail about what happened to Jonas and Gabe. This is why The Giver was good literature."
0, Not the correct product: While excited about purchasing the product I received the wrong item. One disc was the 2nd disc of the set and the other was a game. I'm disappointed that I wasted my time in purchasing as well as having to send it back for a refund. I probably will think twice about purchasing a dvd online again.
1," The best series ever: The only series where I have taped and saved every episode. Complex characters, strong, independent women and men with depth and spirit, intriguing storylines, witty dialogue and unexpected twists along the way. Besides outstanding performances by series regulars, an array of great guest foes and friends join the adventure."
1, Excellent mobile...: We have found this mobile to be excellent for our son's room. He finds it very entertaining as well!
1," Not pretty, but good for the composting toilet.: I've used them for eight or nine years now.They're plastic. They don't last forever. They ain't pretty. But they work.Critters are unlikely to spill them. Easy to empty--at a guess, quite a bit more easy than the really pretty 5-gallon bucket tops in Joseph Jenkins' book.5- (or 3- that are the same diameter) gallon buckets are extremely inexpensive, often free.If you're new to composting toilets, Jenkins' book recommends letting humanure compost age for a year."
0," terrible flash camera: i bought this camera to record my surfing, it says 8 X zoom , but when you zoom the camera it get all wrong with the focal distance.about the lcd, all i have to say is that you can not see nothing if is too sunny, how you can get anything if you can not see what is going on.and the battery life i think is some kind of joke, i recorder no more than five minutes and is all gone.And the worst part is that i live in brazil and can not return the product."
1, GREAT MOUSE FOR PRICE: vERY GOOD GAMING MOUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. RUNS SMOOTH AND HAS ENOUGH SETTINGS TO HELP GIVE YOU AN EDGE.
1, Works Good: I saw some earlier reviews on these that said they break. I was hesitant to buy but I couldn't find anything else I liked that was so cute. I put it up by the top of the door and have not had any problems with it at all. I can see how these could break if the legs and arms are pulled too far apart. There doesn't seem to be much flexibility to it but I do not take it on and off very often so it works well for me.
1, Best Miniseries Ever: Fantastic show. Incredibly well made. Arrived in the condition described. One day later than expected. Love it.
1, super spice rack: this is one of the best kitchen gadgets I've ever bought!! on my christmas list I've askedfor another one to stack on top. I have soooo many spices in the cupboard that I willneed 2 of these to help keep all my spices organized.Even my sister is looking into getting the white one.thank youkim
0," Terrible Technical Support!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The range and throughput of this router were awful. I bought it to replace an aging Linksys WRT54G, and was absolutely appalled at it's performance. After spending almost three hours on the phone with technical support people who were not even as knowledgeable as I was and who barely spoke English (obviously outsourced to India), I gave up and decided to send it back. Amazon did a great job with the return, but the router is not worth the money, effort, or trouble. Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1," Wait for the Video Rebuttal: For the New Yorker who wrote the review entitled ""Wait for the Video, is defintely not a Christian. And also, is probably not married. This is an excellent book. The author is not trying to make you believe what she is saying, but sharing an experience, like most autobiographies.Maybe you should keep your personal comments to your self...non-believer."
0, Halo 2 for Vista: This crashes a lot. I was never able to play for more than 10 minutes before it would crash. I tried it on both windows Vista and Windows 7. Same result.
1, Great Dryfire Product: Makes practice very easy to do anywhere. This allows you to hone your trigger control and is great for any type of handgun.
1," Better than the Hoover, but not the whole answer.: Prior to getting this cleaner, I was using a Hoover F7425-900 Dual V. After having leaks fixed twice, and knowing the attachments were useless because all of the water ended up on the floor instead of the tank, I finally decided on the Bissell ProHeat 2X Select. Overall, I like this machine. The tools work great and vacuumed water actually goes into the tank. It cleans the carpets really well, but leaves too much water in it so it takes forever to dry. Since the Hoover machine vacuums most of the water out of the carpet leaving it almost dry, I now use both machines (UGH, more storage space needed). I use the Bissell to do the cleaning and the Hoover to pick up the water. It sure would be great if someone would produce a machine that cleaned carpets, the tools worked, and the most of the water was removed from the carpet. Imagine, one machine that would do it all!!!! (Oh, I have another smaller cleaner for small jobs)"
0," Possibly Worst DVD Set Production EVER!: And not because of the content of the DVDs. The movies themselves are fine; although deep down inside everyone was a little disappointed in Superman Returns. I have purchased and exchanged this set 3 TIMES! First time, not all of the DVDs were functional. Second time, DVDs' special features fiasco. Third time, the DVDs' case was broken and the discs were loose and got scratched. Tired of this, I finally kept the set that I had on hand. However, it's worth noting that the DVDs were out of order in the case, which makes some peoples' complaints about receiving duplicate discs and missing others more plausible.How could Warner Bros. mess this up so badly? It's Superman for crying out loud!! He is one of their flagship franchises! I have hundreds of DVDs and have never experienced this much difficulty in finding a quality copy of a boxed set. I will think long and hard before buying any more DVD sets from Warner Bros."
1," One Night of Scandal: loved this book, couldn't put it down till I finished it! Got sucked into the story finishing it with a smile left on my face! Can't go wrong with this author! what an awesome love story!"
0," Just buy the remote - the game's not worth the extra $10: I should have read the reviews of this product. If you need an extra remote just buy it, this game isn't worth and extra ten cents, much less ten dollars."
1," Love this envelope holder.: Its a sturdy unit, looks classy and elegant, holds plenty of letters/mail, and is overall an excellent buy. Very recommended. NOT very big, but perfectly sized."
0, too much money!: Why is it that all these TOYS!!! are $300?!?!?! my son loves star wars. hes 5 yrs old and all he wants for his birthday is star wars toys. so i go online and all i can find are $300-$500 star wars toys that are about 2 inches tall. they are frickin toys people. thanks for making it impossible for my son to get what he wants for his birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0," Don't bother: I bought this item at a local retailer. After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try and open a can. It was difficult, and I gave up after a few attempts. I returned the item and got a different brand."
0," Depends On What kind of a baby is getting the toy...: My little brother was always bored, so we went to the store and we bought him this. He didn't even touch it! He was probally 10 monthes at the time. He is more of an adventure baby. It might be because he lives with a very big family and is not delighted by little joys of life. He just wasn't interested! (It depends on the baby..)"
1," It will take you to another planet!: Turn out the lights, put your headphones on, and let the first 5 songs take you one step beyond. Emerald Eyes and Hypnotized alone are worth the price. Listen to the samples if you have sound!"
0, Leonard misses the mark.: Leonard's greatest strength has always been his ability to breath life into those on the fringes of modern society. He has always understood their rythmns and their patois. These strengths are completely wasted in this tale of Cuba 100 years ago.
0," Polar Express Shadow Book: I wish I could have gotten my hands on a local copy before buying it online. The proper affect was difficult to execute using an ordinary flashlight. The direct beam of a flashlight washes out the images. A more diffused light source is needed. The only solution I could find was to use a box with a cutout window and a light mounted inside not directly in line with the window. Using the indirect light source allowed a more diffused light which was able to create the shadow affect. In the end I did not use it because I did not have time once I received the book and was able to test it. I also would have to take the book apart. It was too unwieldly. A nice idea, but the execution was poor."
1," Satisfied: I used to watch this show with my niece years ago and bought the dvd for my daughter. Though she is still young to understand it, I'm sure as she gets older she will love it. It's a cute show and I recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good kids show."
1," The Healthy Traveler: This is a handy, packable and easy-to-use book filled with easy to follow directions for most any travel ailment. This compact book covers everything from altitude sickness to parasites, with remedies from herbs to homeopathy and essential oils. I will certainly pack it along on all of my journeys.--Mary Wulff-Tilford, DiHom.; Professional Herbalist, AHG (...)"
1," remarkable: How remarkable it was to find a book with my dog's name and face on it's jacket peeking at me in a bookstore. Of course I had to buy it! I wasn't disappointed. I found a book of wisdom to share with friends and reread when the spirit requires. I only wish our lives were filled with more ""head-tilts"" like this."
1," Highly recommended, even if you're not a MSTie: I loved the MST3K series, and greatly mourn its passing. However, this book shows that Mike Nelson is more than just a prisoner on the Satellite of Love. His observations on everyday life are spot on and laugh out loud funny.As in any book of this type, there are a few essays that are less than funny, but they're greatly outnumbered by the ones that have you snorting milk out your nose while reading. (Assuming you're drinking milk, of course)The essay format makes this a perfect book to read during off moments, as long as you don't mind odd looks from passersby as you snicker and chortle. Well worth reading and adding to your comedy library."
1, Splash guard is great: This is perfect if you have toddlers that want to eat cherries. The splash guard makes it easy to keep the cherry juice away from your clothes and countertops.
1," ready for healing and love: If you want to meditate and clean your fears away and learn how to be connected to love this CD will help you a lot you can call these beautiful angels anytime and they will be with you at all times, my ex died and has been hard to keep going so with this CD I feel different and has accepted that He is in a much better place and all healing starts from yourself, loving yourself forgiving yourself for wrong decisions you have made in life, love yourself and then you can love others, forgive yourself also others and clean all fears from the past. Great Healing CD it may bring lots of blessings and also bring the truth and the light in your life"
0," What an utter load of crap.: Gun toting children, talking gorillas, steam-powered (?) aircars and mile-long zeppelins: You'll find all of these while reading this book. Now it's OK if this was, say, a Douglas Adams book, but smith takes his ludicrous alternate history seriously. In Smith's opinion, if we only switched to an anarchist form of government, every human ailment would disappear instantaniously, along with some annoying laws of nature such as the conservation of energy, or the fact that animals can't think like humans. As to the characters... every character was ripped right out of a Heinlein book, and the bad guys are simply pathetic. I'd call it a ""mustn't read"". I'm sorry I ever did - although I got some cheap laughs out of it."
1," Very REFRESHING!: It's about time a good R&B album came out! Carl Thomas was the last good album that I got. Bobby's voice is a great. The production is amazing. Excellent beats, and pretty good song writing. The same producers did the whole album, so its a pretty consistent album. This album is worth buying!"
0," This was a waste.......: Pete Hamill is a good writer, I read him all the time in the Daily News and enjoy seeing him expound on the history of NYC on the NY PBS specials, etc - I even liked seeing him in ""King of New York"". However, this book, and the idea for the story, though it was amazing, was a blown opportunity. Making Cormac a figure that rubbed elbows with George Washington, Boss Tweed, etc., was too much, and the 'suspense' leading up to September 11 was a bit ridiculous. His writing seemed like he had to ensure 550+ pages to his publisher, at times. The story from Ireland to NY was great, but he really got carrid away and made too much of well known history (Draft Riots, Tammany, and others) and not enough of daily life. I felt like I was 300 years old by the time I finished the disappointing ending, and, as a New Yorker and someone that works downtown Manhattan, almost insulted by the ending. Nevertheless, I still like Pete, I just wouldn't recommed this book."
1," Pure Kenton: A cross between big band and jazz at it's finest. This wil put you in the mood, no matter what your mood is. From the period before he went a little over the top. A must for every Kenton lover."
1," Denise Autstin's Burn Fat Fast- Cardio Blast: I had originally checked this video out from the library. I knew that I wanted to own it. While I still enjoy the workouts and appreciate the warm-ups and cool-downs, I am disappointed that after only two months, the picture quality is starting to act up. That, however, is independent of the video's workouts themselves."
0," Disappointing: I think B Stewart's review sums up a lot of the problems here, and I agree with what he says.My feeling is that 99 Keys was intended to be a coffee table book. The writing is pretty terrible, and the organization is even worse. The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a high school paper on Steinway -- some kid sat down with a bunch of books and did his best to distill them all in to one text. I don't think this would have been published had it not been a Steinway descendant at the helm.I'm also not a fan of the constant marketing angle. 88 keys is like a big ol' brochure; saying nothing remotely negative or even insightful.And I'm tired of the illustrations. Why is everything a drawing? Why are key illustrations left out, but some of the page is occupied by a ""timeline"" which is totally meaningless and useless.Out of all the books I've read on pianos, this is the worst."
0," details details: A fast paced, intensely detail orientated book by long time cyber fiction writer Gibson. The story plot is a mixture of Japanses pop culture/ Russian espionage with an innocent girl and confused man caught in the middle. The plot seems like a decoy for Gibson to speculate about future gadgets and new technology. The writing is choppy and boring. The characters are not thought out, and several meaningless red herrings are thrown in just for the heck of it. Overall, I found it not very stimulating. But maybe it's just me."
0," Upgrade to the Professional Version: These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
0," good idea, lousy execution: this connects through an usb port to a plug-in in the cooler. unfortunately, the plug-in part is held in place with hot glue. hot glue (as anyone who's used it should know) does not stick to plastic very well. on about the fourth or fifth time i plugged it in, the little post had retreated inside the box, making it impossible to connect. i opened the case (why it takes nine screws to hold this thing together is beyond me) & found that the plug was running free. i tried to tuck it back into place, but it kept slipping out. the area could easily have been designed to be solid support, but apparently whoever was working on the original plans was too interested in figuring out how many screws could be worked into the design. bottom line -- it wasn't worth the money. heck -- it wasn't even worth the time it took to take it out of the box. never again."
0, strong but thats it: horrible at holding knots. very thick daimeter i order 25 and its thicker than my stren 40lb test. i would never buy this again. all my knots would slip and i would lose my tackle no matter how many knots i put in it.
1," You can't outsnake me (hiss hiss, rattle rattle): A great movie (almost as good as Maid to Order) Lily Tomlin should have won an Oscar for her dual roles, especially as country Rose when she makes her fingers in fangs and hisses while rattling her bracelets like a snake. She also talks to the fruit in her hotel room thinking it's bugged!) This movie is for anyone who has been given a half stick of gum by somebody and wondered what's the point of that?! 'What flowers do you want? Roses or Carnations?' 'Roses!' 'Hey! I'm Rose!' It's a great film! Fine cinema!"
1," Great envelopes; great value: This is the best value/price I've found on envelopes. I have a greeting card ministry and enjoy using quality envelopes. These aren't necessarily 'formal-invitation-level quality', but they're certainly not the cheap-looking envelopes that don't seal, either. A box of 100 goes a long way, even for me. I forget the math I did on price-per-envelope, but if memory serves, it's incredibly less than the 'good' envelopes I was buying, and even much less than the usual 'okay' envelopes I could buy at my local chain store. That allows me to put money where it counts more..in the cards themselves."
0," This album has exactly one good song.: This album has exactly one good song, ""Don't You Want Me."" Actually, it's a great song. But the rest of the disc is filler material. What a shame."
1," Expecting great things: I've only known about Trail of Dead for a few months. I was impressed by the band's recent show in Denver, although they couldn't duplicate the nuances and softer moments of ""Source Tags and Codes."" After hearing the newest CD, I immediately bought their previous CDs, and ""Source Tags and Codes"" is such a great leap forward that I'm excited to think of what the next work will sound like. I think this band has a distinctive sound and I'm surprised by the vitriol in some of the negative reviews here."
1, Soul Surfer: This movie was an inspirational film and we both liked it very much. The story presented is absoulutely wonderful to watch.
1," One of the best books I've read in a while!: To say I enjoyed this book is an understatement. I devoured it. The plot is tightly wound with sub-plots and counter-plots and counter-counter-plots. The setting and the characters are rich and detailed and ring true to the period. Without a whole lot of lecturing, Ackroyd gives us an overview of the connections and interplay of the church and state in 14th century England. Don't miss this one."
1, Excellent Product!!: This cable is an extremely great product for the price. The picture and audio quality is exceptional! You would be out of your mind to purchase anything more expensive than this cable.
1," Very good product: I am very happy with this product. I needed gates for two openings that were 48"" wide. 48"" is too wide for any other pressure mounted gate that I could find. Since I only need the gates for occasional visits from an out of town grandbaby, I didn't want permanently mounted gates.We used them for 10 days over the holidays and they worked great. They were very sturdy and easy to mount. And since the top and bottom rail work independently of eachother, it is not an issue that the bottom rail had to be a little narrower due to the baseboards.I would highly recommend these gates and they were very inexpensive too!"
0," Oh my god this is pathetic!: I didn't think it was actually possible to make a movie worse then The Mummy. But when I rented this utter fiasco of a movie that is what I got. It actually offended me because it was so insulting to the intelligence of the person watching. Weak characters, terrible acting, cheesy special effects, and don't even get me started about the screenplay. I am dumbfounded that this movie was ever made, and I am floored by the fact it made 180 million at the box office. There is one nice thing about the movie though, Rachel Weisz's cleavage."
0," A common flaw: My pepper mill took a few more months, it seems, to get stuck in coarse-grind mode, but is now firmly stuck there, dispensing only tooth-jarring chunks of pepper. I tried everything short of breaking the thing open. I'm going to try to get a replacement from the company, and if I do, then I'll give it another shot, but I'm really regretting not just shelling out an extra few bucks for something better. If the replacement breaks, I'm going to bite the bullet and buy a Perfex."
1," blu ray remastered ... almost very good: Honestly, most of the movie is very nice in the blu ray format. But it is I think quiet a shame when right at the beginning you have this nice overview of the temple and the sky is just THE NOISIEST SKY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE. I mean come on, even a movie that has 640x480 pixels of resolution will display better than that ... later in the first space scene, the white halo around the reactors of the Mondo-shawans spaceship is really noisy too. But when you pass that I guess it is ok. I never had the impression when watching a DVD before that there were good or bad transfers. Since I have the blu ray player and a TV that can actually display some real 1080p I see that at least in the blu ray collection you have good or bad transfers. Luckily we have Amazon reviews to know which one are the good and which are the bad ... about the movie, well I like it a lot so not to much to say about that."
1, Complete and easy to follow: This is a well written & well organized exercise book. It is easy to follow and reasonable to use. The pictures are clear and concise making it easily accessible.
1," HOT!!: Anyone who thinks white girls can't sing R&B hasn't heard Wild Orchid. Stacy Ferguson, Renee Sandstrom, and Stefanie Ridel may look like Charlie's Angels, but they belt with the fervor of a gospel choir. A few ballads on their debut droop, but smooth harmonies and slick arrangements on ""Supernatural"" and ""Talk to Me"" provide true flower power, both were huge hit's on the Billboard Pop Chart aswell as the 20 week BIllboard Pop chart lasting ""At Night I Pray""!"
1," The Rachel Papers: Perhaps not on par with the novel but more accessible. Although brilliant and highly original, I think Martin Amis' first book contains some obscure passages and insider English schoolboy jokes. Also, the 1970's setting of the book has been replaced by the 1980's in the movie.Ione Skye and Dexter Fletcher portray the growing relationship between Rachel & Charles rather well. James Spader fills in nicely as DeForest, the rival boyfriend. The college scene with Michael Gambon as Doctor Knowd is particularly humorous.A good study in adolescence."
1," Ash grow up but don't sell out: Nu-Clear Sounds is a great album. It's got an abundance of hooks, sweet love songs, and little boy vocals. The songs still have a feeling of boyhood charm, but it works on the most important level; it moves forward and takes risks. The band have added another guitar player, Charlotte Hatherly, and gone are their sci-fi lyrics and teenybopper charm. Tim has shed his teen hearthrob image but still kept some of the charm; you can hear the youthful optimism in songs like Wild Surf and Numbskull. He can still make the girls swoon too. Aphrodite and I'm Gonna Fall are achingly gorgeous. Unfortunately, some of those girls won't understand songs like Jesus Says and Death Trip 21, which employs a D.J. and sounds more like the Chemical Brothers. It's a shame such forward thinking risktaking got them dropped from their American record label and saw them slide down the charts in the U.K. Thankfully, this album proves Ash will be in it for the long haul, not a flash in the pan."
1, Worked as needed: Used for PA school and worked as needed. Good product at a good price. Better quality than alot of others.
1," What a GREAT story!: This gripped me from beginning to end: a very finely drawn portrait of a man of unusual quality. Anyone who's ever been drawn to the ""outlaw"" mystique will appreciate the opportunity to see how it begins, lives, and ends in Wayne Padgett, the author's father. A terrific read."
1," A decent quick read: I'm more used to Chevalier's heavier writing (like Fallen Angels), but this was an ok story. I did enjoy the medieval story line much more than the modern day counterpart. I did not like the heroin Ella very much, nor did I identify with her problems and choices. I was also a little disappointed that the end was so ambiguous, but overall the writing was good and so my breakdown is 5 stars for Isabella's story, 3 stars for Ella's, an average of 4 will have to do."
1," Excellent! A must-read: My husband, who is currently a resident of a rehab facility, was given this by his Social Worker and I happened to read it when visiting him. It's very short and each subject is one page long so it's an easy read, especially for people with short attention spans. It's actually two books in one. Halfway through, you turn the book over and the second book is in the back. One deals with helping a man (or someone who deals with grief in a masculine way) and the other is for a man dealing with their own grief. It makes for a great read and highlights areas you may not have thought of for areas that a person needs to grieve the loss of. It was definitely an eye-opener for me and has been very helpful in dealing with my husbands condition."
1," Just...wow!: Okai. I am a huge John Saul fan and after reading a number of his books, I always favored Second Child, the first book I ever read by him, the most. And then, this book came along and REALLY had me deciding which one I liked better. It was fabulous! Most of John Saul's books are of released evil or multiple personalities or something of that nature. This one was not. The God Project was more like something that, after much research and some very intellegent (not to mention psychologically damaged) scientists and doctors can get together and ""toy"" with peoples' DNA and so forth...affecting future off spring, causing them to become....basically, super human. It was quite the chiller and I could not put it down. I was up all night reading and I could not put the book down until I had finished. If you have never read a John Saul book, this would be a great one to start with. If you are already a John Saul reader, don't forget to squeeze this one in there! You won't be disappointed."
1, without reservations: This is a suberb album with some of the most heartfelt songs in the world on it! My dad left this to me and I love it!
0," Major Disappointment: I was expecting the original recordings. There was nothing to indicate that these were re-recordings. The track for 'Il Silenzio' was the sole reason I purchased the CD and it was nothing like I had hoped. Someone, Bear Family perhaps, will re-release 'Il Silenzio' and 'Spanish Brass'."
1," Native American Designs 2: This book was written with quilters in mind. It has some introductory information on how to use the patterns and a little history. The patterns are taken from or based on indian artistry mainly in pottery, silverwork and basketry. The 100 plus patterns may be copied for personal use only. Using my own imagination, I can picture some of these interesting patterns being used for stenciling on a wall, inspiration for artwork as well as the quilt stitching that it was designed for. I am sure that I will put some of these patterns to use."
1," Great resource: I've been using this book for several years along with Trafford Cole's book about Italian records. Without these two books, I would not have had nearly as much success extracting information from reels of difficult-to-read records on microfilm. They are especially helpful dissecting the different types of records and the distinctive handwriting. There's tons of other indispensable information you'll need to know when embarking on any serious study of your Italian ancestors."
1," Problem Solving Hint: My son has two of these in his condo. When installing new batteries, he complained that they beeped randomly. One detector was brand new and the other was older.I had him double check the battery orientation and that was the problem. Be sure to double check your batteries as you install them."
1," great: the game is awesome! the story is a bit short but the gameplay is spectacular, not much to complain about with this game"
0, Aussie Kaz: WHY are the artists names presented with spelling mistakes? What an insult! SUZI QUATRO and SHEENA EASTON are the artist's names and correct spelling - not as shown in the Product Details box.
0," Graduate students clipped newspapers?: A very disappointing set of books, reads like strung together clippings of (primarily) political events from newspapers. Inconsistent in places, dead wrong in others, practically no synthesis. OK perhaps if you want an outline of some of the major events and when they occurred, but to get the significance and any depth of analysis, you'll have to look elsewhere. One of the strangest excuses for ""History"" I've ever read."
1, Great watch for skinny runners/swimmers: I got this watch because I needed a new watch to train with for my tris. This watch has met all my expectations. I love it. It isn't flashy but the size and the functionality are just right. I am pleased.
1, Love it: Very cool and very functional. Displays you wine in a fun way! Easy to install.Nice way to display your wine without using needed counter space.
1," No more lugging in heavy packs of water!: This Pur system was easy to use. Just open the box and soak the filter and twist it into the dispenser. Water tastes GREAT. I had a glass of Pur-filtered water and a glass of tap water and I drank from both for a little taste test--you can taste the difference. The tap water was nasty! I live in Oakland, CA so I'm sure it's not really toxic but with water tasting that nasty I wouldn't be drinking too much water.The main reason why I bought this was because I moved into an upstairs condo and the distance from where I park my car and my residence is about 20 yards, including a flight of stairs. It became too much for me plus I have a condition that does not allow me to carry heavy items for long. This solves the problem!! Just re-fill in the sink and place back into fridge. Fits nice in my fridge, didn't even have to re-adjust any shelves!"
1," Best. Movie. Ever.: Wow, this movie is so good! I have been watching this series form when i was just a little grasshopper. I've seen it so many times and it never gets old. The acting is great, the comedy is fun, the racing is awesome, the whole movie rocks. I so recommend this to you if you have kids, and then watch it with them and you will end up liking it to (if not more) and even if you dont have kids.....GET IT!!!, it is so good and you wont regret it!"
1," Quite Unnerving: I have just finished reading all of the Tom Clancy books, and I have to say this is my favorite. During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."
1," Don't watch it if you're dead: I am amazed at some of the negative reviews I have read about this film. I found this film to be completely overwhelming in it's beauty of ideas, photography and soundtrack.Perhaps it's the main character's metamorphisis to a 'killer of white men' that scares those who have written negative reviews. Perhaps their notions of humanity don't extend beyond the limits set by 'white men' and their 'machines', but who am I to judge?If you don't like to think too much and would rather have action and hot chicks force fed into your corpse, don't watch it, however, if you reckon you can handle an interesting perspective, beautiful scenes and a wickedly moody soundtrack (performed by a musical genious), check it out.Don't watch it if you're dead, it'll hurt!"
1, A classic: I wish George Lukas will someday go back to make other movies like that. A must have in any SF collection.
0, Horrible: This was one of the worse books I've read. I will not be buying anthing by this author again.
1," My Favorite Version: Many times I watched the 1944 version, it's o.k., but not great (if compared with ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Forever Amber"" or ""Désirée"").A few years ago I finally discovered to my delight in Netflix that there is a remake with Alain Delon's son Anthony Delon. The actress who played Lady Dona St. Columb (Tara Fitzgerald) was somebody I had never heard of at that point.Well, I instantly enjoyed this version and was so thrilled that it has been filmed where it should have been filmed in the first place: in Cornwall where all those fascinating stories of Daphne DuMaurier take place.Of course the 1944 version could not have been filmed in Cornwall as WW II was going on, but it always bothered me to see the Californian coastline which is very different from Cornwall's coast.I wish somebody would finally make a movie from ""The House on the Strand"" (my favorite DuMaurier novel)."
1," Inspirational!!: Ray Kybartas delivers on his promise: this book is a wonderful compendium of practical advice and motivational incentives for a healthy lifestyle. Truly inspirational in tone and images, this book is great if you're looking for reasons to start a fitness routine anew or energize a lagging one. However, some of the diet recommendations are questionable as far as fitting yourself into protein categories - the nutrition advice should be looked at as healthy guidelines and not gospel formulas. But as a fresh point of view on the hackneyed personal fitness market, Ray is da' bomb. Fabulous photos! (California dreamin'...) Read it and be invigorated."
1," Question about subtitles: I have these on VHS and am wanting to buy them on DVD because I love the cheesiness! However, I am also wanting to share them with my mother whom is deaf. I cannot find out if this set has subtitles from the description. Can any of you tell me if there are subtitles or closed captioning for these? Many thanks!"
0," ***Does NOT work with Vista***: I was given one of these as a gift last year, and had a wonderful year playing Animal CrossingWW with friends around the world....until my husband gave me a new computer for our 18th wedding aniversary. Then my little world, with all my friends, disappeared, because it can't be set up to work with Vista and Norton. I have spoken with Nintendo, Gateway, and others about this, and everyone agrees that its a lost cause, and to switch to a wireless router.This gadget is fantastic, so long as you are playing Win XP. If that is your OS, then go for it, and have fun! But it is not supported by Nintendo, despite their having an 'upgrade' available for Vista users, and they admit its of little help, and tell you go get a wireless router. They no longer make these, and told me they will not be supporting them much longer, because it poses some kind of security risk to users. *sigh*it was too good to be true..."
0," An Engineering Disaster: This cheese grater is an unmitigated engineering disaster. The mechanical ""snaps"" on the fold in handles are made of plastic. Within days, _both_ grating wheel had their handle ""snaps"" break right off. The rubber (in gray in the pic) gripper for the handle also pops off. The design may have been clever if the snap parts were made of metal or something that didn't break the minute the device was used with a piece of cheese."
0," Not much yoga here: This dvd was a dissappointment. There are lots of gimmicks, strange adults trying too hard, kids doing break dance and other non-yoga related moves. Basically there is minimal yoga, the format is all over the place, it's not fun or easy to follow."
1," great for fishing kayak: The anchor seemed a little smaller than I was expecting but I did want one small and as lightweight as possible for use on a fishing kayak. My brother and I have been known to paddle miles up rivers and bay estuaries where current can be a force to recon with and it's important to keep the gear loadout to a minimum. However, the anchor is a necessary evil for being able to hold your position in current and get some good fishing in. We both got these anchors at the same time and have used them in various bodies of water over the last month.So far, this anchor has never let us down. Even when the current has been quite strong, it has never budged. I wouldn't go anywhere fishing without it now.I would have preferred a choice of colors and a longer rope with a float at the end but neither have been necessary.For a fishing kayak, this one is it!"
1," Tretment Theraphy: We use this product in our facility for the kiddos to make masks of their faces. After they are finished, the inside represents who they were and the outside represents who they are going to be. This product works great for our applicable needs."
1," good price: it only cost a dollar so why not, and it's not defective. plus it's working well with our television :)it makes it clearer and i can really feel the game by using this cable."
1," Patching Problem Solver: I needed to slightly modify this item for my own specific needs, but it still proved to be a quality and professional solution for my patching/signal routing needs. Monster does it again!"
0," Don't Bother...: I bought this book shortly after I learned I was hypo-thyroid. I had high expectations, because of hearing about Mary's books on her forums. I was severely disappointed. This book didn't tell me anything new...I had read the website,Stop The Thyroid Madness.... and that website had vast information vs. Mary's book. I also bought one of her e-books about Thyroid and Hair loss and was also disappointed. It didn't tell me anything new, at all. Her forum site has become a vehicle to sell her books, and not a open forum on thyroid health...New information is not allowed to be exchanged on the list if it pertains to other than Mary's books or websites....very Sad. I will look elsewhere for up-to-date relevant thyroid information.Stop the Thyroid Madness: A Patient Revolution Against Decades of Inferior Treatment"
0," Only provies general info regarding menopause!: I found the video to be a disappointment. Especially after reading the wonderful reviews it received. If your doctor has already explained the basics of menopause, this is not the video for you. The video does not provide any techniques or suggestions in dealing with menopause, how menopause might prpgresess etc. I was hoping for more in depth information and what I got was a refresher on what I already knew."
0, Not a good pillow for comfort: This pillow is like resting on styrofoam. It is hard and uncomfortable. I sent this back and ordered another product that was much better.
1," Run SMALL and NOT for winter: Learned the hard way--these run small, so order the next size up (at least). These will be great for spring and fall but after a less-than-30 minute walk in the woods at 25 degrees, my fingers were cold. Not winter gloves."
0," good hat, but....: Everything was ok except the measurement. Way too big for my head, definitely not a 7 1/4 like I ordered."
1," Lives up to the rating: This is a good read, especially if you enjoy the Bond movies. The writing style keeps things moving. I would buy more."
0, Cheesy and kinda boring: He has a nice voice. Very pleasant. But the music was cheesy and boring. Sorry but it just wasn't very enjoyable.
1, Does the job as advertised: Great tool for monitoring the min/max temps in an area. I use it in my brew closet so I know what kind of temps my fermentor is getting throughout the day/night. The min/max hands are a bit twitchy and can stick or jump pretty easily when resetting them but this isn't a huge inconvenience. Once reset it seems to accurately read the min/mix range without slippage or sticking.The provided hardware is great for mounting the thermometer and the swing arm style is handy for putting it somewhere out of the way but still being able to get to it to read it.
0," Definitely not a page turner: I bought this book with great anticipation; I was greatly disappointed. Someone said earlier that the book seems like a slice of the character's life with no ups and downs. That's true. There is no climax, no story line that grips you.At some points I was irritated by the number of times people called the character 'mature' when there was nothing to show to the readers that she was mature.The idea of story is good- sex in the mind of an Indian lesbian teenager. It is just not well written."
1," Incredible music dvd: Now when i picked up this dvd which includes all there videos from 94 to 2000 ( it also includes the KoRn video who then now) i was worried it would be smashed together and have no glue to stick it all together but i was wrong this thing was put together very well it goes through the KoRn story from 96 to pre untouchables release. Its funny, its cool & it impressed me. Quite possible the greatest dvd brought to you buy the greatest band of all tiem, if you love KoRn buy this, if you just want to know more about KoRn this is the dvd for you!"
0, don't bother: Blue Rodeo has a small fan base in the U.S. and I am one of them; been with them since Diamond Mine. Their music is great but they can't put out a decent DVD; this one is home movies with so-so sound. Their more professional one released a few years ago was so difficult to navigate I just gave up on it. Hey Blue Rodeo; why don't you get a professional crew and do a straight electric concert in DTS or Dolby Digital? Don't waste your money on this one
1, Beautiful!: This book takes the classic story and sets it to wonderfully illustrated pictures. We love it.
1," Gunman Hits You Point Blank: This is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Anytime I meet someone who hasn't seen 'Gunmen' I don't care who they are, I see to it they watch this movie... I've never had a dissapointed fan. The movie is fast paced slowing only to give you enough time to rememeber there realy is a good plot here too otherwise the movie is a rollercoster of fun, the actors mesh well from scenes with Chris and Mario to Mario and Denis to Denis and Chris and on and on. It's hard to see Patrick Steward as the bad guy at first, but you get over it quick. It has my favorite running gag in an action movie - The First Aid Kit! (I'll let you watch it.) A must have for any Lambert Fan, Action Fan, Leary Fan or Self-Proclaimed 'Movie Buf'"
1," It was great!: I love the whole series so far, I'm only up to 4 The Secret of the Unicorn. Circles in the Stream was great,they describe everything very well(not just in this one but the whole series).My fave characters are Lyra,Storm,Adriane,Emily,and Kara.I can't wait to see what happens in Spellsinger and Trial by Fire, anyway I just HAD too tell all of you Avalon lovers that I loved it! Shelly and Rachel Roberts keep making those books they are WONDERFUL!!!!"
1, OUSTANDING AND INFORMATIVE: This book offers an outstanding view of Clemson football. It was the most interesting book I have seen about Clemson. I highly recommed it and have given it to many devoted Clemson fans as a gift. Needless to say they all enjoyed it. It is great to learn so much about Clemson from such a great teacher (Bob Bradley). You could not have a more qualified source.
1," Schizophrenic....you got that right.: This cd is Schizophenic alright. All the songs are different and crazy in their own little way. The cd is pretty good although I will admit that all the songs aren't that great and I can't see them being #1 hits. I did like ""Build My World"" and ""She Got Me"" the most. I thought ""She Got Me"" had that Justin Timberlake vibe to it. I really think ""100 Ways"" sound like a song Prince would do. I heard JC got his inspiration from ""The Ladies Man"" movie when he wrote ""One Night Stand"". It sounds pretty good for just ""playing around"" in the studio. I always wondered what JC is thinking. Now I know when I hear A.D.I.D.A.S. This cd basically talked about love and sex. I think it was made basically for grown folks. I would recommend it cuz I mean it's not a bad cd for someone going solo for the first time."
0," Sangean ATS 909: I have purchased this in the UK and find the radio to be very disappointing.It is reasonably sensitive on am and fm both shortwave and elsewhere. I could notice distortion on fades on the speaker.I also found that the quality for recording was far too bassy even with the tone adjustment to music and the band selection to wide. The quality from line output does not match the sound on the speaker.The switches on the side for tone, stereo to mono are only very thin plastic. The battery cover is small and flimsy as is the stand.Spend your money on a Sony 7600G or 100E. I realise now why people who buy the Roberts equivalent say it is a Sanean in wolf's clothing.I wish I had heeded advice on the web before buying."
0," Has its uses, but overall pathetically bad history.: Steeped in British-Israelist presumption and annoyingly repetitive in its insistence in seeing ""divine guidance"" every time someone notable in American history so much as belched, this volume is easy to read, but also a very good example of what little or no real research on your subject will produce. McNair's ""history"" repeats historical fable and falsehood without the slightest hint that the author did anything more than consult a library book here and there. Its only clear positive is that the chapters do flow from one to the next well enough that one isn't lost in a lot of dates and pieced-together information."
0, Bad use of airborne troops: Very much the most excellent good guys against the very bad bad guys. Both use troops up badly.
0," Disappointed: I bought this grill so that I could grill veggies and fish outdoors without the fuss of charcoal. But I have tried chicken fajitas and calamari on skewers, and both times the grill didn't get hot enough. I had to finish them both on the indoor stove. Next time I'll research better before shopping."
1," An inspiring beat...: Upon hearing this CD played through once, the following description came to mind: heavy-metal religious music as written by Middle-Earth bards. Many of the songs on this album DO have heavy religious overtones, but that hardly takes away from its total feel. The music and lyrics sing of great quests without the obscene references usually found in heavy-metal music. A great work."
1, Not heavy and very non-stick: This pan is great. Its very lightweight. I used a tiny bit of vegetable spray and the cake don't stick at all. Very pleased with this product.
0," Double Standard: Ann Coulter is an anti-Muslim and an anti-Arab.If she tried to publish an anti-semitic book it would never jive. And rightfully so of course. Any type of ignorant, blatant hatred is stupid.Here is her brilliant ""defining"" quote referring to Arabs:""we should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.""Terrorists do NOT define what Islam is. Nor do the more than one billion Muslims around the world who are not terrorists. The book was closed on what Islam is the day that Mohammad died. Regardless of what you believe, the truth of the matter is that Mohammad was a human being who had a lot of good qualities. He was pro-women before anyone was pro-women, he accepted peoples rights to freedom of religion when there was no such thing and always taught Muslims to respect Jews and Christians explicitly. These are irrefutable facts.If some people who today call themselves Muslims do not live this way, don't blame it on Islam."
1," close trimmer, just what i needed: nice trimmer, seems better-made than my last one, and cuts REALLY close. i read the manual first, and good thing! it shows how the blades were to be aligned when cleaning and UPON RECEIPT...my machine was not adjusted acceptably when put together? yup. no biggie but why not put it together just right the 1st time? anyway, seems that after i bought it they finally restocked the look-alike of this razor with another brand name on it?---at wal*mart. i think the prices were close? i'm satisfied overall, cuz it does cut sooo nice..."
0," Worst $$$ spent ever!: I am an avid amazon customer and this is by far the worst thing I have ever purchased online..I cant belive how people can give this absolute piece of crap so many positive reviews,which tricked me into buying this..This has absolutely no fragrance at all,and I could detect it only if I smelled hard..I asked my husband to smell it and even he said he couldnt much..I dont think both of us has olfactory probs like some reviewer mentioned here..and for what its worth it doesnt even last 1 hour..by which I mean,after 1 hour when I smelled the area I rubbed it in,there was nothing! and yeah ,when you put it on and smell it, it smells cheap powdery!I am so dissapointed by this purchase not just because of the bucks I spent,but to think I made such a bum of myself by buying this cheap thing,with so many expectations..Pls do yourself a favor and stay away..!"
1," beauty, eh...: ...loud, distorted and derivative: That describes some of my favorite bands of all time! Let's face it people, it all overlaps. Trail mainly borrow from the Sonic Youth school of punk rock, territory that has already been mined plenty by the likes of Unwound. However, Trail of dead do it way better. In fact, they do it way better than Sonic Youth has since Daydream Nation. There are a few moments that sound almost too Teenage Riot, but it's still really well done, well played, and well produced. Other moments hint at uncharted future territories. If they ever truely find their own voice, Trail of Dead will be a force to reckon with. Mark my words on that, b/c as my brother once said, ""my brother's a genius, eh, he knows the atlas."""
0," DANGEROUS!!!!: I have owned my Rowenta commercial professional item for about a year and a half and we probably used it once to twice a week and stored it in a typical fashion. Last week as the iron was heating there was a loud pop as sparks and smoke started flying from the back of the iron (on the cord where it meets the iron). It blew the fuse in the house and left black soot everywhere. Luckily I was there to unplug it. I called Rowenta customer service and was told that he fault was mine, but as a one time thing they would replace the cord on the iron. Why would I want that iron back? I was very disappointed with customer service - I will never buy a Rowenta again!"
1," Solid Product: Great product, very substantial and sturdy. I used on 8' Doug Fir with zero issues. Not the cheapest but I plan on using it for many years to come."
1," Britain's 60's blonde-bombshell who packs a punch: Kathy has a terrific voice and fabulous good look, camparable with Marilyn Monroe. Anything by this artist is worth buying. She was Britain's highest paid femail artist in the 60's and hit after hit. Today she is in retirement sadly."
1," Super Duper DVD/ VCR: I have a nice system with large plasme and surround sound and with the HDMI outlet going straight into back of tv - the picture is flawless and the sound is great. I could tell it was a quality unit when I ordered it and then when it arrived a few days later and I saw first hand that was quality!!!! Still learning how to work the remote and all that it will do, but would recommend it to anyone."
0, Say What? Say Yeah: Utopia was at the top of thier game on this tour but the video and audio quality of this DVD is just awful. The bonus interviews are great and make the item worth picking up for nostalgia purposes only. Get Redux '92 if you want some great Utopia live stuff on DVD
1, For those who missed the first season: I rented this DVD because it featured episodes that were shown during the first season of this show. I am so glad that I rented it because many of the episodes I had not seen during that season. It was great to see the episodes that I missed and it also gave a deeper understanding to the characters on the show. I felt the episodes were each very funny and well-selected and gave each of the main characters enough of a showcase. I enjoyed this rental so much that I am now going to buy it to add to my collection. I am hoping there will be future releases in this series.
0, Bourne fans....don't waste your money: I saw this movie in the theaters and refuse to add it to my collection. This is the worst movie of the 4. The story appears to only be a bridge to launch the new character....and that bridge is poorly built.Suggestion...wait for the movie to show up on USA Network in a few months.
0," A waste of money: I purchased this to learn about Dachshunds, the sizes, coats, colors and temperaments. I didn't learn a thing. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1," Cheap protein and tastes good!: I mix my shakes with some of this as a base. I tried it on its own and I do like it better than past vanilla proteins (xRated, MesoTech) but for the price and size Im very happy. Ordered through Amazon prime and was picking protein out my teeth just 2 days later. Im very happy"

0," Brainy Baby - Animals: This did not seem like a Brainy Baby DVD. My 13mos old son loves Brainy Baby with the classical music and the cute babies, he loves to comment on the babies and point to teh screen. If you want a DVD with just shots of animals then this is proabably a good movie to get, there were lots of anuimals. But if you're looknig for a good Brainy Baby type DVD, I wouldn't suggest this one."
0," How hard is it to match numbers?: I went to the Kingston website, looked up the compatible memory for a Dell computer. Then I went to Google, did a search for lowest price on that part number. Trusted Amazon, so paid a few dollars more and bought from Amazon. When I went to install the 6 identical memory modules I had ordered, I found I had 5 memory modules with the correct part number and a 6th which was physically very different and a very different part number. This is very sad and disappointing that this type of an error could occur.The 5 modules worked flawlessly which is typical for Kingston, though I am still disappointed that the memory does have the low rent Made in China label on it."

There are a few specifics that I have yet to figure out, but on the whole, this unit is well worth the VERY low price. The choices for voices, graphics and visuals are detailed and complete.The maps so far have been accurate while the screen details during use are easily seen and followed."

1," Very easy to use: I have had this remote for a couple of weeks now. The remote is pretty easy to use and only took me a couple of minutes to get it working with my camera. It's great for family shots and easier than the camera timer for those.I'm not sure the buttons beyond the shutter will be useful because how would you be able to see how much you've zoomed in or out unless you go back behind the camera? Maybe as time goes on, I'll discover their value."
0, Not worth it!!!!: I bought this TV and after 5 months...the laser in the DVD player went out. Yes I was covered by the warranty BUT RCA doesnt make the part. So I had to special order the part and of course RCA still hasnt shipped it to my TV repair shop. So here it is November and I still dont have my TV! Dont buy this TV. The price keeps dropping b/c they are no longer carrying the parts!!

I have a new Windows XP setup and more often than not the phone will not respond when I have incoming skype calls. I frequently have to restart my computer to make a call. This is one of those first generation products that probably will get better. One hopes, at least, since it's a good idea."
1, a good change from disney princess fare: This book features letters to and from the disney princesses concerning their lives after they live happily ever after. It's a good way to add some dimension and humanity to the princesses that 4 year old girls like mine are so obsessed with. And having the cards and letters come out of envelopes in the book is really appealing.
1, Great earrings!: Beautiful earrings I gave as a gift. My friend loves them and I am happy I chose them as a gift. I recommend to all people who want to make a great gift!
1, Good read with my 6 year old: My 6-year-old enjoyed the cast and characters of Klikitat Street and all of the things that Henry gets involved in.
1," great camera: I took this camera to Hollywood, Ca and Florida and NY. I have great pics from everywhere and everyone! It worked for me! Downloading them to my computer was so easy. And than putting them on my digital photo frame completed my wonderful pic collection."
0," Very limited...: I couldn't find a lot of real information for buying and selling on e-bay with this book. The book seems to have more on common sense than on laws and regulations. I admit that I bought the book to learn more about buying and selling as a hobby and I find it more directed at first time buyers or buyers only interested in buying or selling once. He gives no references to state laws or regulations. I found that in order to make the book work I had to find majority of the important information online.This book is good for people that are looking for an overview of what to look for in cars on e-bay motors. It's an easy read with large print (much how the Dummies books are written). If you're looking for e-bay ""know how"" experience, it's not here, so if you are new to e-bay, you should buy a separate book.Overall, I think the book could have been better. It seemed to be a fill in the blanks kind of book when I was looking for answers."
1," A beautifully illustrated immigrant story: ""Oranges on Golden Mountain"" is an excellent children's book. The text by Elizabeth Partridge is complemented by Aki Sogabe's colorful illustrations.""Oranges"" tells the story of Jo Lee, a Chinese boy who emigrates to California, where he works as a fisherman with his uncle. He misses his mother, who is still in China, but he plants orange branches that she gave him to take on his journey.This is a realistic immigrant story with some fantastic/supernatural touches that evoke traditional Chinese beliefs. Illustrator Aki Sogabe creates many memorable scenes: a letter writer engaged in Chinese calligraphy, the Dragon King flying over a stormy ocean, Jo Lee tending his orange saplings, and more. To sum up: this is an excellent book for children of all cultures."
0," Yuk recipes - but great diet: I love the low carb diet plan, it has been working well for me so far. But when I got bored with my food I knew I needed some new ideas so I purchased several low carb cookbooks. This one is just awful to me - I haven't liked a single recipe yet. I keep thinking that a Dr. Atkins' cookbook would have to be great but I am so disappointed. If you want some new recipes ideas, may I suggest ""Lauri's Low Carb Cookbook"", it's the best I've seen to date."

Now, my Apple macbook gets a very low signal as well in my room, but, it is fairly reliable and keeps the connection most of the time. I should mention that I am using the Buffalo router WHR-G54S, which goes along with this adapter card. The range is lacking though in comparison to the Apple Airport."
0," Don't Buy This Splitter: Do not buy this splitter if you are trying to split a single HDMI source to 2 HDMI displays. It doesn't work, even though that is precisely what it is supposed to do. I tried connecting 2 Samsung TV's(LN37A550 & LN19A450) to a Motorola HD cable box(DCH3200) and it doesn't work. If you plug one display into the splitter that TV works, but when you try to plug-in both displays, neither works. I purchased two of these splitters and neither worked, so I doubt it was just a case of having been shipped a defective unit.This splitter is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. Amazon should be ashamed of offering this product on their web site and it should be removed immediately."
0," No sale: If you can't buy into the premise - or even just go along with it, after all, it's only a story - then you cannot really enjoy the ride. That sums up my feelings about this book.Some of the characters - particularly the President - were too clueless to be believed.The author does deserve credit for the extensive research on the tools of the CIA, FBI, and Navy SEALS. But there were too many characters and subplots to wade through too make for a good ending; too many loose ends to tie up.I like the genre, but can't recommend this one."
1," fun bathroom book: This is a fun book to put in the bathroom, and I mean that in a good way. It is witty and a bit insightful, and you can read it in short or long bits and find something to make you laugh. Isn't that what one needs in the loo? A few samples:Fashion -- Today's rage, tomorrow's chuckle.Math Anxiety -- An intense lifelong fear of two trains approaching each other at speeds of 60 and 80 mph.Science Fiction -- Fairy tales for nerds."
0, garbage-should be rated PG not X: Actually zero stars. Kinda like a video I once bought rated X that ended up a series of interviews with some ladies after a nice spicy description.
0," Lost: Great ideas, great characters, wonderful setting, excellentacting all leading to amazing disappointment at storyline.I have no problem losing a main character if, IF it is worthit. Losing a main character gratuitously feels like I'm beingcheated by the author. In this case the character you aremost invested in is so purblind as to be an outright idiotin the end. How he became the head of one of the sevenkingdoms is beyond the storytelling abilities presented here.Unless you are willing to suspend belief at the level of ananimated Disney movie, I would beware of starting this one."
0," Not much of a diaper bag: The toy is fine for a toddler. However, I thought I was buying a sturdy doll diaper bag for a 7-year-old. The bag is a very thin, small, flimsy thing with a few items to go in it. It was all much smaller and much flimsier than I thought it would be. Definitely not worth the price."
1," The Live Upclose & Personal Brilliance Of Donny Hathaway!!: To say that Donny Hathaway was one of the greatest vocal instruments thatR&B;/Soul has ever encountered would be both an understatement as well as redundant!To tell you that his musicianship, writing and arranging skills were off the chartswould get a resounding ""DUH!!"" from people who are in the know!This collection of LIVE performances, some culled from 1980's ""In Performance""and some which didn't make the cut on to Donny's stellar 1972 ""LIVE"" collection,further show and prove the brilliance of the tragic legend whose work,basically 3 studio albums, 3 live collections, and the immortal duet albums hedid with his musical soulmate, Roberta Flack, has inspired more modern urban R&B;/Popsingers and R&B;/Jazz/Gospel musicians' than one can ever imagine!This is a beautiful collection which you can still feel the intimacy, warmth, sincerity,and the effortless power that Donny Hathaway possessed in droves!--Plz Check It Out 4 Sure!

0," if you like feces, you'll love ""the happening"": and on the flipside, if you liked ""the happening"" you most probably love feces. this movie was a fecal mess belched out of the anus of everyones favorite armchair messiah, m night shyamalan. the people praising this movie as ""brilliant"" drank way too much of the kool aid."
1," 7Minds-Help Me Remember: 7 MindsRockHelps Me Remember7 Minds is a very explosive and funky band. Their sound is pleasing to the ears. The first track on the album, Heads Up, was a very good choice. It's an attention grabbing song. It says ""Hey, listen to me. I'll be worth your while,"" and it was. The album also ends on a good note. The CD finishes with the song Static. Static makes you want to hear more. This album deserves a 4 1/2 rating. I thouroghly enjoyed what I heard and look forward to hearing more from them, but this time on the radio."
0, Be fine if it worked: I'm sure they are great if it only worked ... I have tried everything .. acts like it loads but when you try to retrieve it later .. says: you must format : Tried that also.. No help there ..I guess I should have stayed with the name brands..Haven't heard a peep back from the seller..Duh on them ..
0, execrable: to be avoided at all costs - nightmarish - I had to give it 1 star as there is no option for no stars
1," Jennings is still great...: As the second book in the Aztec series, ""Aztec Autumn"" pales a little in comparison to the epic ""Aztec"". It is still very well researched, and it carries the story well in the early days of the Spanish conquest. It just isn't quite as engrossing as ""Aztec"". I still enjoyed Jennings's extremely well researched realism and the lead character in this book, Tenamaxtli, is still an interesting character. He just isn't Mixtli. That's probably the danger in creating a character as brilliant as Jennings did in the first book.I still recommend this book. I think it is much better read back to back with the first book in the series. Turning the last page of ""Aztec"" then opening the first page of ""Aztec Autumn"" is worth the price of the book."
1, Great Sound: Great size and sound! I bought these for my mom and then went back and bought two more for additional people. I think I will probably buy one for myself too once Christmas is over. You can go to their website to listen to the chimes.
1, non-gluten product: My wife and daughter suffer with celiac disease this is perfect product for people with this problem.
0," So much for the special edition.: I payed extra for the special edition copy of this movie, which came with the movie and a metal cover case. When I got the movie it was in a cream colored sealed envelope, when I opened the package the case was so crushed I couldn't even get the movie out to watch it. I guess the extra money I paid for the special edition version was to protect the dvd from getting broken, cause if it wouldn't have had the metal case the dvd would have definitely been broken when I got it."
1," Great quality music: I have been hearing so much about this band for the past 2 years.I finally decided to order it through amazon.I am not at all a death or black metal fan,coz either it's toomonotonous or just noise.But once I started playing this cd ,I was amazed at the quality of the muscianship of these guysand vocals of stanne.Then why only 4 stars you may ask.Well I wish stanne could use some variations in his vocals.just a minor complaint,SO GO BUY THIS CD.Check out fellowswedes opeth's new album ""ghost reveries"": great progressivedeath metal."
1," Lovely, relaxing, Christmas music.: I've had this CD for about ten years, and I can't recall where I found it. Regardless, I play it regularly throughout the Christmas season because it's one of the most lovely, relaxing, and unique Christmas CD's out of the seventy or so Christmas CD's that I own.Last night I had my annual Christmas party, and as the night was winding down I put this CD on while we all sat around the blazing fire enjoying one last drink. Everyone asked what CD is was, said how much they enjoyed it, and told me to send them the link so they could purchase the CD.I don't know anything about Chuck Lange, but his guitar renditions of holiday classics, mixed with the sounds of nature, has become a Christmas staple in my home."
1," Bookworm: This book is very moving. The way it was written, transports you back to Nazi Germany and shows what it was like to live during World War II. The relationship that forms between the girl and the Jew says that even is someone or something is repressed because of the beliefs of one person, it doesn't mean that you have to believe that too."
1," Some remakes do work: Yes there are some remakes that do work and the Coen Brother's True Grit is one of them. John Wayne may always be the definitive Rooster Cogburn to most people, but Jeff Bridges has turned in an Oscar nominated performance that does nothing but compliment and enhance the character. I am so glad that they followed the book more faithfully, rather than just simply remake the original film. The supporting cast is also excellent and in my opinion, with the except of Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper (in the 1969 film), even better than that of the original movie. Kim Darby was really too old to play the 14 year old Mattie Ross and Glen Campbell was never much of an actor. Matt Damon is a vast improvement as LeBeouf and certainly Josh Brolin proves a much more menacing Tom Chaney than Jeff Corey was. I can't wait for this DVD. I hope it is full of extras."
0," Huh?: I clearly missed something the other reviewers got. I consider myself fairly well-read and I'm always up for a challenge. However, this book lost me. It seemed to me like it tried to be/do/say too much--and kind of failed. The humor was dim, the plot jagged and depressing. One scene in particular was so horrible I had to put the book down--though I do have to give it to the author for being able to render such horror so intensely. Overall, it left me feeling hollow."
0," Flimsy and more of a Hassle than anything.: I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often. It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's ""spring locks"" to lock into place. It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it. And sometimes it's almost impossible to ""unlock"" it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it.Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price. You could find something much better for around the same cost."
1," Great CD, one of the Best I know of...: This is a Great CD, and I got it as a gift. Purchase it, and see what I mean. I like this sorta music, and it keep you feeling alive. It isn't boring, and I hope you'd enjoy it if you buy it. Blink 182 is a great punk band. I suggest you buy this CD and listen to their early songs."
1, Battle Cry: I read this a loooong time ago. Purchased as a gift to my marine son. Probably the greatest military novel ever written
1," Incredible: This has to be one of my favorite albums ever, and I'm not even a jazz or R and B fan. I listen to Punk Rock and Ska, but this album is right up there, in my opinion some of the best music ever made. I think that this tribute to Ray brings back the sound of his music remarkabley well. Everything is perfect, every track is one of my favorite Ray Charles songs. Among Ray charles, this album is a great way to start, and you should definately try to get it if you are a Ray Charles fan."
1," A true classic: Aimee Mann is easily the best female singer-songwriter in the US right now (see, for example, her recent work Bachelor n.2 or the soundtrack of Magnolia - her great ""breakthrough""). ""I am with Stupid"" only shows that Aimee's magic has been around for a while - since 95 to be precise (I, particularly, think that her first solo album ""Whatever"", 1993 - although very, very good - is a little tentative). Indeed, all the 13 tracks of the album are impecable - showing the maturity of Ms Mann's talent and her absolute control of her work - and 5 of them are, in my humble opinion, true gems of rock 'n roll (count with me: ""Long Shot"", ""You could make a killing"", ""Par for the Course"", ""You are with Stupid now"" and ""It's not safe"").This album is not for kids, folks. It is the real deal. It will take absolute control of both your heart and mind for a long, long time."
0," Trying to Install: Received this product earlier today and I've spent almost 4 hours trying to get the installation to work. I'm not a techie but usually have no problem with these things (hey, I can even program my VCR/DVD). If/when I can complete the installation I'll follow-up this review ... although at this point I'm not throwing the box away since I might use it to ship the product back and get something else."
1," TekWar series -- 2nd year: I loved this series when it first aired. I am holding off watching these episodes because they follow the 4 TekWar movies which preceded it. For some reason they are not yet available on DVD! I hope that Amazon will exert its influence to make them available soon. They are entitled TekWar, TekLords, TekLab, and Tek Justice"
1, Oh My God!: This CD is so good. I am not a traditional blues fan and this CD is an awful surprise and a great introduction into the blues genre. Way to go Sista!
1, Great price and great duvet.: When i recieved the duvet set I was very happy with the color and over all quality of this product. I was also excited about the price. I would definatly buy another.
1, Great Protection: I had the 1.5 kva version for use in my family room and added the 1.0 kva version for my bedroom. This is great for protecting your electronics from power fluctuations that happen all the time. It is especially great for power sags which can hurt electronics even more than surges.
0," Piece of junk.: THis guns fps is horrible, can hold baerly any BB's, and looks retarded. Mine broke withing a couple of weeks. I had my friend unload an entire clip on my back from 15 feet and it didnt hurt. Save up some cash and buy a good gun. This one is just sad...."
1," To anybody who is getting the blu-ray version: To anybody who is getting the blu-ray version, can you please let me know if it has english subtitles or closed caption? I am deaf, thanks!"
0," Defective product: The headset would not turn on even after charging as instructed. It would turn on when plugged into the wall while charging, but would just not turn on when I attempted to use it normally. Must be some defect in the power-up component. Had to return it."
1," COUSIN KEVIN IS DA BOMB!!!: Why doesn't anyone mention him? This DVD is worth the price just to see that scene!!! I love everything else too but I like to watch the Cousin Kevin scene over and over again. The movie version is WAYYYY better than the dull, slow version on the album!!! Same thing goes for many of the songs. All in all, this is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable musicals of all time!!!"
0," Does not work with non-SE Windows 98!: Despite the fact that the description says it works with Windows 98, I spent half a day messing with it, only to eventually be told by Netgear tech support that it does NOT work with Windows 98, only with Windows 98 Second Edition. It would be nice if the description or documentation had mentioned this so I didn't waste hours of my life fiddling with it."
0," Poor customer service: I bought a Sharp Aquos 37"" and experienced a problem in a storm that caused the system to freeze. No big deal I thought because most everything has a reboot sequence.Well, I was right but Sharp charged me $175 to do this because someone had to come to the house to do the magic button sequence.I thought at least spending this much on a Tv that even though it was out of the 12 month warranty since this is a software/firmware issue Sharp would waive the fee.Boy was I wrong.Beware of Sharp Warranty."
0," Dolce...Is that you?: I am an avid user of Dolce & Gabbana, Light Blue. It is my signature fragrance and for some reason the product I ordered here totally missed the mark! It did not wear like the usual product I wear (purchased from high end department stores) nor did it smell quite the same. It carried a much much lighter bouquet and it evaporated like pure alcohol into the skin. It had ZERO body to it.Mind you, even in it's ""knock off"" form, this is a great smelling product so people who don't intimately know the product may not be able to tell the difference but me, aah, I am a connoisseur!"
0," Good Movie/Bad Digital Copy: Good movie overall, to be honest there are very few Ryan Reynolds movies that I don't end up liking. My major problem with this movie was as a lot of other people have commented on, the Digital Copy. To download it I had to sign up for 2 seperate accounts (Flixster and Ultraviolet). After finally installing new applications for downloading I got the movie, only to find out it's incompatable with Windows Media Player...it must be played inside of the Flixster application. Just seems like one more way they are making it harder for me to watch movies when I'm traveling."
0," I love Furst but....: This is not a novel into which he has put much effort. I have read every book in Furst's admirable series about men and women caught up in the resistance movements of World War II and I have enjoyed every one until ""The Foreign Correspondent"". Books like ""The Polish Officer"" and ""Kingdom of Shadows"" are worthy of the highest praise but in this latest effort the plot is a recycled one; the action is thin; the use of recurrent characters has now reached joke proportions. Please, Mr Furst, either get back your interest in this series or move on to something that engages your considerable talents."
1," pack n play in jungle fun: It's a nice product for the price. It's sturdy, portable and looks nice too. It's easy to put together and fold up."
1, GREAT PRODUCT: The cuff links are really nice and arrived quickly. The selection is great so I will be buying more in the future.
1, Nice Case: Great price for a great case. These cases are of very high quality. Just as good as the ones that come with a new CD. I would not buy anything else.
1," Best DVD version out there: I'm not a big enough fan of classical music to really write a review that will do any justice, but...this DVD did not dissapoint. Especially the piano concerto. Very good, excellent recording, and camera shots caught about everything I wanted to see. Very talented orchestra and conductor, I have been to only a few concerts that were better than the one on this DVD. If you must stay at home instead of going to the concert hall, then buy this DVD to tide you over until the next concert."
1," THE BEST C++ REFERENCE I HAVE ENCOUNTERED: Fabulous book, great writing and organization, very helpful to students and teachers alike. The pragmatic use of interrelational variables is explained in such an exquisite, easy-to-comprehend manner. The formulaic modulations are presently comparable to infinite problematic discontinuities of modulaic perceptions. The quantum relations of semiotics disproportionately inflect the finite use of intercorrelated quarks. The influx of geometrical diatonal dispersement is clearly established in the first chapter and is carried through to the last sentence. It is a great contribution to the society of intellectual conquestors. Thanks to Kumarswamy and Tiuley, we have a fine piece of work!"
0," Wait for the movie: I guess if you are really in love with Chaka Khan, the book will be alright for you. I liked her music years ago, and realized I didn't know a lot about her, so I got the book. I was surprised that it was so boring. Get it from the library. It really wasn't worth buying and had no insight into the real chaka. Where were the facts that exist in other biographys?"
0," Slow, very slow: I know I'm the bah-humbug here, everyone else seemed to like it. Someone gave this book 5 stars even though it was slow to start. For me, it was so slow I put it down and couldn't pick it up again."
0," Amazon Subscription Price: The magazine is great - this price is not. I got an email from amazon that read: ""As someone who has recently bought a book on art, you might like to know you can now save up to 65% on art magazines at Amazon.com."" It implies a SPECIAL saving. In fact, this is HOW's regular subscription price."
1," Excellent for adventure cyclists: This is an indespensible tool for someone traveling on bike. I go out on short cycling tours every few months, and my packing space is limited in terms of volume and weights. And something always needs adjusting; small repairs also come up. So far, this tool is the best I owned in terms of versatility, and for $29 you can't go wrong either."
1, animal books: I received the book in a few days and it was everything that I expected it to be. I was very satisfied.
1," Curt Schilling in the Hot Seat: Curt Schilling is a GREAT PITCHER. It is nice to see that he is also such a giving person. I did not realize he donates money each game to the Lou Gehrig's Foundation. I would like to be a pitcher someday too, and follow in his footsteps.Clinton Miller age:8"
0, Confessiones of a Crazed Addict: This book was poorly wrtten and did not entertain at all. There are many other books on traders and trading that are much more exciting. Cramer seems to be very much full of himself here. More recent accounts have brought to light some nefarious activity by Cramer and his hedge fund. Send a copy to Elliot Spitzer.
0," Kinda weak: This is pretty much just a warm-up for Slum Village vol. 2. Overall pretty weak, other than maybe 3 hot tracks that are remastered on vol. 2. Mostly just short beat samples and live or poorly recorded tracks. Just stick with vol. 2 and pass this one by."
1," Hey Lloyd man!: I was just surfing and my dad told me look up your book. You're sales rank is 680,000! Congratulations! Bye!"
0, blah: Not worth my time or effort. Would not buy again. Somewhat difficult to use as well. No real pleasure obtained.
1," Wayside School books: These books were a huge hit with my 7 year old son. I read some of the books aloud with him and found myself laughing out loud! They're quirky and a bit irreverent at times, but I would recommend them for any child with a great sense of humor!"
1, This is a cool book!!: Please buy this book. This is a very fun and good to know how smart you are. I tested myself and I turned out to be 154 as my IQ. I didn't even know I was that smart. Please get this book it is COOL!!!!!
0," Terrible Waste of Time: This low budget zombie-esque film is a complete waste of time, I rented it thinking that it would at least have some frightening moments but what I got instead was a test in patience. The details concern a toxic agent released by some dumb witted morons in the army in a small town and soon everyone gets the disease. The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out. Each time the military is shown on the screen, Romero has some corny drum beating like we are too stupid to figure out that the army is there. Absolutely no suspense and an awful ending to boot...."
1," Sisterhood Novels: They are quick reading and amusing. Not deep, and a story line that you can guess all the way through. But still entertaining for a couple of reads. I wouldn't want to read the whole series. A good break if ones needs a rest from our legal system and politics."
0," Fine, if you believe everything the government tells you.: I found this book dated and misleading. I was especially concerned with the advice to drink plenty of fluoridated tap water. More evidence is available that shows fluoride is dangerous, especially to pregnant women and babies.And it may be safe to eat processed cheese, but I wanted a book centered around a diet that avoids processed foods. Disgusting.I found the information in other popular ""Expecting"" books to be more complete for preferences towards natural diets."
0," Save Your Money!..........: My 2 1/2 year old never misses a show, so I looked high and low for this toy. I finally found one 1200 miles from home. Got an extra suit case to toke it home. I couldn't wait to see the excitment in my sons eyes Christmas morning. Now all I see is a pile plastic sitting on the floor. He can't even play with it. As eveyone has said the slide doesen't stay on at all,(ready to throw that), and the foot just falls off. I hope this toy is recalled because it sucks. Disney you really owe the kids something for this Christmas's biggest disappointing toy."
0," The first 100 pages: I must admit I didn't make it through 100 pages. I had good intentions, made it through the first 40 or so, then promised that I would pick up again 'later.' It's now been a couple of weeks and I've made every excuse that I could think of, before realizing that it's not you -- it's me. So I must with reluctance (but relief) consign this book to the box in the basement marked ""goodwill."""
1," Will change your life for better or worse: It was new year's eve and I was in a punk bar in pittsburgh, PA when I first hear a song off this album on the jukebox. It was Dirt. I immediately got up and looked for who it was...the stooges. This is still my favorite and in my opinion the best stooges album. Gritty hard rock and roll that extracts every last cell of hippidom from your body. Dirt and Loose are the best. The vocals are amazing and the way the album flies off into chaos in LA Blues at the end is perfect. You've got noise, you've got punk, you've got the hardest rocknroll to date, you've got a sax, sleeze, drugs, pain, blood, murder. Your head will crash down around your ears."
0, I would have given it negative stars if I could: Sophie's World is a philosophy text book with a small unrelated and poorly written story thrown in between sections. A horrible book.
1, My Favorite Nickelback CD!: I have all of nickelbacks CD's And this one easily the best. I can listen to the hole CD and not skip a track. I have the CD since the day it came out and I'm still not sick of it. One of my favorite CD's ever. Go buy it you won't be dissappointed.
0," NO CD: When it arrived today, I looked inside the cd case to find there is no CD for this! I am highly disappointed with this"
0," Dan Brown's Romance Novel: If you enjoy reading romance novels, think it might be fun to read a thriller with a very current-sounding plot, and don't intend to try to understand the science, you will probably thoroughly enjoy Digital Fortress.If you are reading this book because you are interested in the subject matter, and especially if you already have some knowledge of the subject matter, you are likely to be disappointed by the character and plot issues mentioned in other reviews of this book."
1, Talented: Hilary Hahn plays Samurl Barbers and Edgar Meyers Voilin Concertos in this DVD. The Concertos are enjoyable and Miss Hahn plays them very well. Highly recommended.
0," Horrible: Please don't invest your time or money on this video. the movie was dragging from the beginning until the end. My roommate rented it for becasue he thought it would be hilarious for me because i am big ""godfather"" fan. Dangerfield has lost his touch since the ""caddie Shack"". i lost the interest of the movie half-way through it."
1," Great product: Motor arrived in 2 days and had instructions. I was amazed at how quickly the item got here. It worked as soon as I put it in. Probably saved 100's by replacing the motor. The old one was making a loud banging noise, this one is quiet."
1," Yep, exactly what the title says: This workbook is exactly what it says on the cover, practical application of math skills in real-life words problems. These aren't those silly ""How many pencils do you need for the second grade class?"" type of questions. These are REAL LIFE word problems like the ones students will face in the real world outside of school. If I could give this particular workbook 10 stars I would."
0," Indie folk-pop: Unfortunately, compared to Crowd, Barbarians sounds like a group of songs recorded quickly, before their possibilities were fully explored and exploited. The songwriting is still there, but the extra care and refinement that made Crowd so rewarding has been replaced by a more one-dimensional sound: changing electric guitars, fewer counter melodies, harmonies that teeter, and simpler, more staid rock arrangements."
0," Pick up a used copy: Don't believe the hype. This is a very basic thriller, containing information that's standard in an introductory college-level art history class. The ""puzzles"" are laughable at best, character development is nil, and the writing style is about ninth grade. Plenty of artistic license has been taken with history. If you enjoy formulaic stories, you'll like it; if you want more substance, you probably won't."
1, Maxell 634046 Rewritable DVD +R: Load into the DVD recorder quickly and without errors. Good quality recordings. Can re-record on them many times without errors. I will buy this item again.
1," Worth the travel in sight and sound !: Being an avid listener of Buddha-bar, I have been waiting for a DVD release for some time. During a trip to Medellin, Colombia, I saw it and took a chance. It was more then what I have anticipated and a reflection of a Patrick O'hearn dvd by David Fortney on a similiar travel thru our National Parks. The difference are the animals in their natural enviorment. It is worth more then you can imagine as well as the travel in sight and sound!"
0," Useless Strategy Guide !: This guide was a disapointment. It only gives generic information about the game. I was looking for tips on all of the car setups. Drivetrain, suspension, etc.. Nothing there. Even though the book (used) was cheap, it still was a waste of money."
1, Better Night of Sleep: My daughter is a light sleeper and this has helped her sleep without the distractions of household noise etc. We use it every night. Happy with the quality and the function.
1," Works great!: Works Great! Plug and play. It did come with a mini disc with drivers including ddr, but i have no need to try that out as i only use a regular ps2 controller. Highly recommended."
0," very disappointed: When the mascara arrived, the tube read ""for display only."" The mascara was old and clumpy. Not worth the price at all and very misleading."
0," Music for Sissy's: Justin Timberlake is a chickenhead doing a 3rd rate Michael Jackson impression!!!Folks, it doesn't get any worse than this!He is the future Corey Feldman."
1," Wonderful, very helpful, insightful book: I found this book after my husband passed in 2000. It helped much more than the support group I joined, my friend's and family's well-meaning suggestions/help. Helen Reichert Lambin hits the nail on the head with every paragraph. Something to keep and read over and over. I recommend it highly to any woman who has lost her husband. Everyone has their own way of coping & grieving and this book can definitely help. I plan to purchase it as a gift for a friend who, this week, lost her husbandin a hit and run accident."
0," Michael Kouri lies: beware of this man, MK-he has spread lies about me and i feel he is someone we should all be wary of!"
0, Poorly written - a very slow read: This textbook reads like a dictionary. I was looking forward to using it for a graduate level course but I am very disappointed.
0," Maybe this is a bit unfair, but...: ...this book is just plain lazy.Flaky characterization, sub-par dialogue, paragraph after paragraph of blatant exposition dump, dubious and overused single sentence paragraph emphasis...and really nothing in the way of emotional investment -- the keystone to good horror fiction.Maybe I'm being unfair, since I wasn't able to plod through any more than 110 pages before burying this thing. But man oh man...Ramsey Campbell, Thomas Lignotti, Richard Laymon, Clive Barker, Jack Ketchum, Poppy z. brite -- these are true masters of the genre. Maybe a bit harsh, but Bentley Little doesn't even register on the map..."
1," Help Me! Help Me! - outstanding and relevant: Eleanor Aspin's book Help Me! Help Me! is geared towards the preschool/kindergarten child. It presents situations that would require a child to dial 9-1-1. The beauty of this book is the genuine and elementary presentation of the situations that would make sense to a young child. It does a great job of not scaring children with the situations, but presents the information in an entertaining and understandable way. I would highly recommend this selection to all parents with young children. It could save their lives!"
1," Hidden copper affects many people!: This book brings light to a relatively unknown topic of health concern- high tissue copper. I learned what the dangers of copper toxicity are, as well as the symptoms. I also learned which foods are high in copper, and different ways to chelate copper out of your system. Everyone should know about the copper connection! Especially anyone with chronic fatigue syndrome or hormone imbalance!"
0," Item not as described: I purchased this item because the description stated the songs were by various artists. Normally items described as ""various artists"" are by the original artists. In this case all the songs were performed by one band that I had never heard of. I intended to use it on my DJ gigs but would not dare. I was very disappointed in it."
1," this is a good watch!: This is a very good watch, but the band breaks easily if you are not careful or if you take the watch off too fast, so you have to be very gentle with this watch. I got my band replaced at a jewelry repair store."
1," The Best Nozzle to Clean Anything: I have been using a power washer for years with the standard tips, but could never get the sidewalk, deck, and fencing to look good and not streak. Ordered this tip and just finished cleaning the sidewalk and what a difference it made. The water stream comes out in a circle motion and cuts the dirt like a hot knife through butter. I cleaned the sidewalk in half the time usually to do it and looks like new. Don't spend your money on the same old tips, spend a little more and get this one and you will be amazed."
1, Great teaching: The teaching in this book have been a great help to my family! Most every night for the past 3 years we have spoken verbal blessings over our children at bedtime. Our children have even occasionally asked to be able to bless us. I have even seen the blessings I have prayed over my wife come true. This has become a wonderful new part of our family's life.
1, enjoy: Loved this DVD from day one. All the characters are phenomenal. I have recommended this to many. Sequels not as good.
1," As advertised: This product does exactly what it's promoted to do, no more, no less. Given the price, the light weight and the small footprint, and that it works for the job for which I bought it, I'm happy with it. No problems with the handle and the snap-on ""comb"" is handy."
1," Above average movie: This was made for TNT in 1999. It never ceases to surprise me how good most of the cable movies are and this is no exception. Noah Wyle plays Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates. I don't know how much of this movie is true. It's based on a book. Still, it was entertaining and I'm guessing most of it is fact based.Jobs and Gates are two very different people in personality. Jobs seems more creative and Gates more logical. Both are power hungry and will get it by any means. Lots of subterfuge. But Jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her. I couldn't understand how he could be so cold toward them. Especially considering his own background. I don't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film.Anyway, I do recommend this. It doesn't matter if you know much about computers or not. It's about how they built their empires and them as people."
1," Good and interesting introduction to game theory: I really enjoyed this book. There were some areas where it was kind of confusing, but I found that overall it kept me interested. Their approach is good especially for those who want to learn about the topic and its applications but don't have much background in math or economics. Game theory is a really interesting field, and this text provides a good introduction for those who want to learn about it without getting bogged down in the math. The book does its best job I think in tying the principles to the real world."
0," Poor interviewing advice. Read ""Nail Your Law Job Interview"" instead.: This book is terribly outdated and offers very little advice on lawyer interviews. It seems to be written by someone who just sat down and wrote what they THOUGHT the hiring process should be. Its advice (for example, to sell yourself like an ""infomercial"") is simply silly. If you have landed a few interviews, you can't risk losing your shot by following poor interviewing advice. If you don't want to waste your time and money, I strongly recommend reading ""Nail Your Law Job Interview"" book instead - it is written specifically for lawyers (from students to senior lawyers), on how to succeed in legal interviews. It is much more thorough and offers a more accurate perspective on the interviewing process."
1, Good Movie: Thanks for sending the movie. I have already recommended it to friends. I have a lot of young friends that will want to watch this movie. so don't be surprised if you get more orders for it.While You Were Sleeping
1," A great multi-input monitor: A great monitor with multiple input formats, too bad it is no longer manufactured."
1," Great Net: The net was in great shape. The information when ordering suggested that i may need a ""center strap"" but didn't really say that one was included, so i also ordered one. When it arrived it had one with it and I ordered one so now i have two and actually when we installed it, we didn't even use the center strap."
0," Read to know some stories Indians write: One of the author's (Vatsala) letter says that she prays for the children of the hospital during her breaks. How noble. Read stories like this that Indians write to impress ""pherengis"" (foriegners)."
0," The Worst: I don't normally write reviews, but I just had to say, this book was absolutely the worst I've ever read. Is this supposed to be for adults? How can this be such a popular book by someone I thought was a well-respected author? I regret ever picking it up and wish I could get my money back on it. It really deserves less than one star. My advice to others: Don't waste your time!"
1," Outstanding: I have read this book and have given it to many of my male friends as well as their sons. It is a very good book to get someone who loves football and who hates to read, reading again. One young man I gave it to is a devoted Raider fan and he thanks me all the time for this gift. This is an enlighting book for a fan of any team. I read it myself and as a woman who grew up with and occasionally watch's football, I found it very informative. It is a book that NEEDED to be written. It is nice to know their are Doctors out their who can't be bought and have the integrity of Dr. Huizenga."
1," creepy: This book is about a sad, lonely, somewhat angry girl named Jessie who rescues an ugly abandoned cat, which sets off a strange chain of events she believes has its root in witchcraft. The cat, who she names Worm, does not look or behave like a normal cat. Pretty quickly after obtaining him, Jessie also starts to engage in unusual, not very nice, behavior. The book is very creepy. Although Jessie commits some morally questionable acts, you can't help but like her and feel sorry for her. An enjoyable read if you like books with a paranormal twist."
0," Poor Continuity: For those of you who read and are familiar with the Battletech Universe may want to think twice before getting this one. The plot is decent, but suffers from a lack of connection. It has little relevance to the overall Battletech picture. Characters are not well developed; and there is a type of ""sing-song"" quality to the pregression. It's predigested candy for a true Battletech reader."
0," christian centric not what I was looking for: this masquerades as a fiction book, but it's really a christian love book. not what I was looking for in a good read."
1," Well made and works well: We have owned a number of carpet sweepers over the years, some good, some not great. The Stanley (or Fuller) sweeper works great. With four black cats and a very hairy dog the living room rug needs touching up often. This sweeper is ideal for the job. I also like its construction. Other sweepers we have had had handle sections that were just pressed together. Any number of times I would have to take the handle off and bang it together to try and keep it from falling apart. With the Stanley sweeper each section of the handle is threaded so that once its together, it stays together. The price is high but at least I don't think that we will need to be buying another one for quite some time."
0," Very disapoyting: Those wore the worst flash picture i've done in 30 years.A 1969 ""Child Kodak Camera"" was better than that.The best camera I've had was a Nikon; It's a kind of people who knows their job!!!!But that ""S1 camera"" don't know how to work with its ""flash"".I'm sure that nobody told that camera it has a Flash!!!"
0," The dumbest movie I've seen in years.: Based on a true story? So what? I'm sure there are a LOT of ""true stories"" that similarly aren't worthy of being turned into a feature length film. If you want to watch a film full of dumb people being dumb - watch Jackass.After watching the first 10 minutes, I fast forwarded through the rest. What a waste of time."
1," E book: I put this on my tablet to read. I never read a real book, but enjoy ebooks, no clue as to why."
0, Wrong dimensions: The copy says this grill is 16 1/2 inches in diameter. Mine arrived today and it is 17 inches in diameter. Will not fit my grill. Also I ordered on Monday and the price was $10.99; today it is $9.99
0, Dumb: Confused this with another movie called American Beer; decided to watch it anyhow. Got through the first 20 minutes and fast forwarded the rest. I am now using the DVD as a coaster. Worst movie ever!
0," Stick to the video game.: After watching the animated movies for video games like Halo, Deadspace (Aftermath), and Resident Evil:Degeneration, I was hoping for another awesome Game-to-Movie translation but this one flopped.The movie actually starts out great but then starts to drag and some of the scenes could have loaded up on some more action and excitement. It all just becomes rather uninteresting after the first thirty minutes of the movie. Some really interesting and timeless issues are being touched upon and the story is so loaded that there is true epic potential. However, the presentation is so weak and un-involving that you just want the movie to end fifteen minutes earlier.Being a video gamer I was a little disappointed and hope for a reboot (or do-over) of this animated movie."
0," RPG-ing back in the 90s: Don't bother with this game. The games looks like it came strait from the 90s: only 800x600! To make things even worse: The story is very, very bad. There is no atmosphere whatsoever. And tehre are some nasty bugs in it too.So with great games like Morrowind, DungeonSiege, Arx Fatalis and Neverwinter Nights being released in the next two or three months, MMIX won't survive..."
0," blah for the bucks: ...after paying the shipping the item cost over $11.00That would be perfectly OK if the lemon-mayo gave a different little ZING! to things I would normally use mayo for. However, tastewise I didn't care for it, but I thought..oh that's just me. Then my DH said ""Ohh.h.h..h I dont even like the way it smells.""That's too bad, I love mayo and I love lemon, but this product didnt have an appeal to either of us.Finishing with something GOOD to say..it arrived speedily and I love the label..it's an attractive label."
1, Eternity Body Lotion by Calvin Klein: It was everythng it was supposed to be and much less expensive than what I have regularly purchased at Macy's. Love the smell and feel. I would call this a super value for a fraction of the reatail price at the cosmetic counter. I hesitated at first for fear it was not the real deal but it met all expectations and was delivered in a short time.
1," What a find!: 100 Flowers, possibly more well-known for having the same line-up as Urinals, has truly surprised me. This album deviates from the traditional fast punk of the Urinals and melds punk with garage rock. The result is fascinating: a vicious mix of the powerful and the fast, the rebellious and the energetic.The album leaves an extremely pleasant aftertaste, in the vein of Mudhoney's 'Superfuzz Bigmuff'. 100 Flowers takes the power of punk and the ferocity of garage and creates an incredible feel. My personal favorite track, ""Triage"", is a distinct example of this.Anyone who's reading this is obviously an avid punk fan, probably a fan of the Urinals. This album surpasses the Urinals by putting rediscovered energy and fun into the music, seperating them from the masses of underground punks who, frankly, are all the same. NOFX, The Briefs, Anti-Flag, Time Again. FINALLY, something to satiate the thirst of the bored punk rocker. Definitely recommended."
0," these are not 6"" filters!!: I was very disappointed that the size of these filters were described as being 6"" -- they absolutely are not! They are the same 12-cup 3-4"" tall filters that you can buy cheaper everywhere else. I really needed taller filters and bought these and feel quite misled."
0," Not enjoyable in the least: Bell is definitely a lawyer...not a novelist. His characters are stereotypical in every essence and not very well developed. I found myself disliking each of the characters more and more as they stumbled through their own journeys of typical and unimaginative self-discovery. The twist at the end of the book was not very believable nor was the storyline well developed. Overall, I would not recommend."
1," Medicine and Magic - A suffragist's cup of tea: I was a bit surprised by the negitive comments on Lackey's latest. Maya's character - a female physician treating London's ""ladies of the evening"" to make ends meet and still minister to the poor - is quite new. I thought the crew of animals was a bit overboard but I enjoyed all the other characters. I felt the bias and conflict within both the London magical and medical establishments was well portrayed and accurate - for a fantasy. The Sayers reference and the incidents of the deaths of suffragists due to forcefeeding strengthened the book. Development of the romance was a bit weak but otherwise a good effort. I would be interested in a sequel."
1," Defective Deshmective, it's all in your perspective.: As a Ride, Catherine Wheel, Stone Roses, Charlatans UK fan, I'm pissed I never stumbled across Chapterhouse. I have a vague recollection of Falling Down possibly having airplay on KROQ in Southern California, as well as vague recollection of the band name; until I heard Pearl and Breather on [...]. In fact the whole Shoegaze term was something I never heard of either. Showing my age & ignorance perhaps...but having no pre-conceptions of past CD content or recording qualities, I can't recommend this CD any more...a phenomenal listen! Each song has a different feel from the other, weaving through a variety of styles, as described in the jacket, allowing the listener to imagine being a fly on the wall at the moment of recording."
0," Freddy's back and you'll run screaming: Well, he doesn't belive it could be true. He moved into the house that belonged to dream therapist Nancy Thompson and is plagued by the same menacing nightmare man. This time, Freddy wants the young boy's body to accomplish mass mutilation via part 1. Not as good as the first (to be expected) and provides one or two good shocks the whole way. Hello, intensive care."
0," The author fails to deliver.: The back cover of ""Love in the Ancient World"" states that the author will tell the reader, ""What is love? And how did people deal with it from humanity's earliest days? How was it represented, communicated . . . ? The answer to such questions would be interesting.Unfortunately, the author confuses sex and love and tells us stories of Nero's slaughter of his wife, mistress, etc. There is pottery that shows Greeks engaged in gay activities. Do these things say anything about love? No. There is a difference between love and sex which the author fails to distinguish. He actually confuses the two throughout the book. The photographs are wonderful and I learned something by looking at them. The text, however, leaves way too much to be desired.(PS I am not some crazy conservative.)Do not spend your hard earned dollars on this book."
0," Is it Widescreen? Is it conpatable with USA dvd players?: A number of reviews of British productions seem to indicate that certain dvds purchased will not play in US dvd players, with no mention of that in the product description. Also, the same situation occurs when the product has been comverted to widescreen. The advertisements for the products need to address these two issues."
1," Ought to have: A blower is one of the tools an SLR owner ought to have.I actually prefer my BRUSH for the outside of the camera and the lens, because it takes up less space and works better (had one for years).But the blower can go places the brush can not (inside the camera).PS [camera manual says to use a blower]."
1," Well Made Item: Fits Toyota Rav4 well. Slight odor new reducing with age. It is a form fitted wheel cover of velour material. Each black rubber grip areas has about a hundred pimples creating a really nice feel. I wish I purchase two, guess it will have to wait for another free shipping purchase."
0," Not real happy: Product come on time, and was well packed no scratches or dents looked very nice. The real problem was putting them on.. Was not real easy, matter a fact it took me about 3 hours and still feel they are not on perfect.You have to take body mount bolts out then tap bushing away from bolt (so you just have bolt)That was not hard but.....it was attaching them that became the problem..After I had them attached and tightened bolts down ( I tightened them down good ) The GMC truck I have now makes all kinds a noise..(creaks and makes noise when making turns..It did not make NO noise before I put these on.I losened them up a little to maybe stop all the creaking but it still makes noise.I am NOT real happy with this purchase, would I recomend them? NO"
1," execellent book for any manager: Hello, I have read this book through at least three times and every time more truths stand out. I am a police officer and a pastor and this book has been invaulable to me. I read it through first, then I read it a second time using a high lighter to mark the interesting passages and then I read it again and was just as excited about managing and learning as I was the first time. This book teaches you to look at life as intersecting systems instead of isolated events and occurrences and fully explains why certain activities produce the outcomes that result from the choices that are made. I am a better police officer and a better pastor/teacher because of this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who manages anything."
1, Knowledge: Great History book that enlightens the love these people had -and have- for a Country that mistreated them.They exceled on their duty.
0," A disappointing introduction: This was my first introduction to the work of Alan Parsons. I am not really a prog enthusiast, but rather someone who quite likes classic Yes and who has been into electronic music for about 10-12 years. I founf this album fairly disappointing. Most of the album is derivative and lacklustre. I'm sure for APP fans who haven't listened to much electronic music this probably seems fresh and vibrant, but from someone approaching it from the other side, it is anything but. For someone who is interested in seeing how another progressive musician made the crossover to doing electronic music, I'd encourage you all to check out what Robert Fripp (formerly of King Crimson and others) has been doing with some of his side projects with Brian Eno and also the FFWD project with Alex Paterson of The Orb. Also recommended: System 7, with Steve Hillage's wonderful guitar work."
0," Looks like a bootleg DVD series, grainy picture quality, color poor: This is a very disappointing edition. The picture quality is grainy, and the color is poor. In fact, I am going to keep my VHS tapes, which are better, and hope a good quality DVD collection of this wonderful series is one day available."
1," EXCELLENT!: This is a great CD. And Christina started the blonde pop princess thing. Her song ""Reflection"" was released before ""baby one more time"", which, by the way, stinks."
0," Great at first: I reviewed lots of gates before I bought this one, and it seemed to be the highest quality for the price. I like the fact that it's made of wood which matches our baby's room decor (the gate is on her doorway, as the stairs are right outside), and the vertical slats are great as she's a climber. It was also very easy to install, now that the correct template is included. HOWEVER, the first time my daughter tried to rattle the gate around the bottom rail slid right out of the wall support, and with a little pulling on her part there was a lot of room between the last slat and the door frame. We've had to anchor the rail with a spring clamp -- very annoying. I can't find the receipt or I'd bring the thing back, and I'd never buy another one."
1," Great setting. Bad ending?: The first two acts of this book are exceptional, but I feel the final act is hampered by Rowling's lack of command of action. Just like the previous books in the series, Rowling is amazing when she's describing the unique environment and the wonderful characters at Hogwarts. In Half-Blood Prince she delves more into the character of Voldemort and his background.Unfortunately the book's inrecdible suspense must playout in the end, and I feel it is quite a disappointment. I never felt Rowling was very good in her action writing, but this ending just seemed like one long plot device to set up the next book."
0," Gizmo: Interesting concept, dies quickly, bought because I have little space in my kitchen, had an under the counter kind, and it was too close to toaster and coffee maker, and it melted, so I thought this would be perfect...not quite...maybe if/when Black and Decker comes up with a NEW & IMPROVED model with a stronger, longer lasting motor..."
1," Emotional Stir: One regular family can have such deep troubles with all the aspects of their ""Everyday"" life. Learned, or should I say, I was reminded how a family's health is the most important thing in the world and how precious moment each moment with your whole family is. A great, entertaining story as well."
1, Impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!: The last musical score that impressed me was Dr. Zhivago. Zimmer's score on this one leaves haunting strains which keep coming back-more from Thomas Moore's(Strummer really does great)piece done at the end of the movie.
1," Great ""quck read"" book: If you just have a few minutes to read here or there this is a great book. You can read through a few of these enjoyable, often hilarious urban legends. I have to confess that Mr. Craughwell has at least one in there that is fact rather than legend. ""The Hall of Tortured Souls"" about Excel 95 having a Doom look alike Easter Egg hidden within it. I remember reading that one 13 years or so ago and, since I was using Office 95 at the time, I checked it out. I saw that one with my own eyes so I know it is fact rather than Urban Legend. Most of these are so way out there though as to be hilarious. There are several great legends though that have just enough ring of truth to them to make you wonder."
1," Amazing!: Well, it's album #3 from the boys, and it is completely amazing!The upbeat tunes are very feel good & wonderful, and the ballads are beautiful and heartfelt. I have to say I was worried that the boys wouldn't be able to top their last two albums, but I think they did. The songs are very much uniquely blue (its a good thing!) and the album hasn't left my cd player since I bought it! Any true fan of good music and talent should agree that this album is amazing, and there's probably a song on it for everyone!"
1," Fit and Function are Great: I have not used anyone else's moisture trap and regulator, so I have no basis for comparison. I went from being connected directly to my no air tank compressor to this and it has performed as advertised. Easy to change and read air pressure and it has trapped some water."
0, No hard medical evidence: There is no hard medical evidence that bilberry has cured vision problemsor enhanced vision. Another snake oil salesman writing a book? If yousearch the internet you will find studies done by reputable medicalentities that confirm what I am saying.thdoctor
0," What it leaves out would be more interesting: Spencer Kimball's son and grandson set the gold standard for LDS biography with their candor. Sheri ""I have an obligation not to be objective"" Dew aimed for fool's gold. She not only left many things out, she also deliberately took other things out of context, all in the name of a favorable impression."
1, Great insight: Well-organized book with a useful albeit cursory look into the world of management consulting as a McKinsey veteran.Recommended for any one looking to learn more about the field but not for anyone looking for the key to the McKinsey thought process in detail.
0, Clever: A clever sequence of love story mingled with action to drive the budding romance. Good line of ever-present humor and plausible story lines.
1," Simon & Simon: Simon and Simon was a true family show. There was just enough drama and humor to keep everyone happy. I am amazed that Season Two isn't slated to be released.If your new to Simon & Simon enjoy the somewhat campy but overall good show. If your revisiting as we are. It is refreshing after so much ""in your face"" tv shows of today.Kenneth"
0, Poor quality and service: Had the unit for 1 year and then had a problem with the pump not working on the expresso maker. Sent the unit into NJ for repair paying $125 and they only cleaned the unit. After 3 uses the problem reappeared. Sent the unit back again with explicit instructions on problem. They returned the unit stating they could not find a problem. After talking with the RUDE manager. He stated if he could not find a problem he could not fix it. Would not recommend this product or the service.
1," Great introduction to a brilliant and tortured mind: This short, potent, megalomaniacal rant is probably the best introduction to the thinking of Freud's most brilliant and mercurial disciple.At 120 pages, copiously and vividly illustrated by William Steig, it can be read in a brief sitting.Though it was written after Reich's fateful turn down the dead-end hall of orgone research, it contains the most important insights of his earlier psychotherapeutic work, and is a compelling critique of the mass-psychology of life under mature capitalism.Those whose interest is piqued by this salvo would do well to investigate Reich's more measured and focused contributions such as his early writings in ""Character Analysis"" and ""Sex-Pol""."
1, One of my favorites: I recently read this book and loved it! What a great read. Mystery lovers should look at this book
0, I can't believe I spent money on this game.: Not nearly as good as the PC version. I suggest you just buy the PC version if you have a computer and if not rent the game first. Just make sure you play the game first and know what it is like before you buy it.
0," i wish i could rate this -478 stars: This diet gave me irritable bowel syndrome. If you start to have diarrhea, you may have to go on medication."
0," what me worry?: This book and I use the term loosely, is not much more than three low level menial UN employees trying to bamboozle readersinto thinking that they are important...which they are not....the book is boring as well as the sex and booze parties they describe...the pictures were not needed...once you see themyou can understand why this ""three-some"" needed ""emergency sex""it was the only kind they could get!!!to spend good money on a bad book is a crime...the UN's staff union cannot even give the book away as a party favor!!It reminds me of a book written by an old UN'r Chief Michael McCann....I believe the title was ""The UN...Has it's time come and Gone?"" Who cares about history written by GadFlies!And that's what these authors really are...Gad FLIES!"
0," Great design but fatal oversight in construction.: After less than a dozen uses, it broke and is now useless. If you look at the image of the product, you can see how the blades are housed in the black rotating frame. The problem is, the black frame is held in the red brace by tiny black plastic protrusions on both sides. Minimal pressure can make one of these snap clean off, as it did with me. Now it is worthless. Great idea, poor execution. Wait until they make a new version with metal protrusions."
0, Where's the peanuts????: This product should read Brittle with a couple of peanuts for looks. It also should be in a box to cut down on breakage. Very small pieces by the time it arrived in its plastic bag.
1," Killer game!!...Literally!: Okay, I bought this game and almost stopped myself from buying it. But when I brought it home and started playing it, it kicked butt, in both meanings! If you like Mario, great games, and a little violence, BUY THIS GAME! You can bicycle kick, shoot impossible goals, set-up your dreams plays, slide tackle from behind, and most importantly, HEAD-BUTT people! No rules and Mario all mixed into one small game package is the best idea Nintendo's ever made.Two thumbs way up isn't saying enough!!!! It's the awesomest!"
1, Dr Seuss Pops Up: Love that the book is interactive and the essence of Dr Seuss books. Very enjoyable read for young and old.
0," book is a waste of time: I bought Master Sudoku based on glowing reviews but found it worthless in improving my sudoku skills. Basically, the author teaches you to count 1 to 9 and then repeats the lesson over and over. She did not classify different methods of solving sudoku nor did she mention any techniques by name as other Sudoky books do. There are some good books that help you improve Sudoku skills but this is not one of them. I wasted my money and my time by purchasing this book."
1," Useful Bathroom Hook: This was my first purchase of this specific Command product, the Bathroom Hook. The hook(s) are working perfectly for hanging towels in my compact size bathroom."
0," Sunbeam heated mattress pad buzzes!: We are now on our third (3rd) queen size heated mattress pad (the first two were replaced under warrantee) and this is the first one where we have experienced this problem. I'm thinking that the wires extend too far up under the pillows as I can hear buzzing from the pad through the pillow when the heat is on and then it stops when the thermostat says it is warm enough. I lost about 1 1/2 hours of sleep last night due to this. Sunbeam says ""put a blanket over it""! That didn't work. I'm calling them again tomorrow and we'll see what the next 'fix' is!"
1," This book is ""must-read""!: This book will remain on my ""reading list"" for the rest of my life! Every single time I read it again; it makes me ask myself what I pursue, what am I after in this life? What am I directing my goals and energies at? What goals do I want to achieve and what occupies my mind... Success, financial power, career, esteem, fame, house, car, whatever feeds my ego? It feels like there is a written list in my hand, given/imposed by my family and the surrounding community telling me what I should do and what not, what is good, what is evil. This book made me realize that I am not living the life I choose; I am entirely blocked from the truth and a perfect role-player, acting in an apish manner. ""Universal Mysteries"" is one of the pinnacle books of Sufi Author ""Ahmed Hulusi"" that changed my personal perspective on life, on the meaning of human being. I highly recommend this book for spiritual seekers & thinkers of all faiths."
0," Very little Performance, very little detail: Don't expect to find many actual performance projects in this book. For instance, there is nothing on fuel or intake systems. The performance projects it does have are very limited in detail. The wheel alignment chapter basically tells you how awesome it is to have a performance wheel alignment, ""here are the specs you want, take them to your alignment shop"". The majority of the book is basic repairs that are covered better in other books such as my favorite ""MX-5 Miata Enthusiast's Workshop Manual"". But if you want to pretty up your car, the author goes into detail about how to install custom dash faces and how to put stripes on your car. Give me a break. This book is a disappointment."
1," Great but beginning to need update: This book is worth far more than is charged for it. Very well written. Probably the most-used reference book in my shop. However, it is beginning to need an update to keep up with most of the latest BIOS versions. Still a great value as the feature explainations trigger your thinking and allow you to figure out many related BIOS features in some of the newer versions. When Phil updates it again, I will buy it again."
0," Outstanding Program if you speak korean fluently: The Jewel in the Palace is a Korean drama based on the life of a young woman who became a Physician to the King, a remarkable feat for women of the era. It is beautifully acted, the costumes and filming is superb.Unfortunately this particular edition is let down by poor subtitles. In the 1-6 discs the subtitles are understandable with some concentration but in discs 7 - 9 the English subtitling is completely unintelligable. An example of this:""Is, say that is have problems inside the person who the food poisoning. Elephant words too not till the vegetableses that now ate have never type of matter"" (transcribed directly)If you speak Korean Fluently then this single DVD set is a bargain, costing substantially less than the three separate DVD sets of Jewel in the Palace which are available. However if you rely on English subtitles then this DVD set will not meet your expectations."
0," Pyle turntable: I ordered a Pyle PLTTB1 belt drive turntable on Amazon, and it didn't work at all.The motor was very loud and the tone arm would not move across the record.It would just stay in the outside grooves. A place to send the turntable was included,but I have no record whatsoever of the transaction. I have nothing to showwhere or when I bought it.I bought another turntable since then on Ebay, and it works great.So, now I'm stuck with the bad one."
0," Great Landscapes...uhmm, that's about it.: A couple of exquisite stories in the original bunch of ""Tales"" (""Mazirian the Magician"" is my favourite) lose their lustre in the subsequent ""novels"" -- actually a poor cobbling together of loosely linked incidents -- in the other three quarters of this collection. Vance has a colourful eye; his vision of an Earth at the end of time is wistful, poignant, strange, memorable. However, when he moves his brush away from composition to the banal mechanics of narrative and character development, Vance loses interest. EYES OF THE OVERWORLD and CUGEL'S SAGA, for example, are basically the same novel lumbered with the same obnoxious hero and EXACTLY the same (slim) premise.A better buy would be a slim volume the ""Tales""; the rest is just paper weight."
0," Worst digital camera EVER: This is the absolute biggest waste of money. Directions are written in broken English and make no sense. To give you a sample, ""If display screen says 'Hi resolution' this means camera is in low resolution mode."" Yeah. Sure. Totally logical. The worst part is that pictures just get erased from the camera without you doing anything to make that happen. Not good after my 5 year-old spent the day snapping shots of animals at our local zoo, only to have NONE saved. Just a bad product all around."
1," Yes, I AM Satisfied...: This is the 2nd book I've read by Cooper. The 1st was THE WAKE OF THE WIND. Cooper really knows how to tell a story. She wraps so many life lessons into her books. I think that's what I like most about her. I haven't read her short stories because I don't really like short stories. Each character in this book is given their own voice & Cooper fully develops each. Her writing is so good it's as though YOU yourself live in Yoville! I recommend this book for anyone, if you have teenage kids get it for them so they can see how every action has a consequence. Also for bookclubs. My bookclub is reading it now for the month of January."
1, SWEET band: This CD is amazing. Very fun...excellent for driving. :) I like them a lot...they're very unique.
1, Tough Knives: My husband and I were in the process of buying a home for the first time and needed a set of knives. I researched on what type and brand to invest in. I have had this set for five years and not once have I regret the purchase. They are just as tough and sharp as the first day I got them.My brother-in-law always makes a positive comment about these knives whenever he uses them. I love this specific branded tool so much that I bought one for him for Christmas!
0, Scattered tidbits of wisdom hidden amongst a contractors rantings: Don't bother with this one. The amount of knowledge in this apparently unedited blog of a book about actually building wells and septic systems can fit onto a handful of pages. The rest of the time the author goes back and forth between descriptions of wells and septic systems repeating himself but never going into much depth. He spends much of his time giving advice about how not to get screwed by the person you're building the well for. An example is not to promise anything to the customer since you can't tell if a well will contain water or not. Mhmmm. I would think twice before getting into any business deal with this contractor.
1," A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK: Dramatizing a quintessentially literary ghost story for film is not easy, in fact, it is pretty well doomed to partial failure for those who have grown up with the Henry James masterpiece in print and in several movies that have based themselves upon it.This is quite successful in showing Brittan's music to good effect. I found it interesting, entertaining, well-sung well-acted, well-directed; however, I found it much too prosaic and realistic to evoke the air of mystery, of the unknown and unknowable, that an effective ghost story should possess.I have not seen any of the other versions available on DVD, but would guess that the average viewer cannot go wrong watching this if his objective is seeing Benjamin Brittan's opera rather than Henry Jame'sstory."
1, Good price: I bought this for use in my sons psp and it works perfect. The price at amazon was really good.
0," Worst Game Ever: This game is the worst game that i have ever played. It has a wierd system of rewards that takes forever to get and is too complicated to understand. Other problems in this game is that it is too unrealistic, your opponents are always better than you and if you make any mistakes you lose. While it is technically possible to move forward in this game, it takes 30 plus minutes to beat any level. Fast progression is impossible in this game. So if you like frustration and losing a lot this is the game for you."
0," wrong item.: They shipped me CB-2LV not CB-2LX, I think a chimp that is mentally challenged could have read the label on the back of the charger and put it into the package. This is pathetic."
0," Don't order two from Amazon: They don't let you specify a frequency. I ordered two and they sent us two which use the same frequency. So my son and I can't fly them at the same time. I called customer service after receiving the order and they said they will send a replacement that uses a different frequency.I have to agree with other reviews, the heli is hard to control and even after adjusting the trim it can fly fine and then spin uncontrollably for no apparent reason. Still, my 8 year old has fun flying it around and it is still pretty fun and we are working on getting the hang of flying it."
1," Wonderful Book on Prayer: Dr. David Jeremiah's book PRAYER, THE GREAT ADVENTURE is an excellent book on developing a solid, biblical prayer life. The outlines that Dr. Jeremiah uses are well worth the price of this book. Each chapter examines various aspects of prayer from the basics of prayer to spiritual warfare to praying in the Spirit. The book covers nearly every aspect of prayer and as you would expect from a skilled teacher such as Dr. Jeremiah, he stays true to his text.I higly recommend this book on prayer. It will add to your prayer life and give you a rich understanding of what the Bible says about prayer."
0, Not Impressed: I was looking for a book with some great pictures and decorating ideas. It took me about 3 minutes to flip through this book and I didn't come away with any real solid ideas. Not worth the money.
0," A waste of money!!!: The wire coil is not strong enough to ""whisk"" anything but thin, high altitude AIR!!!"
1," A PRETTY GOOD WAR THRILLER...: This book is kind of unique since it essentially covers only the last day or so in Tokyo prior to the surrender by the Japanese government at the end of the Second World War. Reading about this one day makes it seem like one of the longest days in history since so much happens: the government trying to surrender; the emperor under seige by the army; junior officers in the army trying for a coup d'etat; officers getting murdered; officers committing suiside. Very much detail and a very clear description of what happened that day in Japan. Reading this book you get to know the characters involved and also their personalities. It's almost like reading a novel. A very powerful one, but a true story. I'd recommend this as MUST reading for students of the Japanese War. For the general reader it might be a little too detailed, but it's worth the reading."
0," Cheap ""Leather"": i opened this up and immediately packed it up for return. The ""leather"" on this strap is super cheap and thin. A very low quality product."
0," Sorry - But This is a Really Bad Urban Rebounder DVD!: Let me preface this review by saying that I purchased the Urban Rebounding ""Power Compilation Pack"" with my 48"" rebounder. I found that compilation to be quite good for the money. Now; onto my review:I borrowed this DVD from my library through an interlibrary loan. I'm certainly glad I didn't spend any good money on it! It consists of 4 pretty horrible programs. Rather than critique each workout individually I would suggest you save your $$ & try it out through an interlibrary loan (ask your librarian). The unattractive models are usually out of sync with each other and the music. The workouts are low energy, low cardio and uninspiring. You and I would have a lot more fun and burn a lot more calories by just free form bouncing to our favorite tunes.Unlike the Power Compilation Pack (and by implication, presumably, Compilation #1), there is no fun here; nor is there any good cardio. I was thoroughly unimpressed!Chris"
1," Cool!: Larry is a kid who has a band, and his friends call him ""Hairy Larry"". One day he finds a bottle of tanning lotion that is supposed to give the person who weres it a tan. The next day that not only does the lotion not work, but he also finds out that he is growing gross black hair! If you want to find out the rest, read it yourself."
0," Bad movie, but great for the Horror Movie collector: I am very fond of old horror movies, and gory stuff, but this movie wasent to good, only buy this if you are a big fan of horror movies. This video should be rated R, for the nudity(they dont tell you this on the box or on the site). When you first turn on the menu and click play movie, it's like a drive in, with lots of mid 20 year old women flashing people. As for the gore it's very cheap. Take my word, only buy this if your a collector!"
1," An enthralling book you will not be able to put down.: This is a wonderful read! You really care about the characters, and the historical details (1930-present) include the Japanese side of World War II. The plot centers upon a poor girl from a fishing village, and the fateful people and events which catapult her to become one of the most famous Geishas in Japan. It is a fascinating book, and I still think about the characters several weeks after reading it."
0," Was not as useful as it seemed to be.: This seemed like an awesome product for me when I first bought it. But, I didnt really use it much with my twins. My boys slept in the same crib for about 4 months. At that time I used it in between them assuming one would disturb the other. But, it never happened like that. Since at 4 months they were not still mobile and they really didnt get into each other's space. It seems like a great product but I didn't get much use from it. I paid $25 and it was not worth that much."
0," Don't enter the void: Honestly, I couldn't watch this. The Buddhist theme is what attracted me, but the raw, home-movie type video along with a muffled sound track that made hearing the dialog difficult was a huge turn off. In addition, during the 20 minutes or so that I suffered through, there was nothing there in terms of plot or character."
0," Cafe Del Mar contact Blank and Jones: I agree with Mr.""Graduate Student"" in that Cafe Del Mar has lost something with this latest CD. Where has the effort gone in this production? Sure it's relaxing, but it's just not entertaining. Blank and Jones have taken over the trend with their new Relax II CD. Check it out. It may fill the void while CDM gets it together."

1," Just like L F Smith said: This press has worked like a charm for my projects. I didn't even secure it to my table top, mainly due to the fact that I was using a 15 lbs drill vise. It's not flimsy at all as to what others have claimed it to be. Make sure the locking nuts and levers are secured and there won't be any issues with light pressure and patience. I was able to drill through aluminum, plastic, and steel (steel took a while) with no problems at all. Yeah it took a little longer than a regular drill press, but I don't have the space OR the money for one.The instruction manual was worthless, but luckily assembling the press was intuitive. However, the manual would be good for ordering replacement parts if needed. There is a nice break down of the parts that are included in the kit. Before ordering, make sure it is compatible with your unit, it is clearly stated what models the press is compatible with.This was an excellent purchase for $40!!"
1," Gentle warrior: A dashing hero who need not come to the rescue of the equally strong heroine. An amazing read that will have you moving the pages. Julie Garwood spins a tale of betrayal, passion, romance and intrigue all woven together in this wonderful read!!!!"
0," OK for 6 months, then, caput-: After adjusting for how pink this printer printed photos (had to take the Magenta setting to -15), it was OK for about 6 months. Now, every photo prints incredibly pink. I take photographs of art for a major collection here in Boston. Color matching is very important in my prints. This printer is horrible. By by. Im going to HP.R-"
1," Audio Book Review for Ms. O: The story deals with moving, cultural differences and basketball. The main charactar is Lincoln Mendoza or as what his friends say, Linc. He moves from the bario to a white suburb because a burglertook a tv. He used to play basketball for his oldschool(Columbus) and now plays for his new school(Franklin)and they have to play each other. He is becomes stressed out because he is playing against his old school and some of his old friends. As the game nears he gets into an arguement with one of his friends. On the night of the game he plays and loses. He doesn't mind because he made up with his friend that he argued with. I liked this book because the characters speak their native language, Spanish. It kept the feeling of a Hispanic-American community authentic."
1," Another Chet Baker?: Maija's rich, sultry voice ignites the songs in this CD. The variety is incredible. Old jazz favorites like Cornet Man and Devil May Care with a touch of Brazilian. This singer sings from her soul. A great addition to any CD collection."
0," time doesn't help a bad flick to be hip: this is minus 10 in ""z"" zone with this very poor and dull blaxploitation film . Everything looks cheap , from acting to action parts. Screenplay could have been interesting but stays in the around the main subject without getting really into it . Time doesn't need to be wasted by spending 90 minutes to watch this..."
1," Rocketman: Thought I was buying a DVD, but that isn't the sellers fault. The VHS movie was great and the quality was a new. This is an honest seller."
1, Crocodile Dundee II: This is my favorite of the 3 Crocodile Dundee movies! Lots of action and adventure with a twist at the end--fun!
0," No print sharing in windows.: It's funny, I'd always understood printer sharing to be a nowmal window feature. As long as both computers have the proper driver for a printer, one can share a printer to the other. This is not the case for this printer.After spending a couple of weeks getting it working, I sent a note to Canon's tech support. Their response?""Unfortunately, this printer was not designed to be shared across a network.""We have three different computers around the house, used by three different people. This printer isn't exactly portable, so just hauling it around to whatever computer needs it is just unreasonable.I am very disapointed that this very basic functionality has been omitted."
0," Good Luck: To all ye who purchase this piece of garbage, Good luck:- figuring out how to remove the ""top"" from the ""base."" (The directions are useless.)- inserting the battery (the too-short cord provided results in only being able to install/insert the battery plug into the motor one way - one painfully ineffective and frustrating way).- opening and closing the ice ""packs"" to fill them with water (which are just very cheap plastic inserts). The caps are nearly impossible to remove, and warp after one fill since you'll be needing a fork to pry them off.- getting it to ""advance"" (my advance button was broken).- trusting it to work (I tried it on all three settings - it didn't work).I advise you of this as a grown man with a college degree (he said with a snark). I patiently read the ""directions"" and even had a friend attempt to set it up as well. It is defective - and yet even if we could get it to work, I feel that the junky plastic parts are not worth your money."
0," This product deserves 0 stars!: It's unfortunate that I didn't research this product first, it is worthless junk. After some extremely lightweight shredding the thing is completely useless, unless you consider the wastebasket. I had the same problem everyone else had. Save yourself time and money buy a different(higher quality) product!"
1, D-D-D-Did you see the frightened ones?: Very good concert recording! The sonic effects are excellent. Very faithful to the original release. Roll a few J's and expand your mind to this!

0, Worst Sippy Cup Ever: In the effort to show our 23 month old daughter how to use a straw we figured this sippy cup would be great. We purchased it yesterday and she absolutely loved it! She enjoyed using the flip top for the straw and thoroughly enjoyed using it...until...she dropped it by accident and the bottom shattered into a gaping hole. We had the cup less than 24 hours and it was completely destroyed. THESE CUPS ARE NOT DURABLE AT ALL!!!

1, A great story and very well told - a classic.: This is one of the first 'good' SciFi books I came across as a teenager. The quality of the story-telling and the 'mood' created by the characters and the setting were quite memorable. I love this type of story-line but have never been able to find another book that really comes close. I will be dusting off my old copy and reading it very soon.
1," Good even for beginners: I haven't excersized much, but I've always wanted to dance since I was little. So far I've really enjoyed this video. It takes a bit of practice to get all the moves down. But it's not Too strenuous."
1," Must rad: The best monster book I have ever read. Very graphic, do not read if you have a weak stomach. An amazing story with complex characters making it hard to put down the book. The fact that this could actually be possible makes it even scarier. If you are into monster books you MUST buy this."
1," Breathtaking...: I was asked to compare this band with some other bands, but it was impossible for me to do such a thing. Love spirals downwards is just so unique and it is the only band I liked this much since I fell for Dead Can Dance many years ago. I recommend it to all fans of beutiful female vocals."
1, Completing the knife set.: We bought these kitchen scissors to complete the OXO knife set. These scissors are good qaulity and well packaged.
1, Faith of my Fathers: The continuing story of Hezekiah and when he was King. Lynn Austin has a way of bringing the story of Hezekiah from the Bible to make you feel like you walked along side of those that lived then. Wonderful series of books.
1," Perfectly Met Our Needs...: I purchased this cooler specifically for a trip that I was going on. I liked this cooler in particular because (1) the price - much lower than other coolers I had seen in retail stores and (2) the size - I was just going on a roadtrip and I only needed to store some waters and beers. This cooler perfectly fit behind the front seat on the floor in my corolla. It also stores 22 oz beers standing up. There are two issues that I would note for this cooler - (1) you have to be careful when closing it to make sure the lid seals and (2) my ice melted in it after one day - this was fine for me because I only needed it for one day, but if you are going on a longer trip, then maybe a more expensive cooler would do the trick. If it is a short trip like me, then this is perfect!"
0," AFI's worst...don't bother: I don't know why people seem to think that this is AFI's 'hardest' or 'heaviest' album...it's not. There is considerable throat-damaging vocals by Davey Havok....but it really lacks the menace and emotion of latter work. In fact, most of the songs are little more than teenage tantrums. The production is shoddy, the vocals are whiny and it's not even as fast as the punkier tracks on Art of Drowning or Black Sails."

1," Great read: I am really enjoying reading this book and just cannot understand how an adult can treat an innocent boy the way he was treated - I couldn't help but cry for him - I would have wanted to kill that man. It is easy to read (I just stayed up until 1 am last night - I could not put it down), but there are some typos, so if you can stand that, it's great."
0," Refirbished: I am so glad I got this when it was available new. I wouldn't pay 10 cents for this recycled cable that has been God knows where.

Your experience may be different. I did wind up in physical therapy, because the IT band pain became too great, so my condition may have been too severe for this to work for me."
1," A book for all ages: These books are trouble...only because they are addictive. I have read all three myself and to my four children ages 6-9. They are so excited about the series they can hardly wait for the next to be released. A quick read, charming and fanciful stories."

0, DANGEROUS!: My son has fallen several times while sitting in this chair. The seat on the chair will fall out of the base even when he is sitting still and buckled in. The side mounting tabs for the seat are very small and do not engage the side of the base well. The rear tab also does not fully engage into the base. I have contacted the manufacturer several times and they insist that there are no problems with the seat. The manufacturer wants to use my son as an experiment to solve their design problems. Do not purchase this seat!
1," Excellent book!: This is a book about self motivation from a person of multiple professions. In the book he guides you through his journey of self fulfillment. The book is well structured can give anyone motivation to find their true self. I would personally recommend this book to any one of my friends; however, this book is not for all people. People who hold strong to their ideas and are unwilling to listen to anything else (Ex. extremely religious people) probably would not enjoy this book. Like anything else, it is good to not be closed minded before starting to read this book. It is not selling any specific idea, it's more of an awakening to appreciate the moments we live through."

0, Periplus India Travel map: the actual map of the country ( big picture ) is about half of the unfolded paper. Of that half showing the country about 70% is other countries and water. The rest is street maps of a few cities.It is a very poor map of India in my opinion-not enough important locations listed- buy another brand.
0, Too hot: This product should contain live bacteria. It was shipped from Florida to Arizona and arrived so hot that you could barely touch the bottle. I have used it before and it did NOT work as it should. I believe all the bacteria were killed in the heat. I wrote to the producer and explained and the reply said that it should be fine. I will not buy from this producer again.

1," THIS IS A MUST BUY GAME!: okay, let me sum this up, this is one of the most interactive, amusing, colorful, amazing, interesting games in the universe. with a cast of over 40 playable characters, 3 different endings, incredible story and cinemas, wonderfullycomposed music, and huge replayability, what could go wrong? i just bought the game today and i was shocked at how smooth the graphics are. i know that in other square games, the graphics are kinda texture heavy and grainy (ffviii), this one is surprisingly smooth. 2000 is the year for square: ffix, chrono cross, threads of fate, vagrant story, legend of mana (coughcoughunplayablecoughcough), the BOUNCER, and front mission 3. wow"
0," INAPPROPRIATE FOR TODDLERS: I have a toddler (age 3) who *loves* Mickey Mouse, and bought Mickey's Christmas Carol based on (a) the excellent reviews it received and (b) an Internet search of the best Christmas movies for young children. We were excited to watch it!Unfortunately, this movie is one that I'll be storing away and possibly trying again in a few more years. Mickey's Christmas Carol freaked my daughter out, specifically because of Pete's character (the Ghost of Christmas Past). He's cloaked and actually quite menacing and frightful. In one scene he stands over Scrooge laughing, his eyes reflecting flames while Scrooge dangles, screaming, over a fiery grave. And then he watches as Scrooge falls in. It was all just a dream, but not something a toddler can process and differentiate well.I'm so disappointed that this movie is not more toddler-friendly!"
0, This product is HORRIBLE: There were electrical feedback and static noted during recording despite making multiple corrections in the gain and other attempts at corrections. Will not even record 15 min. without static problems. At first I thought it might be my record. I cleaned and then spent 5 hours attempting to record one side. Tracks that didn't have problems at first had them when recording the second or third time. It seemed so simple at first. I wish I could give this one ZERO stars. I returned it and am now looking for something better.I can't believe that my experience was so bad and others can rave about this piece of poop! I really want to warn everyone about this product.
1," Very good: A bit heavy but worth every ounce.Got it as a multi tool for my bike. Used it a few times, seems very durable to stand the hands of time. No buyers remorse here.Has an S30V blade.... If you know your steel, you know this is a great blade."
1," Brillance in POp?: A pop album thats speaks about sociatal hang ups? Only madonna is capable of such a feat. On the title track and ""The Act of Contrision"" she explores the drama of religon. And on the most powerfully lyrical pop song ever ""Till Death Do Us Part"" in which you can dance to the tale of domestic violence... Brillant definetly...Conventional... Never!!!"
1," Handy, or better yet heady flashlight.: If you want your hands to be free, use your head. When I crawl under a desk to connect a computer, now I can see what I am doing and use the glowing screen on my cell phone to make calls and not cast a blue haze on the cables. Works well when I am in the wiring closet (by myself) now I have light were I need it and two hands free."

0," Narrator Navel Gazing: Dreadful. This series of DVDs are by and large well done. I was quite interested in the subject matter, but in the first fifteen minutes, after listening to the narrator drone on about himself, he then 'rewinds' the tape - to show us how it 'could have' gone. I turned it off after I picked my jaw up off the floor! Dreadful. Could have done better, IMO."
0, Difficult to follow: Please save your time and do not watch this movie! The director uses the same images over and over again without any specific plot. It is an artistic movie to some degree... The director is trying too hard and does not succeed in captivating any sort of audience.
0, Waste of money: The guitar you see in the picture is not the guitar you recieve.Before buying this product I advise you read all of the reviews because they alot say the same thing. So what is going to make your order different.
1, Great item: Secures my sliding door perfectly and feel secure in my house at this time. Very easy to install and fully adjustable to any sliding door.
1," great story: This is my first book by Vince Flynn and I am quite impressed. It is a quick paced novel full of action and excitement. It deals with a topic of great importance to all Americans and the scenario is certianly scary and quite plausible. There are many interesting characters, some more well developed than others but an ample sampling of good guys and bad guys. This one is hard to put down. I highly recommend it."
1," Loved this!: This is one of the most fascinating and gripping novels of it's type that I've read in awhile, and a great exploration of what ""dying"" means without falling into New Age hokum. Plus, I'll admit I didn't see the book's surprises coming. Great characters, great plot and a damn great book."
1," Good show, but not their best tour: I wish someone could have filmed a performance from the Remain in Light tour, which was much stronger than the Stop Making Sense tour. The latter does lend itself well to filmed performance, and this is a great film nonetheless. I saw both tours, and the energy and songs on the Remain in Light tour were far better."
0," Disappointed: I wanted to be really pleased with this item, because I'm really tired of dealing with wired headsets - those wires really get in my way. The iLuv i202 worked great if I was sitting still, at my desk for example. But when I get up to move around - gardening for example - it would cut out for a few moments until I would move the transmitter.It comes with its own Bluetooth transmitter, which exhibited the above problem behavior. I also tried it with a Jabra music adaptor, a compatible stereo Bluetooth transmitter, and got the same results. Accordingly I would like to think the problem is with the headset, and not with the transmitters.Thankfully Amazon has its liberal return policy, so I returned this item today and am ording something else (the Sony DR BT30QS)."

1," Engaging - Well worth your time: I was daunted at first by the shear length of the book, but quickly became engrossed with the story. Ms. Kostovo knows how to pull you in... Most of the book is told through letters written by a diplomat to his daughter, explaining their family's strange history. In it, the reader also enters the worlds of Istanbul/Constantinople, Budapest, Bulgaria, Wallachia and Transylvania (Romania today) -- areas at war with the Ottoman Empire during the reign of the real Dracula, Vlad the Impaler. With this history, the author mixes in clever clues based on iconic church images that direct the diplomat and his daughter in their search for the tomb of this tyrant. Unlike many novels that successfully weave a tale of suspense only to disappoint the reader with a unsatisfying conclusion (Da Vinci Code, for example), the ending of this story is worth the time it takes to get there. If you don't like history, you won't like this book. If you do, you'll love it."
1," Zero to Hero: Very interesting reading, especially if you've ever attended a Pat Parellisavvy clinic, or are familiar with his work. He basically trains people inhorsemanship as opposed to training horses. The book describes in interesting fashion how he got to where he is today. More informativethan educational. Would recommend if you're already a Parelli fan."
0," over-simplified diatribe: Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
0," 21 Pounds in 21 days: The information was incomplete and not consistent with the program as described on Oprah (I think, some talk show). It took my digestive system 6 months to get back to normal functioning even following their instructions. When contacted for information they simply referred me to my physician rather than providing information that would have been helpful. I'm not happy at all with the program but I've learned to LOVE juice."
0," Bummer: My HP48 from 1990 just died and I bought the 50g thinking 20 years of upgrade must be in it. Not the case. The biggest bummer is the enter key is moved to the lower right corner and made small which makes this a one handed calculator. The previous 48 layout I could input calculations as fast as I could think, with two hands. This is slow and cumbersome ergonomics, I guess for doing slow and cumbersome calculations."
0," Not for my '91: Regarding the Chilton's 90-93 Corolla manual, I'd give it two-and-a-half stars if I could. It's better than no manual at all. I acquired a super low-mileage '91; I don't know much about Corollas, but I know these maintenance schedules and other bits of information pertain to older models than my car, and probably older than a '90 as well. If I hadn't used the glovebox manual as a guide, my car would have gotten a lot of unnecessary maintenance, and witnessed a lot of headscratching.I bought my book some time ago. This one has a different cover and might have addressed the above problems, but I wouldn't bet on it."
0," Yeah, it's ok if you like unoriginal Limp Bizkit/RATM clones: It's not that great. It puts me to sleep and they are tons more better bands out there that can A. Write good songs and B. play their instruments. The whole CD is very scattered too and it lacks a flow. They really should define their style before coming out with another CD. One point it takes on a Our Lady Peace sound, and then the next it's a direct rip off of Limp Bizkit."
1, Surprising result!: I know it's just a simple piece of plastic carpet -- so I didn't expect it to work as impressively as it did. But I must say it reduced the amount of tracking significantly -- which is all one could hope for.Other than the expensive cartridge problem (which we've solved with a Forever litter tray) the tracking was the only minor issue with the Scoop Free system -- which this item solved. Highly recommended.
1," Excellent quality!: This poster is both excellent quality as well as extremely beautiful! I wasn't sure what to expect since it was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised. I teach logic at a classical, Christian school, so it looks both stunning and appropriate on my wall. It also came within two days, which was much quicker than I had originally anticipated!"
1," Great rendering of Wagners Ring: It took me a while to get used to the new staging but by the end of ""Das Rheingold"" I just loved it. The performances are all at least very good with Eric Owens as Alberich and Debra Voigt as Brunhilde being particular standouts."
1," The Stranger Beside Me: A well-written, from the heart book with a perspective only the author could have. The addendums, written years after the first publication, provide good additional information and insight."
1, Cool Movie: This is the first anime movie ive ever watched and it was cool. i'm 13 and the only reason i rented this movie is because one of my cousins said it was good so i gave it a rent and i liked it. This is not the best movie ever made though! It's pretty gory actually I was surprised i have been able to watch pg-13 movies since i was like 7 and R since i was 10 so i wasn't like shocked or anything but for a cartoon it was quite violent. The thing i liked best about the movie was the fact that there was no clear villian i mean yeah that one lady whatever but not really i mean she had her reasons. Rent the movie i bet u will like it regardless of your age.
1," A must read for students and parents: A well organised book that uses simple straightforward prose to put forth an effective strategy for learning. It includes useful information for organising notes, completing assignments and preparing for exams. One of the better books on strategies for learning."
1," My most favorite show ever.... One Tree Hill: I gave it 4 stars because No matter how many times I try it, I can't get episode 7 to work right. For this rest of it I'm very happy about this purchase."
1," Addictive: I have had this mouse for a year now, and I am quite addicted to the forward and back buttons. I love the design...it fits perfectly in my hand and the two extra buttons are in exactly the right places.It is inconvenient to recharge the thing, but all cordless electronic devices have to be recharged, so I just deal with it."
1," Red Clover Tea: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms. I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not. I have purchased other teas of this brand. I would recommend their teas. I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion. It's a little bitter but bearable. Add some sugar and you're good to go."
0," For those without a clue.: Very disappointing. The Harvard name and logo can be so deceiving. The first half of the book is spent endorsing the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club, it's members and the author. The actual content is rather lame. If you are absolutely new to the world of business, and you need the definition of CUSTOMER explained to you, maybe you'll learn a little from this book. There are so many good Business Start-Up books available. My advice is to give this one a miss."
0," Not easily foldable: I've bought this tub thinking that I can just fold it up and store it under the sink. But that's not how it works. It take many steps to fold and unfold it, one of them ivolves inflating the seat! The mechanism for snapping it in place when it's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times. Also, the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things, probably not very pleasant for a little baby. I am returning this item."
0," Product a failure: This product looks great but failed to perform its primary function-to contain our animal. The zipper on the front flap does not stand up to the pressure applied by a determined amnimal. My dog is a 24 lb. terrier. For me, thrown out money!"
0," not worth the cash: I was really wanting to watch this and within the first 5 min i could see that it was on a downward spiral, the effects are subpar and the story is loose at best. I'm guessing they plan on another show by the way this ended but I couldn't say i would go watch it, or even rent it due to how bad this one was. Not giving details just in case you do rent it, but i will say this it is very disapointing."
1," Dialogue: Fr Lev has written several volumes as a monk of the Eastern Church. Some deserve reissue and rereading, none more than this small set of 46 meditations. Roger of Taize wrote that one does not understand everything in the Christian Gospels but should act on what one does grasp. Fr Lev has encountered Jesus in the Gospels and here shares his dialogue with the Saviour as one who has grasped more than most."
0," Twice the Wrong Parts: Twice the wrong parts were in the box. Needed them for a Ford F250 Superduty Supercrew and they were for a regular cab. The first order wasn't even close. It seems someone is just shoving any type parts in the wrong boxes... I would have liked a confirmation that I was ordering the right item for my vehicle. Yes, I did check the drop down for my vehicle...."
0," WHAT A JOKE! Ya get what ya pay for. In this case; CHEAP: Purchased two ""STICK UP BULDS"" for $13.88 shipped. If it didn't cost so much to send back, they would be ""otta-here""...WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT! Hoped they would light up a dark closet, BUT a candle would do a better job!......DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOLKS. TRUST ME!"
1," A Classic Western with the Duke and Clift: ""Red River"" is an epic western that features John Wayne and Montgomery Clift at their best. It's sort of a ""Mutiny on the Trail"" with the Duke in one of his darkest, most fully rounded portrayals. A great film that deserves a full restoration for DVD."
0, LATE..OUTDATED..6 MONTHS LATE: STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE.
1," Computers that need underwear?: An odd ride from Clamp. Enjoyable but odd. Chobits is another great Clamp comic. Chobits offers a sci-fi tale of the future when computers have taken on the shape of humans. This comic gives us a possible view of way may come. Would you be comfortable with a computer that almost human or would you detested the very idea? It's a bit kinky and for an older audience then most of their pervious works like Card Captor Sakura or Rayearth. The artwork dulled down too but not in a negative way.The cutest and perhaps best thing about the comic is Plum. With a cute ""notebook"" like her maybe this future isn't to weird after all."
1, Peanuts Holiday Collection: This was awesome! It brought back many childhood memories and now its helping to create new memories for all of the younger children and grandchildren in the family.
1, Great Product!: No issues here - quality is great and I've yet to run into any problems. I love using this media!
1," George Arliss Remembered, by John Rogerson, movie enthusiast: George Arliss, in his day a top star, is today the least-remembered of any, which makes this book especially welcome. Too bad its style is a bit pedestrian, but it does whet the appetite for Arliss's largely-unavailable output (Amazon has, through its contract supliers, his Oscar-winning ""Disrael"" and ""The Iron Duke"" and ""Dr. Syn"", and Movies Unlimited has ""The Guv'ner"" and ""East Meets West"", but his reputed two best, ""The House of Rothschild"" and ""The Man Who Played God"" don't seem available anywhere). The book points out Arliss's dedication (he insisted on two weeks's reheasal before shooting, even if he had to pay the Cast himself), sterling character (never a hint of scandal, no marital infidelity, etc), and modesty (he had full charge of all films and often wrote or rewrote screenplays, but insisted on being billed solely as an actor). For further info, see his two autobiographies, ""Up the Years from Bloomsbury"" and ""George Arliss""."
0," QK2 is a disapointment...: Queensryche, in trying to keep up with mainstream popularity, is continually changing their style, much to the dismay of their original audience. This album lacks the great melodies set by guitarist DeGarmo that was seen in prior albums Operation Mindcrime and Empire. Furthermore, this new album is missing the climatic choruses that Queensryche used to excel at. It seems that this band is trying to keep up with contemporary artists instead of relying on what made them popular in the first place. An overall disapointment... especially after reading that this new album will do what Def Leppard's Euphoria had done... back to their roots. Not happening."
1," A good read - but a bit fanciful: I've done a good deal of research myself on Deborah, the prophetess judge. I read this book and it's a good read. It gives insight as to what 'could have been' and Bette Ross says she did a good deal of research and took a lot of things into account. That's fine, but if you're re-telling a Bible story to enhance it, and give more meaning and understanding to it, I believe the story told should at the very least be accurate to the Bible story. Bette freely admits that there were a few things/locations she changed because she took ""other sources"" into account over and above the Biblical account in Judges. I still liked it though. Her characters were all strong though. The Bible said that ""men were weak."" There weren't many of those ""weak"" men in Bette's story."
1," An inviting introduction to fencing: Excellent discussion of the unique characteristics of the three fencing weapons! Not only descriptive of the swords and actions; Nick explains the positive relationship between foil, epee and sabre. Learning each sword in turn builds a fencers vocabulary.Being grounded in the knowledge of how each weapon works gives a fencer the ability to determine how well they are doing on the fencing strip. Nick gives a fencer the tools to evaluate the effectiveness of an action. Want to know why an action you used was effective? If your answer is ""because I got a touch"", you will have great difficulty bouting with fencers more skilled than yourself.Great information on composing attacks and developing timing, distance, speed and more. A special treat is the section with biographies of prominent fencers.A fun book to read and one that will give you insight into the rich, colorful tradition of fencing."
0," Tight Fit: If you have a Canon A630 as I do, it not a desirable case. It like a woman who like to wear tight blue jeans. You can just barely button it up. Forget about carrying extra batteries or extra SD memory cards."
1," Good Companion to Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0: Well written, worth the money. Get Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0 to make a great matched pair. Items that are in one book may be missing from the other and vice versa."
1," Great Name Tags: I used to try to using 2"" x 4"" shipping labels for my name tags at meetings, but they kept falling off. These name badges are of excellent quality and remain affixed to your shirt or jacket without leaving any sticky residue when you take them off after the meeting. I highly recommend these name badges."
1," Redemption in style: A super fun, stylized action movie that moves at a nice pace. An East meets West movie that is different from all the others I've seen. Everything is packed into this film, action, romance, revenge, and a bit of a moral story. Grab some popcorn and enjoy."
1," Unhappy Dog: The cats and the human family all like it .... the dog not so much. It's a great concept with the pet door, but I don't think the solder joints are as nicely done on this Carlson gate as they are on the Regalo gates I have. Unfortunately, the latter doesn't offer the pet door option. What's more, the Carlson stays nicely anchored to the door jam without having to use the screw-in cups. It's also worth mentioning that although the description says the gate fits from 29"" and up, I have installed it in a doorway that's just 28 3/4"" wide, so it might help others to know that it will fit slightly under the 29"". Both brands look so similar, even right down to the colors and the latch, that I think they may be manufactured by the same company but under different names."
1," Great movie great DVD!: I am a fan of the Friday the 13th series but i've only watched bits of this one. I thought it was time to buy it on the DVD Deluxe Edition! The movie it self is great! Its already on one of my favorites, maybe even the best in the series. Ted White easily became my favorite Jason (use to be Kane Hodder in part 6 and 7), he owned the role. In real life he is a straight shooter which obviously came out in his portrayal as Jason. Even though he said clearly in interviews in black and white he did it for the money he still stole the show. The DVD extras are also cool, showing never before scene outtakes, scenes, and an alternate ending. I recommend this item.Movie: 4/5DVD: 5/5"
0," Bad Investment: I chose this to use with my mobile phone in my home office but it turned out to be incompatible. I checked the specs before ordering, and it said it matched my phone but the plug is too large. I can use it with my landline but considering that I rarely use that phone AND that this headset is really bulky and will not stay in place on my head, it is simply not worth trying. I also have trouble hearing through the ear piece - the volume is supposed to be adjustable with noise reduction technology but it does not function well. I definitely regret this purchase."
1," Very convenient - just tip and grind: We love the convenience of this pepper mill because you don't have to press and hold a button as you do for many of the others.Bought one from Amazon after the one we bought in a store finally died. The previous one had been used for about 3 years ... almost every day. Even with fresh batteries, it just whirred without producing any ground pepper and it didn't seem to be jammed. It is unfortunate that it didn't last any longer, but for the price and convenience, we feel that the product it worth it.We'll probably buy additional ones for gifts and maybe a spare for ourselves."
1, Kids loved it: The kids love this movie and watched it twice in a row while mom cooked Christmas dinner. I recommend it
0," Broken Reservoir: Had the unit for a couple months. It had trouble maintaining desired humidity of a small bedroom with the door closed. Overall, a decent unit but not spectacular. Needed cleaning every couple days, but my water is definitely hard -- so it was to be expected.However, after a couple months, I was filling the reservoir and the handle broke off. The reservoir instantly shattered after an 8 inch fall to the side of the bathtub. The handle it turns out uses very poor glue. I had two hands on the reservoir, and was rotating it back to upright position after screwing the cap back on. I would estimate probably maximum 10 pounds of pressure.I would not recommend this unit even if the reservoir hadn't broken. The parts/pads are a pain to get, support is non-existent, humidifier performance/features is nothing to get horny about, and the Kaz company might as well not exist. Honeywell is a name only."
0, This thing is junk save your money.: I don't know how anybody can give this junk a good rating. My Not-so-Magic Slug died after 6 weeks. Because I did not buy it from the mfg. they would not honor the warranty. I bought it from a seller on that auction web site and he would not honor the warranty either. Get a Kitchen Aid or Oster product you'll have it the rest of your life and you won't be giving your hard earned money to crooks like the guys that make the Smoke and Mirrors Bullet.
1, cult movie: this movie is a must for all who lov cinemabeginnig of ''osé '' cinema liberation of the 60' exposed
1," Favorite baby product, by far!: I got this for my second baby, born Nov 2010. We turn this on whenever it is nap time and it immediately calms him down and helps him fall asleep. It also drowns out noise that my husband and I make, so we don't wake him up. I also use it while my toddler naps to drown out noise. We use it multiple times a day, and I still haven't needed to change the batteries. The noise machine easily comes out of the sheep for easy washing. It gets quite loud, definitely loud enough to be effective for soothing a newborn who is used to the loud womb. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish there were an option to not have it automatically shut off. It would be nice for it to stay on for entire naps so I don't wake my kids up in our small house by making noise. I definitely recommend this product! It's my most useful baby item other than swaddling blankets, pacis, and baby carriers."
0," Not very useful: These cards are very basic and the definitions, formulas, etc... are over simplified. I could see how these would be useful to a beginner but they are of very limited use to anyone with enough experience to actually take the PMI exam"
1, nice watch: I purchased this watch for my wife as a Christmas present. It's a nice looking watch but it needed a new battery within about a week. I wish Amazon would send a second battery if they sit on this inventory that long.
1," Great: just a dandy book, would like a more updated version of it, have some questions it doesnt answer but a good book all the same."
0," Dear Author:: Nonplussed does not mean 'unruffled' or 'unconcerned' or even 'not bothered.' It means 'confused.' That's right, confused; like I am when you use 'nonplussed' inappropriately. Figure it out before you publish, please. The book was going really well for me until ""Pitt grinned, nonplussed."" Now you know."
1," Your Hit Parade - The Unforgettable '50's: I am a great fan of 1950's music. However, I purchased this CD specifically for one song - Guess Who by Jesse Belvin. Unfortunately, the listing was incorrect and the song is not actually on the CD. I was disappointed. Otherwise, the CD is great."
0," Read the other reviews first!: Unfortunately, I was looking at the price when I bought this and didn't read the reviews here at amazon. Big mistake! My experience with this product has been what many others here are reporting: It breaks quickly (mine broke the 2nd day!) and starts skipping or stops playing music altogether (sometimes, if I don't turn it off when it does this, it will resume playing later, at some random time). Basically, it doesn't work. This ended up being a waste of money for me!"
0," Should have been better.: For nearly 80 minutes, Two Mules for Sister Sara is an enjoyable and decent Comedy/Western that is ruined by a plot twist that pretty much negates the interesting development of all that came before it. It's almost as if though director Don Siegel and the screenwriter wanted to take the easy way out.Then, there's the climax, which features a violent and long battle sequence that is actually very impressively choreographed. So, why would I complain about it? Probably because it feels quite out of tone with the material before it. It's more like a sequence I would expect from one of Clint Eastwood's more bleak Westerns, like his Spaghetti trilogy. Still, this sequence isn't anywhere as much a betrayal to the film as the ""twist.""As for the performances, both Eastwood and Shirly MacLaine are good. Eastwood is as enjoyable to watch as ever and gets some good laughs."
1," Typical Bentley Little....: Little's work is extremely formulaic - he takes something innocuous (like insurance) and creates an unbelievably creepy story. There is no realism in Little's work - but then again, it IS fiction, so we shouldn't be overly surprised at that. His work is formulaic, but it works so well. The policy is probably one of Little's more disturbing stories."
1, Frontier Uprising: A good western. I didn't know it had been made. It was a good depiction of what life would have been like in that time; entertaining.
1, Good for its pricw: This banjo is very good for its price. It was shipped without any flaws and is able to maintain its tune without having to continuously adjust the strings. This is a good for any beginner.
0, Not what i thought it was: i didn't look at my product very good. I thought it was more durable. It was very light weight and more for a todler who has an indoor pool with no wind. My bad
0," Stranger Safety DVD: A really bad DVD. It's too loud and my son was just requesting to turn of the sound. It was confusing and to much unrelated actions. I am very disappointed, I thought with John Walsh as a co producer it would be more informative and educational. I was looking for a child appropriate product that would help me to educate my kids without scaring them. It was a waste of money. The only useful product I found is The Berensteins STRANGER book."

0," Flimsy: A lot of reviewers are critical of the brightness, but I my complaint is with the mechanism that extends the legs for tripod mode. I've owned it for four days and it broke. Now the legs are permanently extended, or more precisely, they won't retract all the way. My estimation is that it's overpriced at $20+."
0," Never Again: I ordered this item in time for delivery before Christmas but it took Office Depot SIX WEEKS to ship it to me. When the item arrived, it did not work. Pressing the power button did absolutely nothing; the unit simply would not turn on. Now I have to go through the enormous hassle of shipping the freakin' thing back to them. I will not be ordering from this seller again."
0, Not worth it!: This bra has an akward fit. I had to return it. A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret.
1," A guide packed with charts, color photos, and more: Relax in a home spa - but choose one wisely: there are many models and possibilities on the market with a sometimes-bewildering array of features. Sanderfoot's Hot Tubs, Saunas & Steam Baths: A Guide To Planning And Designing Your Home Health Spa covers all these options, from colored waters which change hues according to mood desired to electric heater and cleaning problems, basic maintenance, to building an actual spa with wood and a steam generator. All the options are covered in a guide packed with charts, color photos, and more."
0, Players are non-repairable and non-servicable: If you have problems with your player you will not get help from phillips. The customer support I got informed me that the players are not servicable and not repairable. Did not see that information while purchasing product. The support is set up where you only get an option to type chat with an associate which is a clue to the service you will get. Hope you do not find out as I did.
1, rome total war review: This game is fun but it could ues more spots fore trops.I also like the places u can pick i also like that you can pick elephants but i dont like that you can only pick elephants on 3 teams.
0," Terrible Gameplay: Being a huge fan of Lords of the Realm 2, I had high expectations for Lords 3. After playing it, the $20 price tag makes sense. In my opinion, the game is horrible. They've taken all of the best aspects from Lords of the Realm 2, removed them, and fixed up the graphics a bit (which aren't too impressive). Most the economical aspects of Lords 2 have been destroyed, and the battles are fairly boring and somewhat buggy. After waiting for a long time for this release I'm extremely dissapointed. If I could return this game for half the cost I payed for it I would."
1, Great wall hanging: This was Christmas gift and the person that received it did like it. The only thing I could complain about was it was not exactly flat so I needed to manipulate it a little so when they hung it it would be flush against the wall. Looks very cute hung.
0," Mr. Lindsey's interpretations prove to be completely wrong: Mr. Lindsey's interpretations suggest that the Bible points to current (1970's) political alliances and states as the evil empires that herald the end of the age, the battle of armegeddon and the second coming of Christ. These events should have played out in the eighties. Instead, the Soviet bloc has collapsed, Egypt and other middle east states have made peace with Israel and completely new problems exist that were unforseen at the time the book was written. In short, there is a very good reason that this book is out of print. It is an embarassment to the author."
1, kids loved it.: My kids also received a couple more battery packs besides this one and seems to be working just fine right now
1, Worth Purchasing!!: This book is perfect for those teachers who want to start a Reader's and Writer's Workshop in their classrooms but are confused as to where to begin. The book basically tells you what mini lessons to teach and how to teach them the first month of school. This book is definitely worth purchasing!!
0," Bulb is not replaceable: I had this lantern for over 5 years. Used mainly for camping. The unit is great and durable. BUT now that the bulb is burnt, I disassembled the unit to get to the bulb. The bulb attached by wire to the battery unit. I research replacement bulbs and guess what - there is no replacement. Now this unit will go into the trash and fill the land field. How sad when the problem could be resolved by buying another build. Don't waste you're hard money on this unit. BAD CALL GE!"
1," Most accurate depiction of South Beach: I came to Amazon to buy a copy of this book for a gift, and read some AWFUL reviews about it, and yet to MY view, there's no question that this is ABSOLUTELY the best book ever written about South Beach. OK, our main character Hugo is a bit ""wise"" for a 16-year-old, and his references, allusions, etc., are over the head of most kids his age today (or in '93 when this was written), but for quality of tone, an on-the-mark conceit about South Beach and characters that ring true for South Beach, no book written before or after this one comes close to capturing what the environment (and the people) are really like down here. And who says you have to ""like the characters"" to have a ""good book""? Any of these reviewers ever read a guy named Shakespeare? I'll stick with Hugo."
0," Waste of money: It's not badly written or anything, but it's just useless. You can beat this game without any guide, and besides that, you can find most of it online anyway (for FREE!)"
1," Obsessed!: I watched the first 3 seasons on Netflix, and then I had to buy the last on Amazon because I love this show so much. It has the perfect amount of humor and seriousness. Definitely five stars!!!"
1," Super Cute: I bought this poster and a few others for my sister in law 40th 80's bday bash.The poster is super cute, now my niece has it hanging in her room. The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because I wish I would have read what size this poster is. It was very small like 1 foot by 2 feet and for the cost it was pretty expensive. For a larger poster I would have been more okay with spending more."
1," Interesting on many levels: This ""Essay in Book's Clothing"" can be appreciated on three levels.1 - At the surface, it's a pedantic description of the subject. What is bull****? What isn't? Why? How does it differ from lying?2 - At a secondary level, one might interpret the whole essay as bull****ing on bull****. I suspect this was not intended as the purpose of the essay, but it is an interpretation.3 - If you take it seriously, the essay is an attack on cultural reletavism - the idea that truth is not objective. The author attacks bull****ters not because they lie, but that they have a complete disregard for the truth. At least liars respect the truth enough to be false. The bull**** artist does not care one way or the other.It's a bit wordy in getting the point across (strange for a 67 page book!) but still worth reading. It won't take long to understand it - honest!"
0, I did not see any improvement: After a couple weeks of steady use I failed to see an improvement on a chronic ingrown hair. Maybe is works for those lil annoyances that go away on their own anyway but it was not a help for me.
0," Meh.: Doesn't move as much as I'd hoped. Also, my driveway and walk aren't completely level, which makes this thing somewhat challenged. Wish it worked better."

0," Very outdated: This book does not really discuss or show how to manage the more modern hydrponic techniques, but was good basic information for the beginner"

0," Unfinished release, wait for the finished product: They made their release deadline, but at what cost?You have to get a patch just to get started, then some of the area maps are missing, {how can you attack Pearl Harbor when it's not there?}, some aircraft they said you could fly,... well... you can't, and the patches are already up to 3.4 and megabytes of fixes...... maybe they'll come out with the finished version sometime.... otherwise buy it for $0.01 and find patches online, just to see the intro!"

0," FATAL DESIGN FLAW!: The Light Engine/optical block of this TV has a fatal design flaw. it is the subject of a class action lawsuit against Sony. The picture may look great at first by gradually begins to fail, producing the dreaded ""green blob."" I have had the light engine replace 4 times with no success. Do a google search on sxrd green blob class action. Stay away from this TV!"
1," well built, functional: This is a well built, if overly large CATV/Coax switch, usable for a variety of purposes for anything that uses a coax (such as RG7 or RG59) with CATV-'F' type connectors. I use a switch of this type into my digital modem from my cable internet WAN service: occasionally I have to reset the cable model, I find that not only do i have to disconnect the power supply, I also have to disconnect the incoming cable (there's a bit of power coming in there as well, a full power-down for cold boot requires all sources to be disconnected). This switch is a handy way of doing that without having to unscrew the incoming F connector. While this switch is more solidly built and appears better than the very inexpensive 'game select' type of cable slide switch, the switching mechanism inside the box could be built a little more solidly to reduce signal db loss; but all-in-all this is a good cable switch."
1," Excellent Video for Beginners: For years, I've been recommending either Total Yoga (1992) or Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Stamina Version. Now that Tracey Rich and Ganga White have put out the three Flow Series tapes, I now recommend the Water version of the Flow Series to beginners in decent shape. If you are over weight, have old injuries, or haven't exercised in decades, then get the first level tape - Earth. But for most people just looking to get started in a flowing yoga style, nothing beats this Water tape. It's forty-five minutes of a safe, well-rounded program. If you want a 20-minute, not as well-rounded program, then get the Stamina Version of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga. I am so glad these two finally made more tapes. I just wish they'd hurry up and get the whole thing on DVD. Anyway, if you want more of a challenge and like to sweat, get the Fire version or check out David Swenson's Yoga Short Forms.Oh yea, one more thing. Be safe and watch any video at least once before you just jump in.Enjoy!"
1," Great Hoody: This hood is great for people who don't like to wear bulky jackets but don't want to be freezing cold either. The outside is plain, which is hard to find anymore, except for the UA symbol under the neck (That logo is a little more distinctive on the actually hoody than shown in the picture, not necessarily a bad thing really and it might be great if you like that, I just wanted to point it out.Fit: fits well around the neck, not too tight (which is why I usually hate pull-overs), not sloppy either. The arms are roomy and allow for full movement which I love. Its long enough to allow you to extend your arms over your head without the bottom coming half way up your stomach. I'm about 6'2 and the bottom of the hood and the sleeves are plenty long enough.The inside is a brushed fleece that is comfortable and warm. I wore this hood this morning, it was about 35 degrees out and I had a T underneath it and was perfectly fine.Overall, I am really happy with the hood for what I paid for it."
1, Buddah Bob and his cosmic snow globe: This movie rocks. Solid story. In HD format the visuals will blow you away. The bigger the TV the better it looks. The HD transfer is stunning! If you're considering this as an upgrade to your standard definition version of the film do not hesitate - add it to your cart already!
0," 2 Great Singers. 12 Great Songs. 1 Ho-hum Album.: I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying ""yes, dear"" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.I love sax. I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family. But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy ""smooth jazz"" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.Note to Word Lovers: ""Treacle"" originally meant ""a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."" However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself."
1," Multi-use for Caregivers: These untreated swabs have worked very well for us in caring for our elderly Mother - and we've used them for different purposes.They are not quite as soft as those in the hospital, but we found that by running a bit of warm water over them and squeezing the excess, and then applying an oral gel made specifically for dry mouth to the swab, they were much softer and easier on the gums and tongue. Using the warm water method also works well for cleaning the mouth and inside of the cheeks.We also use them to clean her teeth with slightly cold water, careful not to touch the gums.Lastly, when only a small amount of liquid can be swallowed, these are perfect - dipping them in ice water or a mild juice, and then placing it on the tongue, so our Mom can suck the liquids from the sponge.The handles are long, and being plastic they hold up well. Each swab comes in a small wrapper, and we often snip off the ends of several to have them ready when needed."
1," Works fine 7 fins total not 9 but I am satisfied with it: OK, first of all I am very satisfied with the TRR0715. It is silent and heats the room well even on the 750 watt setting.Unlike the picture , the unit I received has 5 middle fins and 2 end fins for a total of 7. I don't know if they changed the model or used the wrong picture but I am satisfied with what I got and mention it because it seems to be a big issue."
1," Great product: It came quick and it was great. I don't like Michael Jackson's music, but it was great to give this gift to somebody that would appreciate it."
1," Had it for 5 years and couldn't get it clean anymore.....: So, I replaced it with the Pioneer Ceramic water fountain and after 2 months of that I bought a new Drinkwell. You can read my review of that here:Pioneer Pet 6022 WHITE Ceramic Drinking Fountain, Raindrop Design Smartcat With 3 Extra Filters (total of four)Drinkwell isn't so bad after all. I wouldn't recommend for dogs though."
0, Poor title: The title of the book is deceiving! There is absolutely nothing on VS.NET in this book. The materials covered in this book are also available in many other non-VS.NET .NET books. What a waste of my time and money!
1," Good hard driving blues live...: I bought this because I had remembered the Red Devils off the ""LA Rockabilly"" record that had come out in the 80's. That version of the band did rockabilly and had a female singer. The bass player in that band was Jonny Ray Bartel who would go on to play in the Knitters. When this record hit the stores I picked it up because of the name of the band and saw that Bartel was involved and decided to give it a try. I really did not know what to expect and was surprised it was a live blues record, and a damn fine one at that. This is tuff blues, not boohoo stuff. It is rough and edgy and it really is a shame this is all they really ever did. I wish more blues bands would take this road and not the keep doing the same old thing. This is a kick in the pants hard driving record that more people need to hear."
0," Aimed toward younger audience: I remember watching Men in Black a long time ago and I remember it being pretty good. So naturally, when I heard Men In Black 2 was coming I was ready to go see it. It turned out to be nothing I expected. I think the directors aimed this movie toward a younger audience. Because the jokes were very childish and my niece thought it was hilarious. Anyway, for a children's movie, it was decent, but I'm not watching it again, even though I like Disney movies...."
0," Esperaba mas de un maestro!: siempre he sido un gran fan de GUSTAVO CERATI lo he visto tocar en vivo y no le pide nada a los mejores djs del mundo sin embargo ahora que compre esta coleccion de sus CANCIONES ELEJIDAS pienso que relamente no eligio bien ya que nisiquiera puso en el cd mi cancion favorita TE LLEVO PARA QUE ME LLEVES,lo unico que salva a esta coleccion es el DVD que este si contiene toda su corta videografia en solitario y es excelente !"
1, Knitting Bible: This is the most comprehensive knitting problem solving book I have come across. I have a few other books on knitting and was never able to find the solutions to some issues. It also contained a cast on that I have been looking for the instructions on for years. I lost the book that contained those instructions in a move. That alone was worth the purchase price.
0," Disappointing: I'm a fan of Veggie Tales and generally love their music, but wasn't as impressed with this CD. We have the ""Veggie Tales: On the Road with Bob & Larry"" CD and love it. Unfortunately it wasn't the same for this Christmas Album."
0," Doesn't work -- brushes come off: On the second use of this product, the brushes came out and are stuck in my car CD player. Now I have to take it in and either have it repaired or replaced because nothing plays on it. Don't buy this unless it's a last ditch effort because you're going to buy a new player anyway."

1," Great Toy for the Price: My 6-year old son rec'd this birthday gift and was the only gift he played with (out of many gifts!). It's been very durable (the ramp does come off when picked up and moved, but simply put it back on), loads of fun for the kids and I am buying it for his friend's birthday at the end of this month. Thank you."
0," ISMS: I choose this book because readers who read Joam Medlicott had read Ross. Big mistake on my part. Sexism and ageism as the bases of a story is not my cup of tea. Nor does Ross's writing, character development or southern flavor come through in a rich, delightful way. The dignity, insight and autonomy I loved in the Covington books are completely absent in this piece of fictional waste. Skip it I say."
0, Cheap for a reason: This worked great for one 4 hour drive. Tried to use it a month later and it is dead dead dead.
1," Wonderful Whisk: I love the design of this whisk. I've always been concerned with traditional whisks in that the wires cross over each other -- food gets caught while blending and the wires tend to rust over time. However, with this whisk, none of those things will ever happen. This is extremely high quality, heavy and looks nice as well. I highly recommend this product!!!"
1, im glad this movie finally came out on dvd best wrestling movie ever.: i enjoy this movie when i was a huge fan of wrestling and when hulk hogan was a huge superstar of wrestling at that time and the first time i saw big man tommy tiny lister when he was way before the neighbor hood bully in friday Debo wasnt thought then lol
0," Almost started a fire: The charger charged my battery once. The second time I attempted to charge the battery it made a high pitched noise as if it was about to short out. I tried it several times over the course of the day. I threw it away because it was either going to ruin my battery (might be ruined - I have not attempted to charge it again) or start a fire (likely). Not that it has anything to do with evaluating a poorly made product, but I'm an engineer.Also, it was not compact in any sense of the word. It is much larger and more awkward than the original charger from Sony. I would highly recommend buying the Sony charger and not wasting the time and money on this product or any other product by this manufacturer."
1," Not Deeply Personal: More than the biography of Eleanor, Weir's account describes where Eleanor's life intersects with the major figures and events in European history of the 12th century. The historical accounts focus upon Eleanor's documented activites and include those of her husbands and children. The historical accounts of Henry II, Richard I, and John I develop well beyond their relationships with Eleanor. Weir's account portrays a cultured,intelligent, and beautiful woman who develops shrewdness and wisedom."
0, WEW Lost: In one word this is a lousy DVD. It is the worst of the genre. It is also too short but it is better that way. too bad i cannot get a refund. Also Christina Ricci (film Actress) is not in this title. Shoddy advertising.
0," NOT FOR 2ND GEN!: The title says it fits a 2nd gen, but once I put it on the iPod didn't go all the way in. Which leads me to believe its really for the 1st gen iPod because for the rounded edges.I thought it would look great cause Im a big time giants fan and thought this would make my old iPod look great but it doesn't fit. Although the case is really sturdy and even has a protective cover over the screen and looks just like the pic. I used it a few times but it just looks awful with the iPod sticking out, the main reason I use cases is to prevent scrathes on my iPod but it will get scrathed when I use it in the car."
1, the best of horror vol 1 and vol 2: these are some good movies the picture is clear and the sound is good but the movies are not widescreen they are fullscreen
1," Go for your Dreams: Why not? Keep your head on straight enough to be healthy and love. However, why not go for your deepest dreams with everything you've got? You may not buy everything in this film, but hey, a closed mind gathers no knowledge. Give it a chance and take what you want and leave the rest for another moment."
1," Weather: The Company You Keep offers plot twists, social ideas, and carefully researched historical detail from the Vietnam era. Each alone would make for a worthwhile reading experience. But at the novel's heart is character. Which deserves one's deepest loyalty: parent or principle, child or country, mother or daughter? Written in a new take on an epistolary form---one that puts the reader in the mind of the intended audience (a character in the book) to sit as judge to the upheaval of the sixties and its consequences---Neil Gordon's novel is a gem. After reading it, you will think differently whenever people talk about the weather.Robert Redford optioned The Company You Keep for a movie, and it's easy to see why."
0," Rehash and Fluff: Just a few years back Mr. Karas wrote Business Plan for the Body, which made a real contribution to the field of physical fitness and weight loss. Following his guidelines, I was able to shed sixty pounds of unwanted fat. Unfortunately this particular book is mostly an abbreviated rehash of Business Plan. It's not that the information provided is bad, it's only that it is an abbreviated repeat of his prior book, but not as well organized nor as cogently presented. Beware any book that doesn't have an index!!"
0," Pathetic.: That word sums up the entire book...I had to read it for my English class, but regardless, it's an awfully dull book. It's feministic and there is no plot to speak of. The characters are fairly well developed, but apart from that, it's just a waster of time."
1," Lucid and charming, this book will make you alive again!: Alan Watts, best known as the foremost interpreter of Zen Buhddism to the West. A Masters in Theology and a Doctorate in Divinity, Dr. Watts pulls together insecurities of our own lives that have been unaware to us, and puts them in our laps to review. Our insecurities of what religion teaches us to believe and what science claims as actual fact. Alan Watts writes this is in almost poetic form and nature, bringing to life the beauty, not only in his words, but in the life before you as well"
1," Engaging storytelling, priceless archive footage: If you ever heard Stewart Copeland speaking in public (take podcast of 2004 O'Reily Conference for example) you already know that listening to the man is quite entertainig experience. Mr. Copeland is great storyteller with a sense of humour and it shows in the film. One other thing is that this movie is not your ordinary ""Behind the Music"" documentatry, but real-deal archive footage, straight from the center of events. C'mon, where else does a music fan get this kind of stuff? And lastly, Stewart's production chops are good - great editing, directing and scoring, all done by the man himself. I liked this DVD a lot."
1," Not bad at all: Movie was failry exciting , interesting and a decent amount of martial arts and tai chi. The best part is that it had a lot of positive messages in it!~shauns movie review"
0," Give it a miss: I bought this DVD and was totally disapointed - as some have mentioned already the sound is absolute crap, yes I know it was recorded late 70s but hey even the original star wars had brilliant sound...Im giving my copy to the local library after forcing myself to listen to it twice. Guess I will have to be happy with my old albums."
1, My Review of Bones Series 2: Good entertainment and one that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in forensic and crime seen investigations.
1," It's a Keeper: The book is a great read, it not only contains suggestions and ideas for writing with a guitar, but it contains many enjoyable popular songs to help demonstrate the writer's ideas and suggestions. It's the type of book you want to hold onto and read again every once in a while in an effort to help re-enforce what you have learned. Find a permanent place on your bookshelf for this one."
0," Give it a miss: This book was nothing more than an incessant rant about Chinese bureaucracy and Chinese people. I'd strongly advise you to give it a miss, because in a little over 50 pages, it will start getting on your nerves. It is very hard for me to believe that someone could travel this long, yet not find one good word to say about the people or the place. The gist of the book is the paragraph where he compared China to an army-every thing else is essentially elaborating this theme.If you want to know how one can be funny without being offensive, read Douglas Adams's account of his visit to China in ""Last Chance to See""."
1," easily one of the best of all time: flat out brilliant, thats all that can be said. read it for yourself and find out."
0," Not worth your money: The recipes and wine suggestions are all right, but the plot is improbable, and the characters are badly drawn. People fall in love for no particular reson and murder one another for even fewer reasons. It took me forever to wade through it even though it is a short easy read."
1," Great camera: The design is awesome!I bought this camera for a relative for Christmas but I did familiarize with the camera before wrapping it. The camera is awesome. I love the swivel lens. It seems to be very sturdy. The pictures come out very clear on the lcd screen.The shutter speed on the camera seems to be adequate.Since I was buying this camera for a man I wanted to make sure that the camera wasn't 'dainty'. This camera is a nice size, not too big and not to small.The video mode is spectacular. I love that it has audio.The camera is very easy to operate. I was able to use the features without using the manuel!The zoom is lacking a smidge. I would not say that it is good for 10x opti but I would definately say it is a great 8x opti.I think the camera is well worth the money. I looked at several other cameras for 5 months and decided on this one and I definately feel like I got the best deal.Highly recommended to everyone who wants a great digitial camera with a unique design."
1, Great: Delivery was fast. The product is great. This Sequence game is larger than the game board and very easy to read making the game much more enjoyable.

0," total waste of money!!: Don't waste your money on this product. It looks cute but that is it, ours did not look like the one pictured the face was black not grey on both of them. It does not take aaa like it says on the box instead it takes AA It started falling apart the first day we got them. We bought them for our 6 year old twins for their bday. Within 2 days they broke completely and all they did was take them to bed with them and hold them at night. The red never showed up at night. Save your money and buy night lights and glow in the dark star stickers and put them on the ceiling. A word of advise from a very unhappy customer.."
1," A treasure for etiquette & good manners lovers: This book is certainly a treasure to hold. In its pages, history of good manners and utensiles is displayed. It presents many pictures and diagrams explainning the fine art of entertaining and showcasing beautiful silverware, cristalware,flatware and their the correct use. Through my career as a event planner and expert in ettiquete I haven't found any other book as complete as this one. Certainly a must-read for anyone who loves refinement."
0," Poor Quality, Bad Support: I installed this product and got it configured. Everything was working properly, both on the LAN and over the Internet. After a week, the device was no longer visible on the network (LAN nor Internet). The D-Link configuration program could not see it on the LAN, it could not be pinged, and following the instructions to reset the device and restore the factory defaults did not resolve the problem. D-Link's support, which is based in India, was not helpful and could not understand that the camera was physically 3,000 miles away from where I was."
0, Naive claims: It's absurd to pay this much for AV cables. There is no difference in quality between these and the run of the mill ones you got in decades past. Save your money.
0, Waste of $: Unless you are living a very boring life and have too much time on your hands then I don't recommend.
0," Not what was pictured.: I am sure that this gauze will meet my needs, and it is my ""bad"" for not reading the add more closely, but the picture shows individually wrapped packages of fluff gauze by the Kendall companuy with the name Kerlix on it with one opened roll in front of it, and in the body of the ad it states that this is by the Dukal Company. Their ad says that they are ""Kerlix type"" I received 100 pieces as promised, in a box, and those were NOT individually wrapped. They were in a large plastic bag, in bulk in the box. I don't really mind that they are not Kendall, but do not show a picture of one thing and then send another. At least send individually wrapped packages, and DO NOT show another companies photo for a product. It would seem to me that that was meant to deceive the customer. I will keep these and use them, but please change your picture."
0," Horrible depiction of parenting: I thought this book may have potential to be witty and filled with great observations from the other half (dad being primary care giver). It was a disappointing, whining, boring, ""soap box"" that made not only working mothers look bad, but also stay-at-homers and everything in-between! I had a very hard time finishing it, and then considered it a complete waste of time. This guy does more whining and complaining then both of my children on an eight hour car trip! YUCK - - -AND - It's easy to raise one child - I would love to see the character when number two and three come along!Good Luck!"
1, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban: Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is a great story. It is in a different league than any other book. J.K.Rowling is an excellent author. The most exciting part is when Sirius Black sends Harry the Firebolt and Gryfinndor win the Quidditch cup.
1," A little pricey, but a great knife.: I agree with the other reviewers: this knife initially struck me as being too expensive for a run-of-the-mill linerlock, but I liked the styling so I bought it anyway (it was closer to $50 at the time). It's a heavy knife, and the scales on the handle give it some of that weight. The blade is nice, and stays pretty sharp. I recently took this knife with me on a hiking trip on the Appalachian trail, and I had no problems with it. At it's current price ($33) it's probably a good deal."
1, Rodney Dangerfield: Rodney Dangerfield is always a laugh. 4th Tenor is a movie about a singer. Laugh until you cry. I love funny movies.
1," nice small trinket: The seller was great and the craftmanship of figurine excellent. However, couldn't tell from picture that has stones in collar--would have preferred without or at least choice of color. (Figurine is about 2 inches tall)"
0," Junk: It will peel and crack, and then it can't be fixed- and your boots will be ruined. It's a short cut and no substitute for proper bootblacking."
1, Read the whole series of novellas: I really love these characters and Mrs. Hatcher left me wanting more!! This is just book one and I downloaded the whole Hart's Crossing series (I paid for it) after I read this first one.
0," Not the best quality: This paper just wasn't as good as I'd expected it to be. It never held vibrant colors well, and I tried on multiple printers. The colors just seemed dull on this paper. Also, the backing wasn't sticky enough and it peeled off of the paper bags I had put them on. Overall, I was not satisfied with this purchase."
0," Do not use with bleach: I cannot say 100 percent that these gloves are responsible for turning a white shirt purple, but all I can say is that I was soaking a white shirt in bleach because it had a small beige tea stain. When I removed the shirt from the bleach and wrung it out, I took it outside only to be shocked that the entire sleeve had turned the same purple color as the gloves! Is there a warning on the box not to use with bleach? Why else would I need rubber gloves? After sitting in the sun for four hours, the shirt faded from bright purple to dingy yellow, so it is still ruined."
1," A Masterpiece: I can't add anything to what has already been said.If you are not a crumpled, emotional wreck by the last piano note in ""One For My Baby"", then you're not alive.The finest recording of American popular song I have ever heard."
0, collected works of justice holmes: It has not arrived It has not arrived It has not arrivedI was last sent a broken single book and these are supposed to be the replacement. The time gap is excessive and so is this form.
1," Signature Branagh: The film should have been renamed ""Iago"" instead of Othello, because it's yet another ego-vehicle for Kenneth Branagh. He overshadows the main character, played by Laurence Fishburne. The film itself is gorgeously shot and very sexual, but it definitely has a modern feel to it. The cover makes it look like interracial softcore porn. It was probably intended to be a serious movie, but certain costume inaccuracies are just too obvious."
1," dbz fan: This latest version of dragonball z budokai is the best out of all three,but i knew that this game was pretty good because i'd rented it before i bout it.but there are some draw backs about this game there are characters on this game that aren't even on the show or the movies and i've seen probably every episode from dragon ball/dragonball z and dragonball gt but the games are better than the suspence from the shows.overall i'd recamend that if you are a dragonball fan then you should buy this game."
1," Curious George's Complete Adventures: This hardcover book is excellent! I gave it to my nephew as a birthday present and we have been reading the stories morning, noon, and night! He cannot get enough of Curious George and this book is the perfect fit for us! This book is a must-have for any family with children that love Curious George!"

1," Works If you Keep them Charges and Scented: The idea is you make them smell attractive and when the deer touch them they get shocked and stay away. So to be effective you have to maintain the sent until all the deer that wander through you neighborhoods stay clear of your yard. They work best if you have a small group that stay fairly close. They will stay clear once shocked and it appears to continue even if the polls are no longer active. The but here is that if you have lots of deer that wander in and out, then you will have to keep them scented and active continuously. If you have something more attractive like ripe peaches or other fruit they will ignore the poles and go for the fruit."
1," Gardengirl.1223: A great way to take the stress out of the HOLIdays. Just sitting, decorating or baking. The music puts you in the spirit of Christmas. I would recommend it for all ages. Especially children who are already over charged this time of year. I listened to it the week after Christmas and I believe I enjoyed it even more. Do not be afraid to send for it. You will not be disappointed."
0," Not what I thought it was: I was expecting a book weighted toward doodling; idea-generation; capturing thoughts on paper. I was disappointed to find it more oriented toward graphic artists or illustrators. Lots of topics like composition, perspective, etc. And the sample sketches and examples are way way more professional than I could ever hope to be. Bottom-line, I found it more oriented toward illustrators or artists than toward thinkers who want to doodle."
1," A ""Must-Have"" for any Raider fan out there: This is two DVD's packed full of Raider highlights starting from the first year in the American Football League up to their last Super Bowl appearance two seasons ago. Special features include pieces on John Madden, Lyle Alzado and George Blanda. Disc 2 has the 1997 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts in Baltimore along with features with rivals like Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Denver. This DVD you will never get tired of watching."
0," Lock broke immediately: I bought this as a would-be Christmas gift for my grandson. I tried it first and unlocked the door using the code given but was unable to re-lock it. After several attempts to lock the box, the lock jammed and would not turn in any direction and the door would not lock. Needless to say, I returned it and am presently looking at other options."
0," back to the woodshed...: As you age, your supposed to be less impulsive. A lesson, that with the purchase of this CD, I clearly have not learned. I heard the terrific update of ""Stoned Soul Picnic"" on a ""jazz"" station and within ten minutes or so I had ordered it. I had the first two SOS albums and liked them, so I thought 'how could I go wrong...'Well folks, not one of my better ideas. The basic tenant of songwriting is melody. The melodies on this CD come in a distant third behind overly ambitious arrangements and some of the worst engineering I've ever heard in a modern recording. I can't hear the music for the music, and I wish I could. I would love to hear these songs presented in a simple, clear and dynamic form. SOS's music is full of an optimism that is sorely lacking in pop music these days, but the overproduction keeps me from getting to it. SOS Unplugged? What a concept. In the meantime, I've learned my lesson with the most expensive single I ever bought."
1, Harumph... and I did NOt intended these five starts to be there!: Even for its intended audience my impression is that this books is a bit toooo basic in many counts. I rarely regret buying books but this was one I'd not recommend unless it's for really beginning kids with an interested in the subject. Two stars would be OK!
1, RUTLAND FIREPLACE GLASS CLEANER: I use a heavy duty wet paper towel with some of this product. I rub it on and can see the residue on the glass come off on the paper towel. Turn the towel to a clean area . Apply another dob of product to the towel and clean another section of the glass. Continue this process until all the galss is clean. Then wipe it with a clean wet cloth followed by a clean dry cloth. It works quite well.
1," Great classic intro to Holy Scripture: We read and understood the stories in this book when we were two years old -- they were that simple and clear. Elsie Egermeier did a great job interpreting Holy Scripture for tiny kids without getting pedantic or avoiding the facts. While it contains both Old and New Testaments, it is suitable for Jewish children. I would choose this book over the smarmy ""Uncle Arthur's"" or any other retelling of Bible stories for kids. Bring back the old edition, with its classy dark cover with the famous portrait of Christ on it."
0, Color Not As Pictured: The wooden colored pieces are silver and the silver colored pieces are brown. It will stand up without gluing but I glued mine so that I could move it around easily.
1," For a time when the world tries to bring you down: After reading bird by bird for the first time it became a book I returned to everytime I couldn't write or I couldn't find any good reasons to keep on writing, or just simply when everybody laughed about my desire to bring words into the page, somehow Annie Lamott saved me every time, just like this film portrait will do the same, an experience to charge energy like those who attended her seminars."
0," Don't do it !: Weak. The sex scenes weren't good enough to qualify it as a porn flick. And the script was too weak to carry off any kind of a storyline. At least not one worth watching all the way through. The only reason I did was because I'd already spent the money and I hoped it would get better. It didn't. I DO think Jerry Louis is funny, but I still don't understand the french."
1," Nearly perfect premier recording: Nearly perfect premier recording of a great Handel Opera.The music,without a doubt,is fantastic,try Clotilde's Act IIAria""Combattuta da due venti""with it's sweeping String writing,like a storm(CD II;track 9),or the Act III Duet for Clotilde and Adolfo""Cara!/Caro!""(CD III;track 5).But the singers,although theygive a good performance here,are vocally imperfect.Julianne Bairdis much too whispery,and Mary Ellen Callahan's voice too whiney.The other singers are rather gruff at times.But despite this it'sstill a great recording,with a lot to offer.This recording,withthe excellent Brewer chamber Orchestra,led by Rudolf Palmer,Livesup to their previous Imeneo recording."
0," Boring and useless: I bought this one after reading ""Astrologically Incorrect for Lover's"" expecting it to be as good or at least as funny. Unfortunately it is not. I had a good laugh at the Aries section with my Aries friend as it was very accurate but it provided no more information than I've seen elsewhere. The other signs fall flat in this book as the author tends to dwell on only one characteristic of each sign. The title of this makes it sound like a much more stimulating read than it actually is. The follow-up ""...for Lover's"" is much better. I would also recommend the ""Darkside Zodiac"" as it is more interesting and very funny."
0," A Large Disappointment: I was so excited about this book because I LOVE the ""Dark"" series and all the other non-Dark books Ms. Feehan has published. I understand that there are only so many Dark characters and books that can be published, but this book seemed too far fetched, even for me. I had to force myself to not only finish the book, but to even get half way through it. After about 150 pages the plot picked up then about 25 pages later I was again disappointed and the aburpt ending was a complete let down. Nomally, I recommend Ms. Feehan to anyone I see reading a book, but this is not a book I would recommend to anyone.I would not recommend you purchase this book if you have not already. However, as a truly devoted fan when the next book is released, and there WILL be a next book, I will give it another chance. Hopefully by then Ms. Feehan will have added her special flare that has made me wait with great anticipation for her next book. If not, then this is a series I will not continue."
0," Ultimately, a failure: This book is an interesting read, but it fails in its state aim of establishing Shakespeare as the inventor of ""Western Man"" as we know him. I suspect that this is because the book is based on a very shaky premise. I'd be the first person to acknowledge the contributions of the Bard to thought but I dispute the claim that he invented the modern human personality.My other complaint lies in the fact that Bloom resorts to pedantry and verbiage to present his tenuous ideas. Particularly tiresome are his long expostulations on Hamlet and Falstaff (two of Bloom's favourite characters).The only reason I give this book 2 stars is that it presents a grand overview of Shakespeare's works. It contributes little to our understanding of the human being or literature. I'd just lump this book along with the countless others that indulge in empty and verbose Bardolatory."
1," Enjoyable, but not that unique: I'm a sucker for a good romance book. I really enjoyed this book. It reminds me of Lynsay Sands Argeneu Vampire series. The only problems I had was that it was a little too formulaic. You knew the end at the beginning. I had a little trouble following the Gods, because I do not have a lot of knowledge of ancient Greek history or the Gods, but enjoyed reading about them. I would have liked that to be described a little more. Kenyon expects you to know what Aphrodite, Athena, eros etc are the Gods OF.One thing I really liked was that Grace, the female character was normal! She wasn't beautiful (except to Julian), she wasn't extremely strong, just an average girl. I read this book very quickly and couldn't put it down. It held many similarities to the Black Dagger Brotherhood (which I loved), but nowhere near as dark. I will read the next few in the series, but may get bored if it is the same boy who hates himself meets girl who changes him formula."
1," A great movie with a great actor: It has been several years since I,ve seen this movie and it was great. Larry Parks did a great job of acting the part. I have been looking for this video for sometime now and finally found it. I have been wanting to see it again. Thanks. Roger A. Hyndman"
1," A must for every grandmother: This is a book I will take with me whenever I visit our grandson. It has everything! I can read to him, do activities with him, cook with him, and as a result of this book, I'm sure he will look forward to our visits. Thanks you, Lena Tabori and Alice Wong, for putting this book together."
1," Alexander Hamilton: Very detailed account of the great man's life and the temperament that got him killed. Sometimes, the story line gets lost in all of the explanation, however. A really amazing book at a ridiculously low price!"
0," Will you get your money back?: Be careful of Venapro's so-called 90-day ""Money Back Guarantee."" The guarantee only applies to unopended, unused product. So, if you opened a bottle, used it, and it did not work (as is the case with me), they will not give you your money back."

0," Just not the same: Although I enjoy piano versions of music, this album was just not the same for me as the original new age concept music. Oldfield has commented in his autobiography that the insight which gave him his first two albums seems in some ways to have been lost forever, and for me there is simply nothing like the original versions of Tubular Bells and Hergest Ridge."
1," Don't take this book so seriously...: Parents that hate this book are expecting some great literary read. Wake up. It's a childrens book. Guess what? Children, especially young ones like repetition.My now 11 month old has loved this book since she was 6 months old. Her first statement was ""please baby"" which comes out...""peas baby"". So cute. If I ever want to make her smile in public, I just lean over and whisper in her ear. ""Please, baby, please""....Again, so cute.I will admit after reading it 3 times in a row, I try to distract her so I can hide it, but like I said before, it's a children's book:)"
0," died after 11 months of home use: I liked my Big Disk Exterme with its three interfaces (USB 2.0, Firewire 400 & 800) for its speed. I was slightly annoyed by the constant noise it generated when running. After a few minutes of inactivity, the drive spins down. When idle, it needs about 15 seconds to spin up again.After 11 months of light home use, one of both disks inside (Hitachi Deskstar HDT725050VLAT80) stopped spinning up, rendering the device useless.If you ever notice an interrupt in its spin-up sound, do not switch it off. Connect another hard disk and copy over as much as possible. After I first noticed the irregular spin-up sound, the drive died within three days."
1," nice: this is the full 6 Season of the show. the package is well designed, just one little detail: the disks comes protected by a piece of paper and sometimes the glue add to it and the paper breaks. everything else is so good,"

1," Review of Bombs, Cities, & Civilians: This is not an action-packed blow-by-blow account of battles, it's about U.S. WW II bombing strategy -- the most analytical, insightful, source material based book I've read in my admittedly limited WW II reading. The author is a real scholar -- I'll be passing this book to friends and reading other books by the author."
0," the great profile goes bolshy!: a bizarre mixture of revenge and forgiveness set against the russian revolution of 1917, with john barrymore giving a dreadful performance as a wrongfully imprisoned soldier turned bolshevik. barrymore gave many fine performances (see ""jekyll & hyde"" or ""beloved rogue"" in silents, or ""counsellor at law"" or ""20th century"" in talkies); this is not among them."
0," Be Warned... This is the cut version!: Further to one of the other reviews on this page, this is indeed a truncated version of the original film, which is a shame, as the plot is actually more involving than most. If you weren't aware of the original ending, the film seems complete, but the actual finale would give the film an extra ironic punch that this version lacks."
0," Disappointed 17 month old and mother!: I had extremely high hopes for this toy. I decided to purchase over another brand because it was ""Parenting Mom Tested-Toy of the Year Winner."" Well those Parenting Moms must be magic since they can actually get this toy to work like it is intended. I followed the directions, even priming 20 times like the directions state if bubbles don't appear. Maybe 1 out of every 10-15 times the handle is pushed down a stream of bubbles appear. My toddler doesn't have that much patience! I tried wiping the top off after every try, refilled the bubble solution, even waiting for solution to settle overnight (thinking air bubbles might interfere). Needless to say, this toy will be going back to the store."
1," Red Whitney And Blue: I'm not enamored of absolutely everything Whitney Houston ever recorded. As a friend once said, ""Pick a NOTE and stick with it."" That always gave me a chuckle: all that gospelly glissando COULD get on my nerves. But at her peak (and when she was on her game), Whitney really could be spectacular.She was here."
1, cute gift...: I got 2 of these for gifts...for a 7 and 11 year old. Both really liked it and they were excited to get into it and figure out how to paint their nail and try interesting designs.
1, The Not-So-Silent Christmas: This book came recommended as a good possibility for a Children's Christmas program. I am pleased with what I read and am looking forward to using it at church.
1," It's okay I guess: I expected a lot of amazing clothes but there weren't a ton of different ones (just same style, different color) and most of them I didn't like or looked weird on the Sim. I'd still recommend it if you want a wider selection of clothes, plus it is cool to be able to build an actual HM store, but I expected more than what I got."
0," Still using trans fats: They are tasty, but Carr's (aka United Biscuits in the UK) has refused to reformulate away from trans fats, which are dreadfully unhealthy, and have been replaced with much less noxious ingredients (eg palm oil or butter) by almost all other premium cookie manufacturers. Shame on them."
1," Her self-deprecating humor delivers the laughs: Another reviewer once said there should be a 4.5 and she's right! If I'd never read a Laurie Notaro book, this would be a definite 5. But I've read five others and so it came in just under the high-flying scale. She has me totally convinced that she's the dorkiest girl alive until I realize that she's admitted that - so it's a Catch-22. You can't be truly dorky if you know you are...I can so relate to the crazy things that happen to Laurie as she lives out her life in a seemingly haphazard fashion. Much of the stuff she does I do myself. What no one does as well as Laurie Notaro is describe the events so that you are waiting for one outcome and are totally surprised by another. She's got gumption, that gal - and she regularly makes me laugh out loud in this book, like all the others."

Even the cover art is just as horrid; it's a blown up, quality degraded photo. To top things off, the DVD menu looks like it was produced with some ""cheese bag"" software. I am SHOCKED & amazed that Amazon is allowing this DVD-R to be sold at all. Yecchh!"

0," Not Good This Time: The first season and the prequel were great. Vengeance was weak. The character of Spartacus was poorly cast, and it didn't help having the storyline they wrote for him. The guy's all of a sudden changed to a politician, giving speeches every episode to a disorganized horde to stop them from destroying each other, followed by, ""Yeeeaaaahhhh!!!"" Lots of times the story gets goofy and unbelievable. The new Naevia isn't good either.The thing that made Spartacus work before was Batiatus. Without him, and combined with the loss of Andy Whitfield, it's just over. I understand that if the story were to continue any further, the story of the ludus and the arena needed to end. But the current cast of characters, without a great lead actor or two, and the lack of good writing to make up for it has ruined the show. And with the people who were killed off at the end of Vengeance, it makes the next and final season seem like there's absolutely no hope for an ending worth watching."
0," Scratch: But not this one: Don't get me wrong, Lee ""Scratch"" is the man, or was the man, and this is a worthwhile collection, but only for those who have most everything else of his early years and are so addicted to Scratch that they're looking to complete their collection. There are a few nice tracks, but these are all available otherwise. Overall, a so-so album."
1," A gift for all to share: Through courageously sharing his own life experiences, Alan Clement's book ""Instinct for freedom: Finding Liberation Through Living"" adds a wonderful perspective on how we can affect our destiny. In reading Instinct for freedom, I am reminded that the ""acts of compassion"" through our daily acts of courage and love, truly define our humanity, our strength, our oneness.In our own Quest for freedom the awakening to our true self, it is ever more apparent how important that the freedom of all people comes into play. Instinct for freedom is a beautiful contribution in a time when the need for hope, courage and compassion is so purposeful......Highly recommended!"

1, I'm Very Glad This Book Was Written: Thank you Sedgwick Tourison for shedding light on a group of South Vietnamese patriots I would have never otherwise known about. They truly paid a heavy price for their patriotism. I wish to God that some of their North Vietnamese captors could have been on the receiving end of the Geneva Convention.
1," A Great Start!: The author gives a wonderful overview of the topic of privacy. The book itself is an easy ready, and very funny. Even if one does not wish to lower their financial profile, I would recommend this book (just for the entertainment value).For those with fewer assets, or who wish to keep all of their activity within the U.S., I would also like to recommend ""Bullet Proof Privacy"" by Boston T Party."
1, very nice: it's actually very nice than in the picture. although it is abit darker than i thought. fit is perfect as well.
0," Hardly an ""Ultimate"" Collection: In addition to other criticisms of this set (an edited Can't Get You Outta My Head video and leaving a number of videos off), the audio is only in 2.0 stereo. This is a big disappointment as her concert videos were released with 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks. Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the ""Money Can't Buy"" DVD). Finally, all the widescreen videos are non-anamorphic and look horrible when (if you have a widescreen television) you have to zoom in on the videos."
1," powerful reality - these are our kids: It is difficult to accept the reality that so many children in our affluent society are broken and thown away, ignored or forgotten. These stories provide the personal connection to the statisitics. They also tell me how far we need to go before we call ourselves ""evolved"" ""enlightened"" or ""civilized"". Reading the stories of Carlos, Marcos and Kam is a way for me to connect. I am gratefu that Kathy VanAntwerp has told the stories, the question is what will I do with them? I read them with an open heart and a willingness to accept the children's voices and experiences even though I wish none of it were true. I turn to this book for motivation and strength to continue to speak and act on behalf of children in all small and large ways that I can."
0," Oprah lays an egg: The acting in this was incredible, and there were a lot of great scenes, but the movie is just horrendous to have to sit through, rarely makes any sense, and ultimately is completely unsatisfying. Toward the end, it became comedic for me (perhaps I had been sitting in the theatre too long), I found myself rooting AGAINST Oprah's character, and I thought the Beah Richards cameo was over-hyped. If you liked the book and/or like Oprah, give it a try. If not, stay away at all costs!"
0," bad publishing: This edition is unreadable because all the type runs together so that as you are reading youget wordsrun together likethis. I quit trying. I intend to read this book, not this edition because I love Cather and the subject interests me."
0," If you love to continually re-install the printer software driver, this is the printer for you!: I heartedly agree with so many of the negative comments posted here. Yes, this printer does have some good days. Copy feature is decent. The HP Image Zone software included does some really nice touch-up work to scanned documents. BUT---The printer does not handle 4x6 photos at all. They slip causing a paper jam that creates a printer error that will NOT go away. Cannot cancel print, cannot clear, the error jams the entire printer and prevents printing any subsequent documents. Cannot even DELETE the printer. Requires complete software reinstallation. I would never recommend this printer to anyone who has an interest in using the printer for photos. It is the pits."
1," Duma -- A Wonderful Coming of Age Story: I orginally thought that this was a child's movie and my child did thoroughly enjoy it, but I did too. This is a film for adults as well as kids. It is very well written, well acted and a beautifully filmed. This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, and inspire you. Do yourself a favor and view this remarkable little gem!"

0," Streams of confusing consciousness: This, like all of Osho's books I have read, seems to contain a lot of words and very little content. There are snippets that offer food for thought but overall it is repetitive and, in my view, poorly written."
0, Just another persons opinion: If you are looking for information this book (As the title says) does not provide information on the medical side of Cancer. It is about people involved in the day to day struggle of living with and hopefully recovering from this disease. I don't think this is a bad book and some people may love the human qualitites it brings to the disease it just was not in my opinion the correct book for me at the time I read it.
0," Medically speaking, it's a horrendioma!: As I sat in the theater, I tried to prevent the overwhelming feeling of nausea from overtaking me. This movie lacks all the essentials to good movie making except one: special effects. The issue is that there now are too many other movies with excellent, nay, BETTER special effects than AOTC.Personally, I was blown away by Lord of the Rings and The Matrix. Lucas is clearly bringing nothing to table at this point in his career.I am NOT looking forward to the next film."
1," Fun songs ... muddled words: My 8 yr old daughter is learning her skip counting well with these songs to prepare for 3rd grade. It gives you time to think about which number you are in by talking about ""Learnin' our fours"". As a Hannah Montana/Gabrielle Montez wannabe, my daughter really liked the hip hop/rock elements of these cool songs. However, some of the numbers and words are tough to make out. I had to type out the numbers before they were memorized so she understood them. I looked at all skip counting cds out there, and this, by far was the best!"
1," Recieved very quickly: Well I looked at the box and yes it was exactly what I expected. Fit, quality was just right works like a champ. Them deer ain't gonna have a chance now and save my back. I would recommend this product from this vendor - no hassle and very prompt with responses."
1, The only color mixing book you'll ever need: I airbrush and oil paint and have bought several different color guides and this is the only one I will ever need. The colors in it as references are easily available in most brands of paints and the mixing ratios are easy to understand and transfer to any quantity you need. You can't go wrong when it tells you to mix 1 part naphthol crimson to 1 part cerulean blue to get a brick red...the only other thing I would consider getting with this book is the Magic Palette guide to hang on the wall where I paint.

I have also read lots of other Janice Vancleave books. they were just as fantastic as this one. I think lots of you people would read more Janice Vancleave books if they read one before. This book will really help you at a Science fair."

0," Bad Research, Worse Results: Let me begin with the end of the book, the Bibliography: It lists a number of fine Catholic apologetic works from Keating and Hahn which answer the authors poor arguments, many times over. It is obvious he did not read these, but just placed them here as a sham.This is an uneducated author in biblical research and church history, not to mention a person with an already established agenda which will not be deterred by the facts.It is a true shame to unleash this type of drivel on the average educated American church-goer....anyone who has internet access can easily verify his nebulous and some untrue statements.So sad. If you want ALL the answers (and truthful, reasearched information as well) to this sloppy, mealy-mouthed tirade, go read Karl Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism. You can trust it."
1," ease of operation: I buy quite a bit of food in bulk.

The actual MK-105P has only one set of clamps and can only charge one battery. Amazon made a ""mistake"" by substituting a picture of a different model. Now I have to send it back. Not to sound paranoid, but this is the second time this has happened to me in three weeks with trying to buy boat items from Amazon. I'm going to my local marine store from now on, as the price difference isn't significant once you factor in the shipping from Amazon. Sloppy work Amazon..."
1, Great buy: Excellent TRW steel arm with quality bushings and ball joint. Didn't see any 'China' stamps / labels / or other signs of that.
0," Not the best out there: I was thinking of buying this game when it came out but instead rented it first. I was glad I rented it. I would not wanted to play 50 dollars for such a low quality game. First off this is really not a card game and should not be called one. It is more like checkers and you will find the players very hard to beat. I do not mind a challenge but come on, this is insane. You also start off with weak cards that your opponent can destroy 90 percent of the time. The tutor is well done though so you can learn how to play pretty quickly. I would buy the game if I found it for 15 to 20 bucks but I would not pay 50 dollars for such a game. If you want to play the true card game play Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelists Soul for GBA, which in my opinion is the best YGO game out. I would deeply recommend you rent it before buying it. It is not too good."
1," The hearts and minds of South Africans haven't changed: In this stunning novel, Mr Galgut tells the story of a fugitive from justice hitchhiking in the desolate backdrop of South Africa and who is picked up by a driver, a minister on his way to a remote parish. When the minister discovers that the hitchhiker is a fugitive and confronts him in a disused quarry, the response is lethal.This novel is a masterpiece featuring a story and characters utterly compelling. The author shows that even the quietest spots on earth can seethe with repressed violence. A blunt and tense read about guilt and evasion of truth. Justly enough, Mr Galgut has been compared to the greatest South African writers like Andr? Brink, Nadine Gordimer, J.M. Coetzee and Achmat Dangor."
1," More than just a book: This isn't just a book. It is a work of prophecy. It's a real grabber. So are the sequels. This book will create much thought and given our current political landscape, this book is a must read."
0," Don't bother. Read Lady Chatterley's Lover, instead: All of the characters were odious. I found it really hard to actually finish this book. The pomposity of the writing was too much. The whole book was very off-putting. I don't know if the author actually wanted you to like any of the characters, but I didn't. And the only reason I finished this book is so that I can continue towards my goal for this year. I'm glad I've read other works by Lawrence or this book would have turned me off of him forever."

0," Global perhaps, commentary, not!: I bought this book to review as a potential classroom text.It is a jumble of ways to misuse the Bible to support modern revisionist theology.According to this book, inclusiveness, cultural relativism and subjective morality are the primary message of the Bible.Other topics which pass for biblical commentary include Interclass power struggles, feminist identity and the misogynist patriarchal society, liberation theology, etcMy opinion...Unless you are really interested in far left apologetics, save your money."
1," Overlooked alblum that shouldn't be...: Don't be fooled by the one poor review here, this alblum ROCKS. It's probably my favorite of the Petty alblums after Torpedos and maybe Hard Promises but at any rate this is one great alblum. It's certainly of the earlier, more raw Petty sound found on his earlier workds. I for one prefer the older, more raw Petty sound to the highly produced sound that came out with Full Moon Fever. I own numerous Petty alblums, yet this seems to be the one I play most often of them all."
0," NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!: Despite being advertised as ""Closed Captioned""...There is NO captioning on this disc, other than Spanish ""sub-titles"". I carefully look for closed captioned titles before purchase. Don't they know that with-out captions...these videos are worthless for the deaf?"
0," Don't waste your money: My husband and I purchased this item recently and we never even got to give it a try. It supposedly holds up to 300lbs, and the first time my husband sat on it, the side seam blew out. Not a little hole, literally the entire side seam. My husband weighs around 220lbs, and he went crashing to the floor. Not fun or funny, we were lucky he wasn't injured.Of course the store we purchased it from did not allow refunds or replacement. The manufacturer is overseas and hard to contact.I bought a couple bags of bean bag filler and a 22"" zipper and turned it into a bean bag, an overpriced bean bag."
0," I would not recommend this one: I give it one star due to the fact that they are far worse quality compared to very similarly priced HD 202. Maybe they look better and feel more comfortable, but the drivers are lower quality, and they are much higher impedance than most headphones are, resulting at much lower sound levels. What I find, I have to crank the computer volume to 100% and sometimes it is still not loud enough, especially for some youtube video clips where a person speaks softly.Buy HD 202, a far better option for about the same price. See my review on it as well.If Sennheiser would take 201 frame and put 202 drivers in it, that would be a far better option, and might be worth extra 10 bucks, but as is, 201 is considered junk in my opinion, having used several Sennheiser models including their true professional level units.Avoid this model."
0," Loud & Weak!: the fan makes noise a minimum speed and really loud at max speed. If it blows out a lot of air, then it's acceptable; however, I hardly feel any air from 13"" away. It's too noisy to be comfortable!"
1," Great pictures, great info!: I thought this book was terrific. It had great pictures and great information. The book gave you the good and bad points of every single one of the 51 cars in the book. The only disapointment was, it didn't tell you how much the cars cost. If you want great pictures or great information or both, this is the book to get. With the Ferrari F40, AC Cobra, Dodge Charger,Lamborghini Diablo, and many more, this is one book no car lover should be without.Nelson Elliott"
0," Not For iMac: I love Scrabble and was looking to put the game on my iMac. Although this particular product claims to work with MAC, it does not."
1," At long last!: Fox finally released this classic. It was a favorite film from my youth. My only complaint is the commentary. My eyes crossed over again and again as I listened to Darryl Hickman pouting and complaining of how he was treated as a child actor. Come on Darryl, grow up. Couldn't they find somebody better to describe this wonderful film? In fact, as I listened to his whining I, for the first time ever, was not horrified to see the drowning scene. I was glad to see the little creep drown. Nice going, Gene. By the way, I echo the sentimentts of another reviewer who is wondering if Fox will give us Jeanne Crain's delightful ""Margie""."
0, Used plus: Used was a understatement when describing this book Writing in book was correct Most every page had writing in crayon or pen along with stickers placed on the pages In addition the back of the book was broken and a chunk of the cover was missing
0," WEIRD: This movie was out there! Weird sums it up. Crap horror movie. Movie dragged, acting was terrible and the clown didn't scare me! Blah!!!"
0," Fiction: I find all of these ""responces"" to Dan browns book to be ludicris! The Davinci Code is a novel people, a work of fiction. If it causes anyone to investigate history, art, or heven forbid their faith, that is terrific! The more educated you are about religion, it's history, art, and world influence, the better armed you will become against those who will try to sell fiction as fact. Mr. Brown has not tried to sell his story as fact, rather he call what he has written a ""novel"" a work of fiction. Please do your homework before buying anyone's stories as fact, even if it is your pastor/priest/rabbi/mulla 's story."
1, A must read book for Siegfried and Roy Fan's!!: This is wonderful book that describes the high's and low's in the lives of Siegfried and Roy. It is a very heartwarming book. It shows to others that dreams can come true if you just hold on to your beliefs. The road to fame and fortune had been a very hard and long road for these really special people. They show over and over again that not compromising your values does pay off. The book is great for all. We read it with our kids and they liked it very much. Just as their show it is appropriate for all ages. Especially read it before you see their show and you will appreciate it all the more. Read the book and experience the magic!!
0," Tubb for the purist: If you like original 1940's quality music then this is for you.l Unfortunately the CD sounds like it was recorded in 1946. The selection is great, with Mr. Tubb's distinctive voice in the foreground. Unfortunately the background music is almost not there. The music sounds mono, flat, lifeless. Look for a re-mastered version."
0," Not worth it: The device works, but the quality of the music is so bad that you won't be able to enjoy it."
1," worth every penny: ...and since you can usually find here for a penny, what are you waiting for?you know how sometimes you'll roll the dice on a CD in the bargain bin you know nothing about, then get it home and it's crap? be assured that won't happen here. PUB is a small classic, and one of the best records you've never heard. just look at all these other fans on here!if you're already a fan, you can reach out and touch the man via his profile on one of the more popular networking/stalking sites out there; he's denzilpub"
1, enjoyable: I try not to watch new movies because they are time wasters and most of them suck but this one was a pleasant suprise. I find myself laughing even on the 7th viewing. I even recommend this one to homophobes(like my dad). Funner if watched with a group of people.
1," The honesty in Lowry's STARS is strong and moving: Lowry's first Newbery tells the story of Annemarie Johansen, a ten-year-old who is glad not to have to be couragous. But when she is, her life is changed forever. The only downgrade is that story had a sad ending. But that is needed, I suppose, for a story such as this, with a message of friendship and courage written in between the lines. The thrill in this, though, is that it is honest and true, not masking the horrors of the time. Serves as a good beginning to a study of the time period, especially for young children. (Reccomended.)"
1," So good, I would buy it twice!: Of all the films that Shannon Whirry has been in, this is her best. I had the opportunity to view this film's NR director's cut on video and would gladly pay the cash to buy this DVD again when that version comes out. I would rate the NR version at 5 stars. Best of genre!"
0," Distracting Sound Effects: I have tried this CD for 2 months. I cannot go into a trance because of the sound effects. The Hypnotist uses phrases in a repeat mode, furthermore he shifts the repeated sound from one earphone to the other. In one case he directs the subject to repeat the phrase and then loops the phrase 10 or more times so fast you cannot possibly repeat it. He has a good voice and experience, but he got carried away with recording gimmicks."
1," A misunderstood book.....: This book is not a gate way of evil, nor a devil worshiping hand book. I have read through it many times and have found that it is a hand book on how to invoke the Elder gods, and other spirits to help you in your life and to keep the ancient ones, who are evil(if you follow this ""religon""). And how to prevent these evil ones from accessing earth. Of course wheather you think this is real or a short story it is very entertaining, and puts many things in your life in perspective. Buy it or borrow it, just read it."
0," Mattel Barbie 3-Story Dream House: My 3 year old loves this Dreamhouse. However, the electrical part of it stopped working after about 10 minutes. I tried several new batteries and nothing. Mattel made me ship back all of the tiny pieces (at my own expense) and they will be sending me a new Dreamhouse in a FEW WEEKS. (By the way, the rep. at Mattel was making me send even more of the house back but I asked for her manager and then I was told just the tiny accessories) It was very hard explaining to a 3 year old that I had to take most of the house away from her in order for them to send her a new house that works. I'm not sure why I had to pay the shipping since I only had the house for a few minutes when it stopped working... Also, the windows fall out constantly and, the doors pop out of their tracks. I find it annoying but like I said, my daughter just keeps playing with it even without all of the little accessories..."
0," the kind of game when ya wanna brake the controller: When i got this game o was so excited as i had played the first medal of honor: Frontline, which was an awesome game, this game is so crappy, it's unbelievable, graphics are N64 compatible, voices are all of sync with the person who's talking, oh and dont even get me started on the controlles for the game, they are so messed up, you will spend half the time you play the game just trying to figure out how to play it, overall this game is just another one of those games that ends up with a broken controller."
0," Why: This is not Enya and it's not really Enya's music. Taking popular music and orchestrating it is an oft used and rarely successful experiment. This is not one of those occasions. Orchestraizing Enya loses all the magical qualities of the original, but adds nothing. Buy the originals!"
0," Maybe it's just a poorly designed toy: I'm not sure how you're supposed to use this toy, but I can tell you how my 2-year-old used it. She struggled with the pop-top for a little while, then realized that she could unscrew it, and after she did that, she poured out all the color directly into the bathwater. Then she looked at me and said, ""Daddy, fix it!"". After that, I opened the pop tops for her, but it's still an awkward toy to use -- too stiff to squeeze easily, and you have to keep the point down while writing, which is not too easy for little kids. I asked my wife what I was doing wrong, and she just said, ""maybe it's just a poorly designed toy."""
0," Worst performance: I am a genuine fan of Samuel Jackson - his recent fims such as Coach Carter and In my Country have proved his undoubted versatility as an actor. So what on earth induced him to get involved in such a trashy film - and to allow himself to be directed in such a way. His acting is atrocious, as is the rest of the film - feeble script, dismal cinematography and a complete bore. Sorry, but this had to be said !"
0," Disappointing: Lightweight, simplistic treatment of investing in apartment buildings. If you're serious about this subject, other books on Amazon are a better bet."
0," Plane lover - just not this airplane: This was a gift for our daughter's second birthday, who loves airplanes. This toy did not hold up to our expectations. It is heavy and durable, but it can not be steered making it difficult for a child to manuever. It is big and bulky, so storing it is a problem. Right now, the flyer is parked in my daughter's bedroom, which is probably not what the gift giver had in mind. Also, the steering wheel is easily dismantled by children, and the dismantled parts can be a potential choking hazard. I would not recommend this toy unless you just want it as a decoration in a child's room."
0," Overcoming Dyslexia: A New and Complete Science-Based Program for Reading Problems at Any Level: As a true dyslexic I think this book is a joke.....How can you even advertise this book as something that will help people with dyslexia when you are not even prepared to make it text to speech enabled on the kindle? This is like writing a book for the blind, but not allowing it to be published in Braille. I have not read this book because of the above reason, but would suggest that anyone reading it wonder how accurate and helpful the information is if they can't even see far enough to make their book text to speech enabled for the very people they are professing to help. I am giving this book a wide berth and I suggest other people who care about those with dyslexia do the same."
1," JOES AWESOME WORSHIP MUSIC: Twila Paris has had many awesome releases but this cd whichwas released about 10 years ago was one that I was looking for.Itcontained ""HUNGRY"" in the music version I was looking for.The othersongs on this cd are also very good.Love Heaven is my home.Good typeof worship music that is very smooth and will not give you a majorheadache from the BLAST of BEATS like some worship songs do.Twila has avery smooth or mellow music style.I have always loved her music andof all cds this one took me a few months to locate.No vendor was ableto find it with it being so old.Love that amazon service for locatingthis cd for me.Twila you are one Awesome singer and of all of your cdsI still say this one is tops!!!Look forward to continue buying yourmusic.Love ya girl................................."
1, Its in the characters not the country: While its' enjoyable to understand India through this book the real beauty of the book lies in Seth's development of the characters and how by the end of the book you think you feel like you just want to know more and more about them. Its similar in that way to Arundati Roy. Its' the characters rather than the Indian background that make both books excellent reading.
0," Are you serious: Basically the worst highlight film ever. It looks like it is footage from a camcorder fixed on a tv. Yea, tremendous. No game announcers or sound bites, just a horrible narrator. He sounds like he is in a bathroom talking into a microphone. They skip lots of games and show more of the Brazilian players being losers than of France celebrating. What a phenomenal way to waste 5 bucks, pleases save your money and just live off of your memories of France 98'."
0," Would I recommend this saw to a friend? Not likely!: I looked at several Jig Saw Brands and made the mistake of buying this Dewalt.The problem is the blade holding design.The blades shoot out during use.I called Dewalt and was instructed to follow the instructions for installing the blade.Duh...The fact is that the design is bad and Dewalt is sidestepping their responsibility.I own several other Dewalt power tools and they are all fine.This is the first time I've ever even contacted their customer service and I feel very let down by the response I received.I finally just gave up, threw the saw away, and bought a Bosch.Now that I know how Dewalt stands behind their products I don't think I'll ever buy another Dewalt product.Would I recommend this saw to a friend?Not likely."
1," Unabridged Dictionary: This replaced a 1986 version, and it was nice to have the ""new words"" section, although I wished those words had been incorporated into the main dictionary. Short of ordering the entire OED I guess this will suffice. I have tried some of the electronic dictionaries and they just do not compete with the real thing."
1, A Bright Star on the Horizon: I think Rahsann Patterson's voice is truly unique. I enjoy listening to him and I have sold several of my friends into buying his music. I really hope he soon gets the praise that he truly deserves.
1," heroes and villains: A story of an ugly chapter in Vietnam, that took a toll in lives then and continues to do so. A story buried for years by some of the same people who messed up this decade. Informative, and reading that one needs in order to understand the cost of war."
0, What a MESS!!: It leaked water & dirt. All over the clean kitchen floor.I bought this unit before reading the amazon reviews.Because I read that others had problems with the unit leaking I fortunately had my towels ready just in case.It's going back. It did a so-so job of cleaning. I'm going to try something else.
1," GREAT FILM! NATALIE PORTMAN IS AWESOME.: Beautiful Girls was an outstanding film. It was the first time I'd ever seen Natalie Portman, and she was extraordinary! The movie had a great story line, with a wonderful cast that really pulled it together. When is this going to be available on DVD?"
1, Good Buy: Good family film with a learning lesson for the child and parents--worth watching together. Kids will watch it over and over.
0," Kolobos: When first viewing this film, i thought that it was a copy of the Blair Witch Project due to the first person camera views. After about 10 minutes this changes to a third party view after the main cast get to the house, this is where the film goes down hill and becomes a horror to watch not that it was scary but because of the poor acting and special FX, even so there were a few funny moments."
0," It doesn't work.: My laptop actually overheated faster with this product underneath it. The way the product is quilted prevented the fan in my laptop from being able to suck in the air it needs to cool the computer. Too bad--it's a great idea. Unfortunately, the product description is too good to be true."
1," Another Great Repaiman Jack Novel: What can I say? Like Stephen King, I am hooked on Repairman Jack. These novels read like a weird combination of X-Files and the Rockford Files. Jack always get drawn into stories that cross over into ""the otherness"".I enjoyed Harbingers and thought it was one of the better Repairman Jack stories. We get to see a little bit more of Jack and his family of characters. To see a little more of what makes Jack tick."
0, Damaged product: This product took a very long time to deliver and when received was badly damaged. Several corners were bent over and there were more than a dozen marred spots on the piece. Very disappointed.
1," This Kevin Costner apdaption could save his career.: Kevin Costner found the David Brin book and turned into a 3 hour film, And it could had saved his box office career. Costner is a Drifter without a name, An Shelter seeking Con-man of a devastated America, He discovers a Mail Man's uniform and decides to re-store the wrecked country, and Combat General Bethelem and his Hell-born Holonists."
0," Do not need it: The manual was not written by a professional or educator in land surveying. The manual delivers only quite superficial coverage to each category in surveying. Although the author managed to involved many relevant information from coded sources, in-depth discussions and delivery of critical fundamental concepts are unavailable.The manual may be somewhat useful for civil engineering students with none or minimal surveying knowledge, but too much over-simplified ABCs for students possess certain basis surveying knowledge.It contents not even adequate materials for LSIT exams.It still could be a concise guide for Civil Professional Engineering candidates in reviewing surveying topics; however, it will not satisfy any other purposes for LS exams, advanced students, or professionals.If you are buying references in surveying topics intended for in-depth purpose, try something else."
1," Good Service, Good Response: Rec'd the product in a timely manner, no problems at all with ordering or the shipping. Very pleased."
1, Perfect Pet House: I purchased one waffle block house for my guinea pig and one for my daughter's guinea pig. They both love it and moved right in! Snaps together quickly and nice thick blocks another great chew toy for the piggies. Translucent colors so you can see your little pet in house.Great item. I keep it in playpen so when piggie is our for her run she has a place to hide and feel safe.
1, SEAT CABLE: THIS IS A GOOD OPTION IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LEAVING YOUR BIKE OUTDOORS AND DONT WANT TO LOSE YOUR SEATPOST OR SEAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU CUSTOMIZED YOUR BIKE.
0, The worst of the lot: While this movie reunites the original actors who portrayed Mike and Jody that about the only good thing this movie has to offer unless you rejoice at the fact that the tall man actually has more than one line to recite before he delivers death. But if you like to see more graphic slicing and dicing by the silver balls then this one should be to your liking.
0," Worthless: This looks like a USB data cable, but it isn't. It provides power, but no data. Utterly worthless purchase. Possibly false advertising."
1," Worth the money!: I recently had rotator cuff tendon surgery and when I got back to work I couldn't type at my computer without a lot of pain as my chair arms are too wide for me to use to support both arms. This arm support works wonderfully, can't see myself ever NOT using it. It supports my arm and saves my shoulder. It rotates and moves very smoothly and is very comfortable. It has practically become an extension of my arm. Recommend highly."
0," like her books, not this one.: I think this book is pretty outdated now. I also think that Bobbi's books tend to repeatthemselves. Pick your favorite and leave it at that. make it a current one."
1," Excellent Book: I've read through about 250 pages and so far this book is awesome. Grudem's theology is very consistent and Bible-based and I appreciate how his theology is consistently tied back to the inerrancy of The Word. In addition, this book is truly written from a teacher's perspective. It is easy to read but has deep meaning. Finally one of the best parts in my opinion is the section at the end of each chapter that has application questions (they're all very good and really make you think back on what you've read and what it has to do with your walk), a memory verse, and a hymn. If you aren't reading through those sections you're really missing out."
0," this book sucks: Being from Texas, I happen to love the Dallas Cowboys. I guess you have the right to write about anything you hate, and make money off it. Gee, I think I'll write a book about how I hate to change a stinky diaper, and I'll become rich too!"
1," Excellent: loved the item. its compact, classy and seems really well constructed. as reviewers already stated, the layers are think and should be more than enough to handle the rigors of travel. i only wish this had a small compartment or two but that would probably only make this case bulkier. this is a must for nuvi owners and is much better IMO than the garmin deluxe carry case."
1," Requested by my son for sharpening his hunting knives.: Lansky makes a quality line of products for sharpening knives. My husband has owned this same set for many years and has been well-satisfied with it. This year our son asked for ""a sharpening set like Dad has"" for sharpening hunting knives. This set is great because it includes stones of differing coarseness and a box to keep everything together. The stones put an excellent, sharp edge on knives, and on scissors."
1," Highly recommended. Beautiful singing and melodies.: CD has Odes and Welcome Songs. The songs are beautiful - rich, varying melodies and interesting texts, many about music. The singers are very good, including the great James Bowman. If you don't know him, it is a great chance. The singers sing in superb harmony. Summary: Highly recommended as essential ""Baroque"", ""Vocal"", ""Purcell"" or any other category!"
1," Nice to still be able to get these.: The bulbs came on time, triple wrapped in bubble wrap, and were in perfect condition. Nice to be able to get these when most all you can get are CFL bulbs now days!"
0," OMG: I think this is the worst movie I've ever watched, if I can say I watched it since fast forwarded 90% of it. Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, bad everything..."
1, MY AWAKENING by DAVID DUKE: This is the best book I have ever read concerning racial understanding.Dr. Duke describes the root causes to America's (and the world's)foremost problem.A MUST READ FOR ALL CLASSROOMS.I have bought multiple copies and given to all my relatives and friends.I have even pushed the book online at various Yahoo club sites and chat sites attracting the interest of thousands .Educate yourself and get this valuable book/Thank you
1," Broken Lizard is back!: Super Troopers has gained classic status, Beerfest is a hilarious flick, but the rest of Broken Lizard's movies just leave a bad not-so-funny taste in your mouth. Well put that out of your head because Slammin' Salmon is the possibly the best Broken Lizard movie yet. Full of quotes you'll be spouting to your friends for the next 6 months (""COLESLAW NEVER TASTED SO GOOD"")and some of the most outrageous scenes since Super Troopers; do not miss this new comedy classic."
1," one of the best ever made: together with adore, siamese dream is the best CD made by the pumpkins, and one of the best ever made. mayonaise is my personal favorite. the record has a light sound with some rock every now and then. the soft songs are most enjoyable to listen to though. the lyrics and the melodies are simply ingenious. nothing more to say, just: well done!"
0," Instant??: been three weeks , the dead parts of the lawn and my shoes are stained green however there has been no ""repair"""
1," Just what I needed....: Wow..I wonder who would'nt want to have these in their kitchen. These are probably the best kitchen items i have bought in a few months. Bake,serve,store,freeze,n dishwasher safe...these save me the trouble of transfering left overs to another bowl and again to another if i want to re serve them. They come with lids so another problem solved. They are very durable and I dont have to worry about matching them to my dinnerware. These go with everything. No plastic hazards and good for the environment as well...The only thing that disheartened me was that I ordered these for $20 and the very next day the price went down to $15. But I dint mind it as they are worth every penny !! I am so in love with these..."
1," a further note ....: Another reviewer mentioned that this book was the one Stevie Nicks was reading when she wrote Rhiannon and that the song was related to the story. A long time Fleetwood Mac fan, I pulled out the CD and listened to the song both while I was reading the book and after I was finished with it. Though it does follow to a very small extent, the mythology of the name Rhiannon, it doesn't reflect on the story at all. The Rhiannon of the book is cruel and extremely vicious, a character with no virtue, yet the song is not about a character like that.The same reviewer recommended the book if you like mythology. Celtic mythology is discussed in only the barest terms. It isn't discussed at length, only to the slightest extent.So if you are looking for insight into the song Rhiannon or looking for extensive mythology discussion, this is not the book for you. Buy a Celtic mythology book for the myths and buy the music CD for the beautiful song."
1, Great price and service.: Got to me in time for Father's day which I was concerned about. The items were packaged properly. This looks great in my Dad's sports display case instead of just some boring plastic box.
1," Well written book: It is a very easy book to read. I read it over a six hour flight. It starts with the very basics and takes one through to the most important of inequalities in Mathematics. While inequalities themselves can seem quite uninteresting, this book makes them interesting by focussing on the methodology used to arrive at them and the interesting results that they yield. The book is written in an easy converstational style, and intends to impart the reader not only with the knowledge of some basic inequalities but the authors also succeed in sharing some of the charm and fascination that they hold for pure Mathematics.I recommend it highly."
0," Wilson Phillips should have stayed retired: To listen to a compilation of cover songs, none of them coming close to their originals does not a comeback make. Wilson Phillips is a group with great potential and a great lineage who have squandered a chance to put out an album of original material in favor of retreads. What a shame......."
1," Is This Guy for Real?: Taking Michael Crichton's word on Henry James is sort of like listening to Gary Coleman criticizing Olivier, or Milli (or Vanilli) carping about Mozart.First of all, in the above non-review, the reader assumes we ""want to be swimming through crystal water,"" whatever that means. Well, I've swum through enough crystal water, and come away after the read with nothing. James's industrial strength extra chunky peanut butter sticks with me long after I've put it down. ""The Beast in the Jungle"" OR ""The Jolly Corner,"" two novellas, eclipse and obliterate the entire body of Crichton's work. Simple as that.""The Velvet Glove"" is a great find - the limousine ride stuck in my mind. ""The Birthplace"" is a riot, too. Try them-"
0," Failed to Captivate: I took a chance on ""Alexander"", even after all the horrible reviews the critics wrote about it, but every single one was right. I was practically asleep by the end of the movie. It skipped around far too much, if it weren't for the length of Colin Farrell's hair I would have had no idea what time period we were in. The acting was decent, except for the fact that almost every character save for Angelina Jolie had an IRISH accent. ""Alexander"" was based in Macedonia, not in Dublin! The look of the movie was fantastic, I would expect nothing less of the hugely talented Oliver Stone, but he failed to captivate me as he did so well with the Doors movie, in which he portrayed Jim Morrison fabulously and correctly. In the end, ""Alexander"" was a dud."
1," Jane's Decision...: Even though Seth told Jane that she would be coming home, he had to know the truth. Jane was in horrible pain and dying from a terminal disease. Who would want to ""live"" like that? Sure it's nice to try and cheer someone up, but the bottom line is, Jane's body was failing her, it was time to go.I'm sure Seth was there the second she became spirit."
1," Not bad, but needs something.: When 'Exit, Stage Left' came out, I was hoping for a good sequel to All The World's A Stage. I was kinda let down when I played the album, as it lacked the creativity and vibe of ATWAS. Maybe it's the fadeout between songs, maybe it's the lack of photo creativity in the album insert (album cover, if like me you purchased the 2-LP version when it was released). There are three photos in the cover, one of each member of the band, and they are not well-taken pictures. In the CD release, those same pictures are reversed - I was pretty sure Alex was not a left-handed guitarist.Nevertheless, the compilation of songs is very nice, and the addition of 'Broon's Bane' is a goodie, a nice touch to introducing 'The Trees.' It is also a treat to hear how 'Closer To the Heart' changes from live album to live album (starting with this release of course). Even with my opinion on it's short-comings, I see this album as a nice closure for the second chapter of Rush. Buy it."
1," An Alaskan Hero: Frank Glaser's story is a real, first hand look at Alaska in the early days. If you love Alaska and the wilderness, this is the book for you. Frank goes into the back-country and his adventures never cease as he traps, hunts, builds, explores and generally just checks things out. It amazes me that he is always so at ease, even in the most difficult of situations. He is the kind of guy you would just love to tag along with (if you could keep up with him!) His stories and accounts bring Alaska to life at a time when few tourists ventured into the back country. Jim Rearden has done a great job in compiling Frank's stories and amazing life. This book has given me a much greater appreciation of a great state...Wonderful Alaska! I doubt if anyone has ever experienced it like Frank Glaser."
1, GE Cordless Phone: The unit was ordered to provide a LOW COST phone for the garage. I have had the phone for less than 30 days. It is an excellent LOW COST unit. Shipping was prompt and arrival was on time. I would buy the unit again.
1, So romantic!: I love this because it is so easy to get involved in it. It always makes me wonder what I would choose if this ever happened to me.
1," Useful: I found this book very useful, some if it is quite basic but overall it explains some useful tips regarding email etiquette which may not be obvious to everyone."
1," an interesting book about an interesting ideal: this was a very intriguing book based on, what i have been told, a series of short films directed by the author. i have not watched the films, but if they are as good as this book makes them out to be, i really would like to watch them. i would recommend this book to anyone interested in an interesting concept, such as basing films on the ten commandments, and probably anyone who enjoyed the films would enjoy this book as well."
0," Stockman worships Bono: I love my Christian faith and I love U2, and have long wanted a book of this nature to be written, but it wasn't worth my time. The title would more aptly be The Spiritual Movement of Bono, who Steve Stockman all but deifies, writing from a standpoint that he could do no wrong and has always epitomized the Christian life and calling. I am highly impressed with U2's spirituality, but this book is so obviously biased in their favor that it makes everything in it obsolete. Stockman's long preaching tangents made me groan; I can read sermons elsewhere. Additionally, a book of this nature needs to be written in collaboration with the band. I admire Stockman's effort, but someone outside the U2 camp and so ridiculously venerating them can't be the author."
1," The Undisputed Best: Absolutely the best CCNA 2 study book. Closely follows Cisco's actual courseware. Was so superior to the other CCNA books I bought, I ended up not using the others. I passed 640-507 by a big margin."
0," Time to take a stand...: I haven't bought this game, and i realize that's a problem for some, but i will NOT be buying this game or any other game on the computer until DRM in its current incarnation is done away with.It's time to remind EA and all the other companies that choose to use this type of programming, that we are legitimate customers and would like to be able to play a game without corporate malware being installed.Thanks everyone out there for finally saying ""enough is enough"""
1," PLEASE re-release T,M,D!: This was a wonderful film! I agree with all the other comments, and I'd really love to have a copy of it."
0, Couldnt handle it: I am a teacher that takes my work home with me almost every day and I really relied on this cart. However after about 2 months the bottom fell out due to my apparent over use of the cart. :(
1," noise level: The fan operation is very noisy - much noiser than previous fan of the same brand and model, which we had and enjoyed for years."
0," a bad chick flick: Like many a chick flick, the heterosexual couple at first hate each other and then fall in love. Tia C. has blonde hair meant to make her look white, but why the charade when you're a famous Asian-American actress. David Chavret has ironed-flat lips. Unlike George Michael, his 5 o'clock shadow looks nasty and haggard. This work was simply not enjoyable. The only plus is the brief male nudity in it. There are too many quality chick flicks to waste your time on this stinker."
0," Phil Athans should really stay away from writing: I feel sorry saying this, but I really hate this book. Athans has thrown out all the interesting parts of the story line and made the less-intereting ones even more boring. Almost all the NPCs are dull and vague. The only good ones die early in the book. The story is like the rambling of a madman who can't remember what he did just a few minutes ago. And finally, the descriptions are either unnecessarily long (the battle scenes usually) or depressingly short (anything worth describing is given one to three sentences).If you've got a fiver burning in your pocket, give it to your local bum. No need to waste it on this book."
1, Common Sense: We need another Thomas Paine right now. His words from the 18th century still fit for contemporary society.
1," The Quintessential JLP: Very often an artist will release an album that encapsulates the essentials of the artist's work. Think of the Eagles and ""Hotel California"", or ""Damn the Torpedoes"" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. For Jean-Luc Ponty, ""Civilized Evil"" is that album. Which means, of course, that if you buy only one JLP album, this is the one you should get.Ponty illustrates both his mastery of the Jazz Violin (Now there's something you don't see every day!), and every aspect of his techno-funk fusion style on this CD. And his style is varied, ranging from the hautingly beautiful and orchestral ""Forms of Life"" to the pure driving fusion of ""Peace Crusaders"" to the retro progressive Jazz sound of ""Happy Robots"".Buy this CD now, and, like me, you'll be listening to it with as much happiness 20 years later (My God, has it been THAT LONG!)."
1," Highly Recommend: After careful research and reading reviews, this scanner was the best option for the features and cost. It has proven to be a great purchase and I would recommend this scanner to others. Installation was effortless. With Windows 7, we had to download the driver from the Epson website before installing the software and we have not had any problems at all. Nice, clean and straight scans. ADF has not jammed at all. Haven't scanned any pictures so I can't comment on that area. Overall, we love the scanner in our office and have not had any problems."
0," Junk. Leaks water, AGAIN: This is the second time this coffee maker has failed, and of course there is no way to send it back to Amazon.com. Second failure within the year warranty. Buy a Mr. Coffee. JUNK, JUNK. Please don't waste your money on this product that is sure to fail."
0," Time to regroup fellas...: Since this was Betts last outing with the band, he doesn't seem to be in sync with Trucks and therein lies one of many problems with this disc. As far as the songset goes, it's darn near perfect, with some of the old classics revisited(this should have been the case with the 1st and lousy 2nd set cd's but wasn't)but 'High Falls' just drags on way longer than it should have, 'Whipping Post' would have been a better choice. The band sounds tired and unrehearsed and Gregg's vocal are bit raw, maybe the end of the tour? Clearly Betts and Trucks are not a good match: sour notes, sloppy playing, etc. Basically a nice try but no cigar, maybe next time it will be better."
0," Sum 41 is plague upon all music.......: This album wouldn't irritate quite as much as it does now if it didn't seem like everybody but me enjoyes it. Not only are they unoriginal, the lyrics and versitality have reached an all time low. Sum 41 sings to pleasant pop tunes that they like making fun of people, they don't want to wake up, they have no motivation, and they are mad at their parents for making them do homework.This is good music for all the early teenagers who are in ""rebellion"" against their parents...Furthermore this album is about 40 minutes long.....all the songs sound the same and the longest song is 3:02 minutes and there is nary a guitar solo in the entire Cd. Oh Well....I'm sure that they will fade into obscurity within the decade.Anyways...I'm not a complete pop-punk hater...the self titled Blink 182 album wasn't that bad."
1," Good little sharpener!: It has been a cold and snowy winter this year in Ohio ... and there seems to be plenty of hardwood to go around. This convenient little sharpener does the trick ... and it is very light in weight and ""portable"". So far so good ... and it keeps on sharpening - hour after hour!Worth the price!"
0, Flawed Design: Unfortunately these are flawed. They have a strong binding neck the prevents the user from pulling back the wires so that the video and audio can be stretched apart. This is a problem since many setups have an audio receiver and a tv input more the just a foot apart.
0," Too loud: I ordered this chickadee thinking that it would have the ""chicka-dee-dee-dee-dee"" sound. I was disappointed to hear the two two-toned sound only. And it is very loud."
0," Why buy what you can get for free...: Go to: http://www.picasa.com/google/and you can get this for free, its now a part of google, why spend 25 bucks?"
0," Put the book down now!: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Pretty much, the entire book consists of Tristan raping Bettina, Bettina telling Tristan she hates him . . . again and again and again, until suddenly Bettina realizes that she loves Tristan. (Because, you know, if you rape a woman enough, she'll eventually learn to enjoy it and then fall in love with you.) To top it all off, over the months that Bettina is being raped by Tristan, her mother tries to convice her to love him. Ewww? I want my $7.99 back."
1," My Great Escape: Wow ! Gotta be just simply the best ! Freddy has & will always be tops. His lastest ""My Great Escape"" has surpassed them all. I enjoy the duets with Merle. The title song, My Great Escape, written by Big & Rich is a special favorite of mine. Can't say enough about this MUST HAVE addition to your collection."
0," OUCH!: Deborah Gibson is a talented rock star. With a good musical director, she has proved herself to be a wonderful musical theatre performer. This album, however, is a very uneasy marriage of the two genres. She sings every showtune on the album as if it's a pop tune with horrendous bubble gum arrangements. I have seen Miss Gibson in two musicals and have heard her sing showtunes live on other occasions- she knows how to sing showtunes. On this album, however, she's trying to pander to her pop audience and in the process, she created an album that fails as a pop album and as a showtune album. I can only hope that Miss Gibson finds a better musical director the next time she decides to record showtunes."
0," Great idea if it would work: Absolute bust. I thought this to be great for a kids party, but it just did not work. The kids gave up after 5 minutes. The ball is to heavy to be kicked, and rolling otherwise was only fun for a few minutes - not enough for ice cream to form. Taken that I can make ice cream using in just 2 plastic bags - this tool is worthless. I did not even bother cleaning it, it went right into the trash"
1," Good Shipping, but not what I thought.: I thought I was getting the 2nd edition, but this is the first. It did arrive quickly and was in good shape. Unfortunately, not the book I need."
1," The kid should have gotten an Oscar: Not much I can say except WOW! Exceptionally intelligent, exciting, touching film marked by wonderful acting by Osment. Utterly covincing, and even for a jaded movie-goer like me (I pride myself on smelling a ""twist"" in a story from a mile away), the ending of this movie had my jaw flapping in the wind. Thoroughly entertaining, masterful story-telling by Shyamalan. I recommend all to watch this film, even if you're deathly afraid of thrillers and ghost-stories like I am. Well worth the chills!"
0," research more: Two issues with these visors. First they arrived cracked. The external packaging was good, so wonder if they were shipped out already cracked.Second, the way these would install is directly onto the paint of the vehicle. Most visors go into the window well, which is what I was expecting. I wouldn't want to take the chance they would catch in a car wash and pry off the paint.I will continue to research better alternatives. These were the least expensive and the price comparable to my other vehicle visors, but do not install the same."
0," League of Gentlemen Series 2: We thoroughly enjoyed the first season of League of Gentlemen, but the second series (or season) fell short. The same characters and same locations were used, but the writing wasn't as clever as in the first season. We don't know if we'll purchase the third season at this point."
0, Out of date very inaccurate: This book is worthless now. The chspter on Southwestern is very misleadinhg and not good advice in picking a school. The prgressive regime of President Shilling has beem replaced by a minister bringing to an end the transformation. With large loss in the endowment in 2000 they are having a hard time doing anything innovative. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THR REST BUT IF THIS IS INDICATIVE DO NOT BUY OR USE THIS BOOK.
1," Masterpiece: This is one of the most awesome jazz albums that I own. The two different quartets that back Ornette Coleman give this album an awesome, raw feel. The solos from Ornette's saxaphone are crazy, but terrfic at the same time. This is impromptu, free jazz at its best. Fans of the free jazz style must buy this album."
0," By far the worst book I've read: It is difficult to know where to start. The story? It's a reused plot line, nothing that hasn't been done before and not even a good choce for reuse - an older man manipulated by a young woman. Snore. The writing - pretty poor. The author, if this is a good example of his writing, needs to go back and start over. The ending? UghI don't understand why the ending was a shock to anyone. So Erica manipulates Richard once again. That's a surprise? I started skimming about half way through just to get to the end to see what the big twist was only to be disappointed again.Don't waste your time or money on this book. It's a stinker. I agree with the reviewer that comparisons to Grisham should be for contrast because this author's work doesn't compare favorably at all."
0," poor quality: My son has worn Levi 569 jeans for years. I purchased three pairs for him a few months ago. He's only worn them a few times and the belt loop by the label has ripped off on all three pairs!! He also told me that they are very tight in the crotch area like several of you have mentioned here. I'm so disappointed, we are going to have to look for another pair of comfortable jeans."
1," Great video game adaptation, and enjoyable in its own right.: On its own, it's a pretty good fantasy action film, if a little hokey at times. But what makes this film stand out is that it is still one of the best adaptations of a video game to film. It stays (mostly) true to the story of the first Mortal Kombat game -- I bet you didn't know they have a story! -- and is still an enjoyable movie. Probably its biggest departure from the games is the utter absence of blood and gore, and it never feels the worse for it.Word to the wise: even if you like this movie and all the video games, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THE SEQUEL!"
0," It's a Book About Veganism: This book is not about dieting or being skinny, it's about veganism...period...the end. The book offers no other altneratives. They should name it ""How to Be a Vegan"" or ""Good Meal Suggestions for Vegan Eating"". This book goes beyond vegetarianism and shuns milk, eggs, yogurt, cheese, etc.If you don't like being yelled out (there is a lot of that in this book), and you are not interested in being a vegan, then don't get this book.I should have read more into the title, but I thought the name was just a marketing ploy to get more attention. It's not. Almost the entire book is a rant w/ some source material referenced to support the author's rant.On the plus side, for those interested in veganism, this book offers many pages of vegan product suggestions."
1, this pay per view is great: 1st match randy orton vs rvd winner rvd. 2nd match the sandman tommy dreamer and cm punk vs eijah burke marcus cor von and matt stricker winners sandman tommy dreamer and cm punk. 3rd match the hardys vs the world's greatest tag team winners hardys. 4th match kane vs mark henery winner mark henery. 5th match vince mchamon vs bobby lashley winner bobby lashley. 6th match candice mchelle vs melina winner candice mchelle. 7th match edge vs batista winner edge. 8th match jhon cena vs the great khali winner jhon cena.
1, The Prince in Disguse: The book Beast is a very good book. Most people that read will understand the meaning of the book since it is similar to the story Beauty and the Beast. This story is about a prince who is cursed by a fairy and turn into a lion(beast). The beast is the prince of Persian. When he was turn into a beast he ran off into the forest. On that day he knew that his father was hunting in the forest. So he tried every thing to avoid his father. The only way to break the ancient curse is by a French beauty named Belle. If you want to find out if the prince is ever release from the curse. Then I would recommend you to read this book.
1, Great action movie.: What else do you expect from Frankenheimer? It was definitly his movie. He did a great job and it was definitly worth seeing. I will buy it as soon as the price drops (the price is so high due to the rental community) it will drop soon. I would suggest everyone at least renting it to see Frankenheimer do his work.
0, HORRIBLE!!: This is horrible! Based on this recording of the original cast I can't believe it lasted long enough to make it to the U.S. where we made it a hit.The vocalists aren't singers and have a serious pitch problem. The Roxy cast with it's 1st. rate singers make you appreciate the rockin' melodies in ROCKY but here the melodies aren't pronounced.Richard O'Brian the author of the work doesn't even do justice to his own songs! The Riff-Raff in the Roxy version really lets it rip and should've done the movie version also. Pass on this one and get the Roxy cast of L.A. or even the new Broadway Revival version.
1, Cooking: Great cook book .... Love the illistrations Book arrived in great conditionand this is the only way to buy. Cookbook covers every type of cooking fromdesserts to salads to main course.
1, Love the Power Thought Cards: I recently bought the Power Thought Cards to share with my yoga classes. Before each class I hand out a card to each participant and during the first few minutes of class each person takes a moment to reflect and meditate on the positive thoughts!
1," KFC is back!: Buckethead, Monsters and Robot, is a must get CD. A little bit of Korn and whole lot of Primus. The talent is great the music is great. That is all I have to say. If you are going to buy 3 discs in the next day or 2 make Make it this; Buckethead, Monsters and Robots; Staind, Dysfunction; and my fav: Wisconsin Death trip by Static-X, the best band ever!"
0," Bad buy: I received the product quickly, but it is true that the material is reviewed one hundred percent, the discs were dirty, one of the disks did not work and the box was broken."
0," Do not waste your money: Almodovar style, a lot of none sense with a stupid end. Couple disgusting scenes and a lot of cursing. It leaves me the impression that Mexican producers exploit young girl's sexuality just to satisfy their own inner passions."
1," absolutely fabulous for the absolute beginner: This is the book to get if you know nothing about web sites. It is clearly organized, tons of helpful pictures and easy to follow directions. Before I got this book, I couldn't figure out what to do first. This book help me turn my web site on fast and far easier than I ever imagined. Buy it!"
1," Very much worth watching: Funny movie, though not the best cop movie ever made. I laughed at this as much as I did at ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" -- mostly because it's just as absurd and takes itself just as seriously. What I liked best is it's hands-on instruction on how to curse the Quebecois way, and the ""hockey mascot in the bathroom"" scene-- which could be one of the funniest scenes ever. The movie is worth watching just for this."
1, Couldn't put it down!: The reputation of this novel to steal your attention is well deserved. What a thriller although it may well upset some who believe it to be blasphemous.
1," Excellent novel debut: If it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, somebody needs to tell that to Portia because she definitely had her tools ready. I enjoyed this novel page by page."
1," Beyond a flat wall: This is a fascinating book that brings to life the evidence that is not only clear but fairly undeniable. One only has to look at the prophecy in Ezekial 38 and 39 to see that God certainly uses the ""weather"" to shake things up and put an end to anti-semitic/anti-Israeli behavior. It is very easy for a third or fourth party to say to someone 'give your land up to your certain enemy', especially when the third party has no vested interest. The blessed hope in the Faith and in this book is that one doesn't have to be a certain type of scholar to comprehend basic truth. They must simply look beyond a flat wall and see a vision of detailed structure. This book makes that very easy to accomplish."
1, I thought it was an excellent book!: I thought the book The Incredible Journey was excellent! I think the book can teach kids things like teamwork and never give up on what you believe in. When the animals felt that they had to give up they did not because they knew they had to try to do what they needed to do. I know I liked the book and I hope whoever reads the book likes it to. (3)
1," A superior book on labor, ethnicity, and politics: A well-researched and original book describing the shifting allegiances of Chicago workers from ethnic help societies to their welfare capitalist employers to finally the US government. In addition to the subject of the growing labor movement, the book is also a great survey of the various ethnic/racial groups of 1920s Chicago and their differing experiences with Americanization.There is a book I would like to recommend as a virtual ""sequel"" to this one. The Origins of the Urban Crisis by Thomas Sugrue. While Cohen's book is about the creation of the New Deal coalition in the factory neighborhoods and towns of Chicago, Sugrue's book is about the disappearance of the factories and the departure from the Democratic coalition in the 1960s of the same groups who joined it in the 30s. Sugrue's book also won a Bancroft prize and if you like one you will surely like the other."
1," Unspoken of!: Unspoken&#8213;Bathsheba""Her beauty stirred the passion of a king. Her pain moved the heart of God.""Beauty she had, love...? Not so much. In one moment, her whole life was ruined after the summons of her king. Then the unthinkable happens.Bathsheba is thrust into mourning and a life she has only dreamed up. But is it truly what she wanted?Unspoken shows how a single mistake can change history. It teaches about forgiveness and how God can take the worse circumstances and use them for good."
0," Not well written, very predictable: I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed by The Pilot's Wife. It was not particularly well written (I was ready to scream with her ""he said, she said"") and the story was all too predictable.I am very surprised that Oprah and Amazon recommended this mediocre book"
1," Great option for a do-it-yourself security system: This is a great option for a do-it-yourself security system with a built in alarm to deter burglars. No need for ongoing contract as the system call automatically calls your cell phone or neighbour if triggered. Easy to install, but would highly recommend buying a signal repeater to increase reliability. The system seems to take some time to learn where the sensors are when the main unit is moved."
0," Contrived Pathos: I gave it one star because it was a quick read, thank goodness. I would hate to think I invested any more time reading something so disappointing. Not 10 pages into the book and I already knew where this was headed. It's not believeable that a mother would write to her son in this fashion without the obvious being so obvious. It's hackneyed, haggared, and horrible. I want my money back!"
1," Could have been written today: For a book that was first published in 1848 France, it is completely applicable to 2011 USA.Bastiat's main point is that Socialism is Legalized Plunder and False Philanthropy. Plain and simple."
1," Essential for the Django fan: This is the closest thing that we have to a ""farewell"" album from Django, and just the smallest peak at where he may have been headed. Although by this point he was mesmerized by bop and the new sounds coming out of America, his fans and comrades had come to consider him part of the old school of Euro jazz. Django probably decided he would have to inch his way over to the new sounds and seems to do so on many of these recordings. His electric guitar playing can be thrilling and unusual - he was already experimenting a tiny bit with distortion and harmonics - and you can hear him trying to pull the other musicians into the great beyond with him. This collection nicely wraps up the studio work from some of his final sessions and is nicely mastered and annotated. Not exactly on par with the gold standard JSP series of Django's work, but still very worthwhile."
0," Elastic Band makes it unwearable: Title says it all. The hat is the right size, but the elastic band chokes my dog and makes it unwearable, even on its biggest setting. Terrible."
1," Enjoyable reading: I liked the book, I couldn't put it down. It was funny, sexy,romantic and you find yourself caught up in the story. I definitely recommend this book."
1," Refresh Your Soul: I received the book as a present and really enjoyed reading it. I've never written about a book before, but I think this one deserves five stars. This fabulous book is packed with wonderful wisdom. The author shares a series of interesting life stories that are enjoyable and convey a deep truth about the human experience. His writing leaves you renewed and inspired, providing a new perspective about the events and people that shape our lives. The main elements are the ten Paradoxical Commandments themselves. They combine to form a positive message about life and the human spirit. This enriching message frees you to be yourself, and give the world the best you have. The Commandments are so powerful that for years they have circled the entire globe, continually passed from person to person. Now, the original author takes you on his path of discovery. I urge you to read this book; it will refresh your soul."
1," Pearl's Secret: This was not only an interesting story, but it was eye opening for me having grown up in a small rurual town in the mid-west, I had no idea that blacks suffered such blatant racism in the 50s and 60s."
0," Don't Waste Your Time: This may well have been the worst book I ever read. The premise is interesting, and it could have been a great book, but Fowler's writing style is obnoxious. Her incorrect overuse of commas makes the book difficult to read. Her third person/first person game is annoying as well. Did anyone edit this book? The authors who attached their names to the blurbs must have owed Fowler a favor. Quite often the publisher writes the blurbs, and the author's select the one to which their name will be attached. They may have not even read the book, just a synopsis. I think the publisher and the author knew that a book with Jane Austen in the title would sell, and they didn't care much about the quality of the book."
1," Best Album: Dean in my eyes has always been the better performer out of the rat pack. I still don't understand why they let Peter Lawford in, it had to of been the Kennedy lure. This is a great CD and has all the best songs by Dean Martin, it is one on my favorites. I highly recommend this CD."
0," Well, they seemed good...: I bought these knives about 1 month ago, and initially loved them. They were a great set for the price -- the knives were very sharp and sturdy. Just this past week, however, I noticed that a couple of the knives had developed rust! Obviously, this shouldn't be happening to high-carbon stainless steel knives. I will be sending these back!"
0," Save your money...: This book is an exercise in mediocrity. This man just trolled through websites of organizations and pasted the contents therein into his manuscript.It is a shame that someone would add his name to this kind of work, but then again Ross values and the Ross name are different from my values and my name.My advice to all who are interested in this book: save your mone, you can get the exact same info of the internet at no cost to you."
1," #4 on my Top Ten List: This CD has everything you could possibly need or want. I have a copy at work, in the car and at home, and everyone I've given it to adores it. I just wish I had heard it while they were together, so I could have seen them live!"
0," HEY PETER CULLEN ! WHERE ARE YOU ?: This second release of an articulately-detailed G1 Optimus Prime is third rate. It appears to be using the same mold as the almost all-metal version that came out a couple of years ago, HOWEVER, this new model is more plastic than metal. My biggest gripe about this item is the statement on the box that says ""Real Movie Sounds"". That awful base that comes with this toy, which supposedly has lights and sounds from the Animated Motion Picture (1986), does not have actual dialogue from the movie. Peter Cullen's portrayal of the ORIGINAL PRIME is not heard in this base. The only authentic sounds coming from the base are the original 'transforming' sound effects from the G1 shows and the animated movie. Basically, I wouldn't buy this item if it were FREE. Does HASBRO think the buying public is ignorant of the fact that the voice is not the original Prime? I personally feel insulted by this product."
0," Inertia couldn't be much worse: Wow. I can't believe that anybody could find something positive to say about this video. Out of the dozens of climbing videos I've seen, this is close to the worst. The footage is terrible, and clips are often repeated three or four times during the video to make it seem longer. I know retail stores that struggle with this video since multiple customers try to return it, aghast at the absurdity of charging money for such boyish dabbling in video. You want a good video? Buy ""The Real Thing,"" ""Free Hueco,"" or ANYTHING but this!"
0," boring for my toddler: I bought this for my nearly 2 yr old son who loves trains big and small. He loves the Thomas the Tank Engine series and loves to see the train in the Baby Einstein ""On the Go"" DVD, but this was a total let down. He wasn't interested at all and no wonder. It is too much standing around and talking. I tried to keep the whole tape on fast forward but even then it was dull---particularly this endlessly long segment where Harry is seated in the dining car with two school aged children-- and that's it! How is that interesting? To a child who doesn't understand conversations, the banter is not entertainment. To a parent who does understand the conversations, it is pure mindless torture. I've never given anything such a poor review. I won't even bother describing more of the same with the helicopter segment. This DVD is in need of major editing if it is to appeal to little tikes."
1," Simplicity and quality in a tiny unit: Good price, great sound quality, and an easy unit to figure out even if you've never before owned an Apple product. Yes it (and iTunes) will work fine if you have a Windows PC. Some of us don't have ""thousands of CDs"" or favorite songs, so if your favorite songs number more in the dozens (up to 250 in the 1GB shuffle) then this is an excellent choice. Also, it's good for younger kids, who tend to lose things. You won't go beserk if a $70 product disappears as you might if it was bye-bye video Nano. The only disadvantage may be that this product encourages introverted behavior--but as one of the people in the world with a distant expression and white earplugs attached to head, I now think sometimes that is a nice place to be."
0," Shame on Amazon for rising the price....!!!!: I use to buy my pampers here on amazon, but since they have raised the price to over $3 per package in the last month, I will be getting mine from Wal-Mart, shame on Amazon for rising the price. At least they are cheaper at Wal-Mart and I can use my manufacturer coupon at Wal-Mart. Perhaps if Amazon would lower the price again, I would shop from Amazon again... SHAME ON AMAZON!!! LOWER THE PRICE!!!"
0," Waste of money: I bought the Celestron Skycout on Amazon. It was off kilter, as others have reviewed. It would identify objcts a few degrees to the right of where I pointed the lens (that doesn't magnify). That makes it a real problem to identify stars among clusters. I wrote the company twice about returning it or getting it calibrated, with no response. Still getting their promo emails though.So it's just a piece of junk in my closet that I can't seem to throw away because it cost almost $200. I had plans to buy a Celestron telescope with it, but obviously not now. Anyway, I bought the little speaker, which doesn't connect well and always falls off, and I was able to use it in the ""general direction"" of the star I heard described - a few minutes about the composition of the star and related mythology and a little history at times. It's interesting, but a bit gimmicky. My Android app can use GPS to identify stars. I'd rather just use that and a good telescope."
0," Interesting, outdated, will lead many down the wrong path: While the whole of the Arnold mythology is an interesting subject, as a training reference this book is questionable. The more I learn about lifting, the less I like this book. Arnold's success came from fabulous genetics, hard work, supreme self-confidence, steroids, and the behind-the-scenes assistance of Joe Weider. It wasn't from the two-hour workouts and ""sculpting"" exercises found in the first edition of this book. Some of the exercise advice he gives out - and just about anyone else ever associated with Joe Weider - has misled the entire community of body building wanna-bees for a generation."
1," Even I could do it.: I loved the photos and patterns in this book and although I'm not a very expirienced knittter, I just had to try one of the baby cardigan patterns. With great determination I proceeded to work it, and yes, the pattern is actually simple, but I had to go on line to clarify terms and procedures, thank goodness for youTube videos which explained them. Most of the time, and practically till the end I was guessing how it was going to all work out since there are not drawings of the pattern or clear explanations of what seemed more like a puzzle than anything else. However it worked out and I ended up loving the project and how it turned out. So, be prepare to perssist if you're not very experienced, but it is worth it."
1," The best rock band and song ever made: Europe are a powerful rock band indeed. The title song, 'The final countdown is one of the most moving and dramatic songs ever made. Their album is a powerpack of raw rock energy and with Joey Tempest's strong vocals, who could resist the great band that is Europe"
0," Faking it: This is a really bad book. It applies a few generic psychoanalytic insights to everything, borrows heavily from Zizek in places, especially in its reflections on Judaism, without anywhere acknowledging the debt, and the ""wry wit"" is not that witty at all, but indulgent and infinitely self-regarding. The relation between Faking It's clever cover and its preening, self-pleasuring insides is one of pure, authentic fakery."
1," ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER: Why is this album is at 3.5 stars? This CD puts 11 of the best rap/rock mixture together and its all done collectively by Tommy Lee and Tilo. Just look at who all helped on this album, George Clinton, Lil Kim, Snoop, Fred Durst, Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys, the Filthee Immigrants, Scott Kirland, Kid Rock, and U-Dogg from the WU Tang. For all of you out there you gave it anything below a 3 or 4 you all can just listen to track 6 or go back to listing to Britney Spears, the choice is yours."
1," Steph, Southwest Philly: THIS BOOK WAS A PAGE TURNER. WELL WRITTEN.....I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN......VERY GOOD STORY LINE"
1," Beaches is still amazing!: I bought this on DVD since my VHS version is almost completely worn out. My roommate had never seen it, so I wanted her to see it without all the lines from my old tape. Still love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it."
1," Great Relaxing Movies!!!: The movies had great dancing scenes, was easy to follow, and the music tracks are famous."
1," It is amazing.: I have to agree with everyone else that this is a mind-shattering CD! India Arie not only has an amazing, awe-inspiring voice, but deep lyrics and beautiful music to accompany it. The title of the CD describes it all: Acoustic Soul. Listen to the samples and you will be hooked."
1," Pleasantly Surprised: I purchased this book two months ago and did not pick it up to read until two days agao. Needless to say, I have already finished it. I truly did not think I would enjoy the subject matter; I'm not one for circuses, but I LOVED this book. I could not put it down once I started it. I grew so attached to Jacob, Rosie, Walter, Camel, Marlena, even Bobo the chimp and I had to see their fate. The characters made me laugh, cry and really FEEL. Sara Gruen does an outstanding job in giving her characters real depth, even the elephant.My only complaint was the torture of the animals. It was very difficult to read of the abuse, but I know that is an accurate desciption of circus life. Hopefully the abuse is not as bad not as it was then."
0, Lame nyc map: don't waste your money. just because its laminated doesn't make it a good map. Not all streets are on it and sections of manhattan are missing. I wouldn't count on this map to help you out if you don't know the area and have things memorized before you get here. WE got lost on more than one occasion trying to use this thing.Get the NFT black book of nyc instead. It has all you need and is small enough to fit into your purse or pocket.
0," drum sander: I put this sander in my rotary grinder and the first thing it did was bend the soft shaft and smack my hand several times. Out of balance is something I can deal with, but this shaft is too soft and is dangerous."
1," Beautiful, great quality -- very attractive for babies! :): As soon as i put this cloth book in front of my 2 months old baby girl she was amazed by it!! :) it was so cute to see her watching the pages with lots of interest and she was so happy i'm glad i bought this for her.. :) totally recommended"
1," Really liked it: This book was a pleasant surprise although as stated before there were a few historical discrepancies (not enough to annoy me personally, but enough to notice). I thought the interpersonal relationships she had with all the royals made the characters seem more real and fulfilled my visions of what they should be. I preferred this portrayal of Anne better than Gergorys' The Other Boleyn Girl which made her seem evil."
0, For the new player only: I am a new player and even I can tell that this book is not worth your time nor money. The background generator and the list of names are the only items of value. Most of the text is fluff and not useful to the newest of players (a.k.a. me). I was shocked when I saw how thin this book is.
0," ""Worst Game ever"": To quote one of my favorite simpsons characters, the comic book guy, this is the worst game ever. I was at the store and I only had .... I had heard of Rune on PC and it looked pretty cool. I saw it on the shelf and it was only ...I should have known that a PS2 game that is under ... is probably going to ... hard but, i bought it anyway. worst mistake of my life. THE GRAPHICS ARE LIKE SOME OF THE EARLIER RELISES ON PS1!!!! the controlls are allright. THERE ISNT A REAL STORY. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET FAR BECAUSE IT IS SO BORING TO EVEN WANT TO PLAY IT. when I look at my shelf of games the ones that pop out at me and scream ""PLAY ME I AM FUN"" are FFX (which is the best in the final fantasy series so far), GTA 3, Tony hawk 3, and metal gear solid 2. But little old rune is seperated from the rest. Its in the back collecting dust. I think im going to go spit on it right now. In conclusion: whoever gave this game over 1 star is insane. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
0," great fondue terrible stir fry: I have to agree with the first review. We actually made a fondue first and it worked so well that I could not wait to try a stir fry... What a disappointment: it does not eat enough and the food steams slowly, very slowly..."
1, I use these every day to care for my newborn: I love these cloth diapers. I use them everyday to care for my newborn. I mostly use them as burp cloths and as extra protection for the changing pad during diaper changes. They wash up great. I would highly recommend these cloth diapers.
0," Virg: They Just make the diposal smell clean thats it, I was looking for something to clean it. Don't waste your money, Buy disposal Care does exactly what you pay for."
1, Quality to the max: This is a pretty raw album as far as Blink goes. Ramones 3 chord style. It has nice short songs and plenty of energy. A very nice version of carousel with a long intro. 21 Days is an amazing song too. This isn't a very useful review is it? I think I'll stop. Good album
0," Week: Very week, not good at all. It is almost static, no movement at all.I do not recommend it.Sandra"
0," Limited Growth: The game provides no growth as far as building buildings or upgrading your armies. You can play each civ once and be bored. The way you use each civ is the same, they do not have unique attributes beyond naming the armies and buildings something different. I guess if I never was to play an rts I would like it, but since i have games like Rise of Nations, etc. to compare it against it falls very short. If you like lord of the rings and have bought all of the other games, then by all means go out and buy this one, but if you like a good rts this is not one of them. BTW: One resource to collect, and about 8 units to build, it even sounds boring:)"
1, Great watering can: Great watering can. Decent cans are getting hard to find in stores thank goodness for the internet.The way the spout folds is great for storage
1, It Works As Advertised: We've had our Uniden phones in operation for almost a month and are very happy with their performance. A neat feature is the alternative rings that can be used for different callers. Setup was easy and we have had no problems with the phones as of this writing. We also have an older model Uniden that we've had for about three years with no problems. I'd recommend this company's products unhesitatingly.
1," Good one: I studied only from this book including taking practice tests and passed the bilogy with 63. The book gives good material on the topics, arranged systematically and writen in detail. I would completely recommend it."
0, NexxTECH DVD 16X - Junk - Junk - JUNK: I bought these DVD's at Circuit City and what a mistake. My Advice: Don't buy them!!!NDVD1650P NexxTech - 50 x DVD+R - 4.7 GB (120min) 16x - spindle - storage media
0," waste of money: These bottles are impossible. We spent so much money on purchasing numerous VentAire bottles in various sizes. After just 10 days, we could no longer take the leaking bottoms and need to let air in, so that our daughter could get anything out. We gave them to charity and had to purchase an entire new line of bottles- Avent, MUCH BETTER!!!!"
0," Not very insightful: I have typically been a fan of Doreen Virtue. I love her cards and own and recommend several of her books. However, this book I found to be a huge disappointment. If you are looking for the message that is repeated in just about every number sequence - basically, ""the angels believe in you and want you to have faith, call on them for help"" then this is for you. If you are interested in something deeper than that, you can find just about any numerology book out there and it will go into depth about numbers and their meanings. For a really accurate and insightful book, I highly recommend ""The Life Your Were Born To Live"" by Dan Millman."
1, Maisie Dobb Mysteries: This is a well crafted book. A very pleasant read. I look forward to reading more of the series to see where it sends her.
1," A nice introduction to America's ""hidden"" history: Although I agree with the other individuals that have reviewed this book (that many parts seemed very unfeasible) overall it was an excellent introduction to American History. Having been entirely educated in the American school system - we barely glazed over the US treatment of Japanese during the war. I had no idea until I read this book the extent of the mistreatment and injustice that Japanese immigrants and citizens of Japanese decent were subject to during the war. As a story, this book is fabulous, as a tool for education it is a start. Today's youth will pick this up out of interest and they will learn something new. Of course if they want more accurate facts they will have to try the dryer literary works in the history section!! But, at least they will learn a little more about where our country has been and what we have done to our own citizens."
1," Party in a Cookbook: For those of you that loved the Silver Palate or Back to Basics cookbooks, Celebrate is written by Sheila Lukins who co-wrote both of those cookbooks.This is a super fun cookbook that's organized by holiday - everything from Academy Award's night to Greek Easter to Celebrate a Promotion. In addition to the recipes - she includes music, drinks and ""extras"" for each event- punch bowl, BBQ grill, soup tureen. Lukens has also written some really nice openings for each section so it's not only a great cookbook, it's fun to read too.Highly recommend - great recipes and jumping point for some creative ideas for any type of event you may be hosting."
0," Not what it seems.: This book is actually a 31 page pamphlet rather than a paperback book. The information on making mustard is woefully short, the bulk of the book being rather pedestrian recipes for using mustard.The recipies remind me of the ones on that back of store packages. Most of them seem to have mustard included simply so the recipies can be included in this book."
1, Case for Canon SD-1000 with magnetic fastener: This product is a little expensive for what it is but it works well enough. Very simple operation - camera fits inside and it closes with a magnetic seal.
0," Farfetched and disappointing: Perhaps the screen play will be void of the lackluster plots Harris has used in this novel. I must admit that I was a true fan of the Silence of the Lambs piece and was expecting much more with Hannibal. For me, it was not near as appetizing!"
0," Oh, Please!: Normally I quite enjoy Marion Chesney's Regency romances. They often feature witty dialogue and absolutely hilarious secondary characters. This book features neither of these. Unfortunately, the heroine I found unsympathetic and the hero was quite dull. The only funny moments came from the little menagerie the heroine builds for herself, and those were few and far between. The overall tone of the story was lonely and disaffected. This isn't the best example of Chesney's work. To see her in much better form I would recommend any of the books in the School for Manners or Six Sisters series, which are all far superior to this one."
1," Should Be Required Reading for Everyone at some time...: After reading only a little of this book; I believe everyone should read ""Why Good People Do Bad Things"" by Erwin W. Lutzer at some time in their lives. Someone very important to me said they enjoyed the read & urged me to check it out. I thank & love him for that suggestion too. You can't get it new, at least I wasn't able to, but don't let that stop you. Get this book! You'll be glad you did & then share it."
0," Oprah has Lost All Credibility With Me!: I ordered this DVD following the second Oprah show featuring the subject. I missed the first show, but it sounded monumental. When the DVD arrived, I promptly put it in. Within minutes, I was feeling like a total fool, duped into buying something so ridiculous. The DVD is terrible!!! Lots of mysticism and focus on obtaining material wealth. It is very poorly put together.I fell asleep during the first watching, then made myself watch it a second time just to make sure I hadn't missed something that would change my life. Nope - 'fraid not.I leafed through the book version in a store recently and saw it contained some good quotes. If you have to purchase a version, I would take the book over the DVD. But honestly, they were both huge disapppointments. What was Oprah thinking to recommend such hogwash?"

0," Westclox 1068 Authentic 1964 Big Ben Classic Keywind Alarm Clock: Again, as with the ""Baby Ben"" I ordered, this one is JUNK OFTHE HIGHEST ORDER! I am SO disappointedwith both these so-called clocks! Alarm didn't work, and only ran a few minutes when wound.'Authentic? IDON'T THINK SO!"
1," Giddy About Gillian: Anyone who loves James Horner will fall in love with this soundtrack. The quite intimacy and warm setimentality are vintage Horner. Indeed, it would be safe to say that some of the exquisite motifs in this soundtrack--particularly the melodies played by the oboe in several tracks--are a prefiguring of the delicate themes Horner developed in Titanic."
0," Tiny and Tedious: I needed these letters for a simple project involving re-naming a few items on a panel. Though I needed the middle range of sizes (1/8""-3/16"") these were very difficult to use. I am a Long time hobbyer and practiced at many crafts; these letters were frustrating and too closely spaced for a reliable transfer without diturbing other letters. I was working with a magnified head set and an appropriate tool. Just touching the film would release some letters ruining them and further frustrating the transfer. Even after the letters are transfered; they are extremely fragile and must be sealed with clear or the like because a simple touch will remove a portion without a doubt. Good luck, they are needful but tedious as I have said."
0," Wasted potential: before i played the demo of this game,i thought it would be awesome,like a better version of rune from the ps2,but alas,i was sorely disapointed.I was looking forward to the fast paced action that made the movie gladiator exciting to watch but this game is turn based.Turn based!what were they thinking.I know there arent that many turn based games around so its a change of pace from the norm,but why on such a cool looking game?i was sorely disapointed."
1," Hilarious!: There is not one bad song on this hilarious CD. If you're a fan of the extremely funny SP antics, you will love this CD. Hysterical!!!!!!!"
0," Hanes Perfect Rag...: horrible T, after you wash and dry it.Cotton is soft...but shrinks horribly Awkward. Shrunk big time in the length but sleeves stayed big. My Kirkland (made by Hanes Tees) are way better and shrunk like expected. Don't buy these and don't trust the fit from the picture on the package. Thanks for the new cleaning rags. Rip-off"
1," Leslie West & Corky Laing: I had the pleasure of seeing LESLIE WEST many years ago at the BLUE ONION CLUB in NORMAN,OKLAHOMA. I own the LESLIE WEST/MOUNTAIN catalog on vinyl and CD. I bought this DVD and have watched it only once. LESLIE WEST AND MOUNTAIN rock the Mystic Club in Petaluma California. The scrapbook section with the story of MOUNTAIN'S fourth gig at WOODSTOCK, the story of FELIX PAPPALARDI and the story of MISSISSIPPI QUEEN add to the music included on this disc. The sound is excellent. The camera work is outstanding. Songs included on the DVD are BLOOD OF THE SUN, FOR YASGUR'S FARM, NEVER IN MY LIFE, THEME FROM AN IMAGINARY WESTERN and NANTUCKET SLEIGHRIDE along with CROSSROADS and some new songs from LESLIE WEST. CORKY LAING is one of rock's greatest drummers. Bass guitar is provided by RICHIE SCARLET and he is in excellent form. If you love LESLIE WEST AND MOUNTAIN you should buy this title as soon as possible."
0," Not Good: Set this thing up with fresh batteries over 3 weeks ago in a space where I've actually seen a mouse. Nothing. Got our handyman to check, changed batteries, bait - still nothing. Not worth the money. Never again."
1," The Magna Cart Personal Hand Truck is just what I needed.: I love this cart! It folds up to a compact, space saving size, it's easy to open it up. It is lightweight and easy for me to handle. I really like how the wheels fold in flat, too. I used the cart, loaded with plastic tubs full of craft fair items, for multiple trips in and out of a building."
1," love it: I read daily from this womens bible, and would recomend to all women who read the bible daily, enjoy it very much"
0," Save Your Money: Worthless. Classic example of qualified instructors transformed into talking heads in front of static images and even a dry erase board. Less than one quarter of the disk is devoted to actual sailing, and the shots are so poor and amateurish one cannot see the maneuvers being desperately described in confusing voice overs. Keep shopping."
0," Inaccurate Sources: Before holding this book as fact, you may want to look into the author's sources. Out of curiousity, I checked into a few of the references in the book. For instance, on page 23 of Chapter Two ""Let Them Eat Cake"", Bossie mentions that Kerry voted in 1999 to increase tobacco taxes by $133 billion to pay for prescription drug benefits. His reference, #41 of Chapter Two refers to S. Con. Res. 20. This resolution refers to investigations into the bombing of the Israeli Embassy and has nothing whatsoever to do with tobacco tax increases.Make sure you check a writer's sources before you take his written word for fact. I found several other such discrepencies in this book."
1," One of the best!: ""The Gold of Cape Girardeau"" is a wonderful story that successfully combines fiction with history. You fall in love with the characters and become unable to put the book down. It has an intriguing plot that mixes the past with modern day. You go back through time and become a part of Lindy's and John's world, laughing when they laugh, crying when they cry. It evokes all your emotions and touches your heart. It is truly one of the best!"
1," Fantastic!: As my five year old daughter expressed, ""I think this cd was excellent. Laurie Berkner has such fun songs. We like to sing and play, ""Im Gonna Catch You"" in the back yard. She has such a pretty voice and sings fun and beautiful songs!"" Our trips to the grocery store as well as extended car rides are much more enjoyable as we sing and dance to our new Laurie Berkner cd! As enjoyable for kids and parents alike!"
0, cheap: These glasses are very cheaply made and are so small that my three yr old can wear them. It is not worth paying the shipping to send them pack so as I said my three yr old now has a pair of glasses...
1," Still better than other brands we've tried.: The diapers work great. They have served us better than a number of other brands. The only issue I have is they are produced by Procter and Gamble who some claim abuse animals. I'm not sure if this is true though. Check out: www.pandgkills.com If it is truthful, I would have to withdraw my 5 star rating."
1," a worthwhile read: Crow Lake was a book everyone was talking about so finally I got it and read it, and I wished I had not waited so long. This is a beautifully written book about family, loss, and love. The heartbreaking story of four children left on their own after their parents die is interwoven with the reminiscences of the older daughter, Kate, after she has grown up, moved from her Northern Ontario home, and become a professor.Far from wanting to ""slap"" the protagonist for her emotional coldness (as one reviewer suggests), I could really empathize with how the grief and lost dreams of Kate's past have affected her and how long it takes for her to make peace with things her brothers have dealt with long ago. Lawson understands that life crises actually do hurt and traumatize people--yet they can still heal and find peace even if their childhood ideals are not realized, and even if that resolution takes time.I found this book quite inspiring and written with real grace and simplicity."
1," Mass Effect: Good game, caught on to it late. But really looking forward to finishing it and moving on the ME2 before the next installment is released."
1, do not buy from this web site- It is way overpriced: Do not buy this product for $69 on this site. You are overpaying by $50.00. I paid $20.00 at Target and Walmart is the same price. Amazon should look at prices at other stores for a price comparison. This is a substantional price difference. It is a good product. but do not overpay for it.
0," Did not meet any expectations: Made ice for about a week and then it started to make smaller and smaller cubes and they never really froze. When it stopped completely after two weeks the owners manual said to send it to a ""qualified technician"" No numbers to call not even for the New Air Company. I sent it back immediately."
0," the book is a lot better: i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring, i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever read"
1," NO ONE CAN TOUCH THIS GUY!: elvis changed music forever in every sense and these great performances prove that. people always seem to forget how great a singer elvis really was. he had an incredible range and an incredible range in styles, whether it was rock, country or gospel. you get all that here. i just wish they would have included more 70's songs like ""Hurt"",""Moody Blue"", and his last hit on the radio the day he died,""Way Down"". even with these songs not included, it's still a GREAT set!"
1," Romantic, relaxing music: This CD is wonderfully romantic & relaxing. It would go well with a jacuzzi bath with aromatic candles, especially with your lover. I usually listen to alternative rock & my boyfriend likes techno music, but this CD was provided in a hotel suite we stayed in, & we fell in love with it."
0," Corny, Boring, and Laughable: How is it possible that all these people consider this to be a good movie? Me and my friends spent most of the movie laughing at the pitful plot line or special effects. It created a decent atmosphere, but the unrealistic events (exploding windmill, one handed severed head catch, etc) made this flick just plain stupid."
1," Really beautiful watch: I love the aesthetics of this. I love the aesthetics of classic analog watches, but I just love digital watches because I can tell the time much faster. Being an Ironman, this thing is very durable and very unlikely to break from just normal wear. Its got your pretty standard feature set, but I'm basically buying it because its cheap and I love the color and aesthetics of it. I'd highly recommend it."
0," Disapointing: This book compares very poorly with the entertaining and well thought out Guns,Germs and Steel. Landes book is a anectodotal ramble. It contains little in the form of a central thesis or argument."
0," Not How I Remember Him: I read Edmund Morris' biography (if you can call it that) and I saw this video on PBS. Both do little to explain the phenomenal popularity of Reagan's presidency and both are a disservice to his memory. If you're a big fan of Reagan, like me, I suggest you pick up a compilation tape of his speeches (the Great Communicator Box Set is the most complete one I've found). I think that's the best way of reliving the memories of a great president."
1," The Other Person's God is the Devil: A dark novel in which Bowen and Du Pre Father Van der Heuval face the all-too-frequent situation of Fundamentalists, those farthest from a prophet's original teaching, who take their own ""truth"" to the ultimate horrors.Never mind that Jesus, and Muhommed, and Budda all urged compassion, and integrity, and joy, their even saying, ""Whoever is not against us if for us."" As in the Viet-Nam war, these groups destroy the village in order to save it, even unto the death of whichever ""other"" person it faces. (A character excuses himself that he should be forgiven causing the death of ""an other,"" as he hadn't intended death, just releasing the victim from the unclean spirit he perceived within the person.)Rodney King says, ""Can't we just all get along?"" Jesus and Muhommed and Budda would be nodding their heads at him."
1," Short good read: This book was incredibly informative, concise, and written for those who want a good lesson on intelligence policy. It has a heavy academic slant and relies solely on open source information. Not recommended for readers looking for answers on ""how"" intelligence is conducted. It focuses on intelligence policies, failures, and successes in communist and democratic nations. It was the perfect length (any longer would beat a dead horse)."
1, D: Good. It is a little firmer than I expected. The standard one I have is very soft compare to this one.
0," Canon Buyers Beware: I have been a loyal Canon user for many years. I own a 30D and the MarkIIID. The Mark IIID was sent back for the recall to address the AF. The work they did to it negatively effected the color balance. It was sent back to the factory. The factory then lost my camera (having shipped it with the wrong FEDEX number). They sent another Mark III. It had back focus problems. In the meantime, another camera was sent as a loaner. It was proudly pronounced in tip top shape and was new. It arrived half packed, used, dirty sensor and dirty contacts for the lens. The AF didn't work. Canon believes that they didn't do anything wrong. Customer Service Rep. Elizabeth Wood responded with a litany of liability-speak but bottom line, they would only send another camera. The MarkIII has significant AF problems, even with the firmware upgrade. Save yourself the stress, don't buy Canon"
1, The Last of Shelia ia great!: One of the best of its kind. The writing and acting are wonderful. A worthy addition to any DVD collection.
0," oh dear: not bad, although not for touch typists. Biggest failing is inability to connect ipaq with expansion sleeve connected, as per other reviewer. Just has to go back to the store for that reason. I thought I might be able to 'adjust' it, but nothing doing.... Shame really 'cause for the price against the Targus, it could be a great alternative"
0," Not for beginners: I bought this book as a beginner in VBA and ended up learning it from totaly different source. The book lacks good examples (those in the book are very cumbersome) and detailed explanation of programming principles (debugging, objects etc.). However, if you do know the basics, you may find a nice reference for the most of common tasks."
0," Nautica not worth it: It arrival and packing were as given. The product however smelt like soapy water (oh bathroom air freshener)the scent lasted no longer than a few hour, fortunately!!i would return it but based on the price it was not worth the effort.Using it to spray my dog house. He seems to like it.Would not recommend this product"
1," Did Anyone Else Notice Roads Must Roll Sounded Familiar: Unless I'm crazy, the theme in ""Roads Must Roll"" is very similar to the intro title from Legend of Zelda: Link's Adventure for the Nintendo.I can dig it!I highly recommend this CD."
1," Wonderful!: These books are amazing! I read the entire series through and now I am re-reading them all again before the next instalment comes out in August. This is Master and Commander meets dragons! Naomi Novik writes with elegance and knowledge beyond any other historical fiction account I have ever read. At times the wording is tidious but all in all a great book with dynamic characters and an intriging plot! If you like history and fantasy but don't want another boring dragon-rider plot, this is the series for you! It is witty imaginative and fun!"
0," Awful Awful Awful: I can't really add anything to what is said in the other reviews. This is a terrible product. It sticks to everything - hands, tables, rugs, dogs, everything. Disgusting. I only wish I had read these reviews before I let my kids put it on their Christmas lists!"
0," Not worth anyones time: This game isn't even worth anyones time or money. I excitedly waited for this game for my birthday to only find out I can unlock the games within 3 hours of gameplay and that most of the games did not utilize the wii remote sensory and advises people to use it as a simple joystick. Also, most of the games and stages are ripoff's of previous mario party games. Even worst is that the computers in the game roll straight 10's or they land on event buttons time after time, even on easy. The fun and challenges once present in mario party is completely lost in this game, especially in the once terrifying duel battles, which doesn't challenge the player nor is anything lost in the end that you couldn't get back within 2 or 3 turns. Buy this game if you want something you can beat a 3 hours and torture your friends with, otherwise don't waste your time. Theirs much better games to play out there."
0," Not for beginners or those needing practical instruction.: I guess I should have read the other two reviews for this book before purchasing. The text doesn't provide enough detail for a novice woodworker or particularly for someone attempting their first instrument to get started. In particular the instrument list should be modified. Simply stating that it includes plans for a lute is misleading when the lute in question is a very Early Medieval type with a skin soundboard. It is more akin to a primitive banjo than what I was looking for. Also, all the drawings are reproduced at such a small scale to be virtually useless and none contain details such as full scale bridge designs or instructions on how to generate one's own patterns. The only useful content in the work is the chapter detailing his method of fretting. It should prove quite useful Caveat emptor!"
1," Shooter does it again: This album has it all: *actual* country music, a couple of rockers and humour (Aviator). The music that's on here puts mainstream country radio to shame. See Shooter live if you get a chance. You won't be disappointed."
0, Is your time valuble: Do not buy this software before checking their own forum.Things you won't be able to do1. Burn a trouble free dvd.2. Keep even audio levels even3.

1," An solid Suspense-Thriller.: When Rudy (Leelee Sobieski) and her bother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) discover, their parents died in a brutal accidental car crash. When Rudy and Rhett are adapted by the Glass (Stellan Skarsgard, Diane Lane) are seeming happy couple. But Rudy discover the dark secerts of the Glass, which also invovled her dead parents.This film has srtong lead performances by Sobieski and Skarsgard.

DVD`s has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and Pan & Scan also alivable. An good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. An short commentary track with/without from a Deleted Scene. Well done film. Super 35. Grade:A-."
0, Ok: Some things had great description while others were a glancing thought. The ending was a bit hasty but enjoyed the old man's humor.
1," Why certain people shouldn't review books: Say you're browsing for a new book online. You decide to read some customer reviews, as they can be rather helpful. Then, halfway into the FIRST DARN REVIEW you read, the author of said review has given away crucial plot elements.Well, thanks a million to you, Ma'am. Who needs to read the novel now that you've posted a generic ""Cliff Notes"" version?And it was sounding good, too."
1," Lifesaver for mama's too!: I am eight months pregnant and bought this humidifier for my baby's nursery. I received this product just in the nick of time! A few days after it arrived, I caught an AWFUL head cold, which included a terrible case of night-time congestion. I felt immediate relief from the moment my husband plugged-in our new ""Cow"" and aimed it's ear at me (the steam comes out of both ears). I was able to breathe all night in comfort without congestion, a dry throat or dry nasal passages. I ran the cow on its highest setting and the water lasted until morning. This item is better than I anticipated and I would highly recommend it to anyone. One more thing, this unit is blissfully QUIET."
1, Addicted!: I absolutely love Downton Abbey and cannot wait for season 3 & 4 to be available on Amazon Prime!! I recommend it to everyone!
0," Is it becoming a legacy product?: This product worked fine with Windows XP Pro and Vista Enterprise (32 bits) only after the Jabra driver was installed. I bought this dongle for a lot of money ($50) last year so that I could make full use of the Jabra headset.Now I have a Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bits OS and there seems to be no driver for this! I really distrust all those external driver sites, if there is one thing I don't want is to install a kernel level driver from an untrusted source.In their site they have a ""Windows Vista Update"" but they don't mention if you have to install the regular (old) version plus the update or just the update. They also fail to mention if that works with Windows 7, even so, would it work with a 64 bit version or just the 2 bit?I would say, if you have Windows 7 better look for something else unless you want to wait until hell freezes over."
1," A Child Describes What It Feels Like To Have Been Loved: I think the vast media attention to crime and serial killers is a shame, so when I read the back cover of this popular book I thought, ""Oh, no!""The book was not about evil so much as about loss, regret and caring for others. The main character was such a much loved child, and her sweet portrait is so fully drawn, that it is hard to read her story and not be left feeling hopeful.The narrative carries you along in the same way as a good mystery novel does.This book is entertaining and involving."
1," A Good Night's Sleep: Our baby never slept well in her bassinett. While we were in the process of moving, we used the Pack n Play bassinett feature instead of setting up her new crib right away. She started sleeping through the night after three days. Next time around, I'll skip the bassinett and just use the Pack n Play. Four stars because of all the cool stuff that comes with it, but not five because the extras don't fit well in the travel bag. I am a big fan!"
1, did like it: i really did like this until the earpeice's kept breaking evry one has broke . the sound quality is amazing i was litteraly driving with my windows down and it still worked i would prefer the new jawbone thouugh it is alot smaller
1," Easy to Install. Hose coils and doesn't want to stay: Strictly speaking as a showerhead its great. Easy to install. HOWEVER the hose coils strangely and the head doesn't want to stay in the base. Overall, I really like it, but IDK that I would ever buy again."
0," Awful: I bought the complete set, so I could get familiar with all of Schubert's piano works. After a couple of weeks, I threw all the disks away. There are much finer artists who bring individuality, verve and style to some of the greatest piano music ever written. Unfortunately, Mr. Kempf is not one of them."
1," Lightweight & compact: This bag is for someone that is only looking for something to carry minimal items -- laptop, mouse, cords. We were just looking for something to be able to protect the laptop & hold the essentials while traveling. The shoulder strap is a must-have. We have only used the bag on a couple of flights, but it seems to be very well made & sturdy enough. Of course it's not going to provide a lot of protection if anything heavy is put on top of it, but it keeps the laptop from being scratched & is easy to carry around. The price was right for what we were looking for & we are happy with our purchase."
0, too ambitious: The author casts such a wide net he is forcedto give short shrift to recondite matters likegauge theory. This hurried romp through deepphysics leaves the reader with jumbled impressionsand occasional outright misinformation (re e.g.omission of quantum decoherence). The author isnot an expert in these fields would have been wiserto bring in a technical collaborator.
1," A Classic.: It's not by Jim Henson, but by his son. It's funny and moving at the same time in old style muppet form. A classic, definitely fit for a family Christmas."
1," Fun as always: This cd was simply FUN music as it was then and the Monkees were then..... I remember when I went to their 20 year reunion concert in 80's, all of a sudden my ears hurt from the sheer screaming of the then-younger kids in the audience screaming from behind me at top of their lungs (like on the TV show opener) as if it was like being in an original Monkees 60's concert venue... Deja Vu all over again...."
1, Outstanding: Outstanding product with no issues. The most recent firmware update really improved the interface and useability. Great product.
1," Brazil-Amazon: This book attempts to cover the whole gamut of wildlife for the Amazon basin and Pananal. It can't do it; no book can. It did make an admirable attempt and as such is a great book for the tourist traveling to the area. On a recent trip north of Manaus, it covered 98% of the bird life. It is concise enough that the occaisional bird wathcer will be able to identify most birds. It is not quite as adequate for other species- fish are very superficial, as are reptiles. I would like to see these expanded. This is a terrific guide for the tourist- concise, adequately complete, and easy to use."
0," Mantovani Lovers Beware!: Those weened on the Mantovani sound will be gravely disappointed with the arrangements on this CD. The overlapping lush string sound of the maestro's arrangements is missing from Roland Shaw's proclivities toward woodwinds and brass. This music can only appeal to those who actually like elevator music with little creativity and novelty. Ironically, many associated Mantovani's music in the late sixties with the elevator sound. This CD only lends credibility to those critics. Before his death, Mantovani knew that only certain songs were suitable for his string orchestra. He generally stuck to popular ""classics,"" not just popular as these selections are. For uplifting music that is strictly Mantovani, look elsewhere, for this music only takes Mantovani's name on a ride down."
0, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!: where is the little girl we once knew?If you are looking for teeny bop it is not here.If you want your children to grow up on sexual references this may be for you.Britney has left her MAIN audience in the cold.Her main audience IS children!DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!
1," This is a great pan!: I was looking for a grill pan and had looked at several. I finally decided to go to the ""Test Kitchen"" web site and see their reviews of the best grill pans (this web site is part of the PBS show of the same name). They said that of all the pans tested, the Simply Calphalon Aluminum 13-inch pan was the best. I got a great price from Amazon and purchased it. I have been using it now for at least 2-3 months and find it perfect for almost all things grilled. What is surprizing is that it also makes great grilled toast. I never use the toaster anymore. It leaves nice grill marks and it pulls the grease away from meats that are grilled. I am very satisfied with this product."
1, 2 Port Battery Tender: I have the single unit Battery Tender but needed another one so I purchased the 2 Port Battery Tender so I only used one plug. The unit worked right out of the box as expected! I would highly recommend this to anyone with the need for 2 chargers.
0," Horrifying and ignorant of science: I have a background in child development, am a practicing Christian and a parent. I don't believe in censoring or burning books but could make an exception for this one. It is a twisted version of Christianity, a twisted interpretation of the Bible, and it has no basis in any research about child development. It's essentially a manual for teaching your kids to fear you and unquestioningly do what they're told by anyone in authority."
0," Not well packaged.: Very disappointed that when we received this, they had the wing done in such a way that the packaging stuck to it when you tried to open it. Very cheaply made to begin with, and that just added to our disappointment of the product. For $6 ($60% off). If I had paid the original $15 asking price I'd be quite upset with the quality of product and packaging. I wasn't expecting it to look authentic, but paper stuck to the wing in a way that you cannot take off was a little much."
0, As reviewed before.... easily breakable.: Great price of course. But is lacking the magnet to have the phone sense it is in holster. Had it for 10 days. On the 10th day it broke while i was getting into my car.
0," Unusable speakerphone, returned: I purchased two of these phones, both were completely unacceptable. Even when you speak directly into the microphone, the people on the other end can't hear you."
1," AWESOME-HTH WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST: I saw these guys in concert opening for my fav band incubus, they were not too spectacular, but i bough the cd and it is great. they have great song writing, huge guitar riffs, excellent drum beat, and they can go soft and personal as well. Home Town Hero could be one of the best bands in the future, with their REAL rock unlike limp bizkit, vines, and those other pop bands who follow what is popular and what fans like"
0, Too noisy even when I set the volume to low: I can't stand more than 5 minutes of this video and I don't want to mess up my kids ears. I wish I can return it.
0, I LOVE this movie wish it wasn't all whispered though: I LOVE this movie! BUT! The sound really does suck. It's all whispers and no matter how loud you turn it up you only get whispers. UNLESS you have surround sound as I have just learned. Surround sound makes it sooooo much better you can actually hear it!
0," WARNING - Does NOT do 100mbps: Amazon's info about this product does not mention that this is a USB 1.1 device. That means that the max throughput that you can get with this device is 12mbps, not 100. The packaging clearly states that this is a USB 1.1 device, so I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't have that in the details.If you want to be able to do 100mbps with USB 2.0, get the TrendNet TU2-ET100 for $5 more."
0," Tank top: Ordered Xl fits like a medium, the color was not a true lilac color. I wish I could return the item"
1," engaging stories about GFP and other fluorescent proteins: Are you working with GFP or other fluorescent proteins? This book is full of fascinating stories about the discovery and harnessing the power of fluorescent proteins. I couldn't put the book down - this is a must-read for all molecular biologists, but is probably easily accessible for non-professionals as well. I liked the design of the book, too. Will make an excellent gift."
0," Not totally worthless: While these lights were a miserable failure in their stated purpose (lighting up drawers) as they didn't stick properly and were difficult to place, they're not totally of no value. They each contain several lithium button batteries which are of a very common size and can be used in other battery-operated devices. I threw the lights away and kept the batteries."
1," OMG. I LOVE YA PARIS!!!: Paris Hilton again amazes the audience with a truly masterful performance. she shows us why she has the determination and the talent to become one of Hollywood's finest actresses.next, i'd like to congratulate tom Putnam for showing us that he has the leadership and skill to rise among the ranks of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.i can't remember the last time i laughed throughout the entirety of a film. this movie gets two big thumbs up for originality, and the best acting in 2008 so far. move aside Indiana Jones, make way for one of the all time greats in the movie industry.cheers Paris"
0," Caps Don't Fit: I bought a couple of these and the threads of both were off just enough to make it nearly impossible to seat the cap properly which resulted in a huge mess all over the blender several times. Conversely, trying to get the caps off iwas equally near impossible even after running under hot water.All edges are unfinished and sharp so look forward to lacerated fingers.I've since thrown them out. A complete waste of money. Try to find true Oster bases which will work properly."
0," Pooh doesn't know my kid's name: I have a daughter, Lucy. That's a pretty common name. However Pooh isn't programed with that one. He knows a lot of names that I've never heard of, but is missing quite a few common ones. The customer support for this error is poor. I also had the download issues that the other customers reported even though I am using XP. I had high hopes for this toy after its write-up in Time, but I was very disappointed and am returning it."
0, not for the weak: I have tendinitis so my hands weren't strong enough to make the plunger work. I'm sure it will be great if you are young.
0," HORRIBLE TRANSFER: EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXCELLENT, THE TRANSFER IS HORRIBLE.SEEMS LIKE A BAD HOME VIDEO TRANSFER.NO MENU, NO CHAPTERS, NO EXTRAS, SUBTITLES ARE OBLIGATORY (NON OPTIONAL)...I WISH THIS HAD BEEN ADVERTISED SO THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THIS DVD.IT JUST RUINS THE MOVIE EXPERIENCE."
1," Artemis Fowl are awesome books: Artemis Fowl books are awesome books to read and listen to as a family, we listened to the first one on our move to Virginia from Colorado and it helped pass almost 2 1/2 of the 4 days it took to get here and then we were hooked.We have listend to and read all but the last on and are reading it right now. They are really fun and the reader of these book has an awesome voice and is really good. enjoy with your kids or read them yourselves,there awesome reading for any age."
0," Just call Kwikset: I also needed an emergency indoor key that were lost in my house. I eventually called kwikset and ordered 20 keys for almost nothing. $5.00 in shipping is ridiculous. The key itself was fine, just overprice shipping."
1," Awesome!: My son loves this robot. It is very educational, plus it sings. Also, it has been dropped several times, and just keeps on ticking."
1, Pet Car Seat: Our Maggie was a good traveler in one car but not in the van so we got this and now she can see outside and is no longer carsick and is a happy little traveler. It was worth the money to be able to take her with us.
1, Great Book: I think this is a very good informative book. It explains things in a simple and understandable manner.
1," Great new product: I purchased this item to accompany our new Samsumg 1080i HD DLP projection tv. our old dvd player was not that good so I was game. The retail store I purchased the tv from made the suggestion, but did not carry it in the store, only offering it as an oline purchase. I knew I could get a better deal than the one they were offering, so I went through Amazon instead. We recieved the dvd player very quickly, a matter of a couple of days. This product is excellent, very light-weight and compact. The dvd player arrived in perfect condition and we have had no problems whatsoever. We recommend this product and the seller to everyone"
1," This song converted me to Janet.: I'm usually not that much of a Janet fan - sure, I listened to her songs, and enjoyed them most of the time. I became a big fan with the release of Velvet Rope, and my interest then faded. Then I heard ""Son Of A Gun"" on the radio. Perhaps Janet's most original song in a while. I'm glad she brought Carly Simon and Missy Elliot (and P.Diddy, if you count the remix) onboard for this, instead of just sampling the ""I betcha think this song is about you..."" line. In fact, the real star of this song is Carly Simon, who steals the show the whole way through."
1," Buy This Album: If you consider yourself a fan of Pearl Jam, Rush, Soundgarden whatever...you gotta give this a spin or 1,000. Just for the experience of listening to songs like My Favorite Headache, Still, Moving To Bohemia, and The Present Tense.Geddy should find time to work with all kinds of artists and do a solo album every other year. I would love to build up a collection of his solo stuff outside of Rush. Bring in a female artist or 2 next time to work with.The only downfall on this disc is a song called The Angels Share. My Lord does it blow. Other than that? 4 Stars."
0, Samsung digital S630: Quality of the picture is average for a point and shoot. User friendliness is average. With only the screen to frame your picture bright sunlight can be a problem.The biggest downside to this camera is battery life. Eight pictures and the camera shuts down. Upon checking the battery with a battery indicator power indicator they still register high to normal power. So..if you aren't taking more than a dozen pictures you might be able to accomplish that feat with just two batteries.
1," Surprise party: this dvd contains 3 great episodes and my 2 favorites the first episode on the dvd is ""the wise elder ham"" mainly about Laura's grandmother and her friend finding each other again. In the second episode my first favorite ""Lets dance sandy"" the ham ham girls ask Hamtaro to ask maxwell if he likes sandy its an adorable episode also the girls are practicing a gymnastics routine and the boys are putting on a play for a festival and at the end Sandy finds out where her long lost brother isThe last episode ""the search for sandy's brother""(2nd favorite)In this episode the ham hams well try to find Sandy's brother which they do and the story is mainly about keeping Sandy away from the clubhouse for a surprise party when the two are reunited their stay together all the time"
0," metallica is dead: This album is very BAD!! Drums sound like a kiddie drum kit purchased at K-Mart. There are no memorable songs on this album, heck it even lacks guitar solos. Anyone looking for OLD style Metallica, And Justice For All and back should not waste their hard earned money on this piece of GARBAGE. Wake up Metallica and go back to the music you played with Cliff Burton, NOW that's what people expect!!! This album was not worth the six year wait, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT GUYS!!"
0," Cool idea, but needed better script: The premise and acting worked pretty well, but they could not overcome the limitations of the script - perhaps good for a sappy date night rental, but you do not need to own it"
1," Best kids bike around: This thing is heavy - that's a good thing. The material is thick, the welds are great - it will last forever. Compared to other brands that I looked at, Schwinn's build is much, much better.The hand brakes are a little weak."
0, NOT as pictured: Beware.... this photo is for a Shanta sink which costs 199.00. The VESSEL sink is NOT as pictured.For specs. on the Vessel and the Shanta sink go to website for Renovator's.
0," Pathetic!: My children received this movie as a gift, and I wish they hadn't. Thumbelina is a WEENIE! She is constantly at the mercy of everyone else, and doesn't appear to have a brain of her own. I realize that she is very small, but she just goes along with whatever the other characters want her to do, even to the point of getting married! She is NOT a strong female character, nor a good example for our daughters, or sons for that matter. I would not recommend this movie at all."
0," my review: I was not happy as I would have like to see live acts not video. I also wish they had put all the acts that were on the C.D. The dvd was cut to 17 acts,and it was not what I had expected."
0," POOR OLD SUTHERLAND......: No I am sorry, I just cannot recomend this recording at all. I love Dame Sutherland, she had one of most beautiful coloratura sopranos of our time. She has made wonderful recordings of Bellini and Donizetti operas.... this is NOT one of them. She sounds so old and it is almost painful to hear her pinch out these high ackward notes. Please don't waste your money on this one."
0," Unfortunately, still not the same ...: From ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" to the ""Great American Songbook"" series, a Rod Stewart album has been an automatic purchase for me. Through the inevitable ups and downs, I still have enjoyed each album ... until this latest effort. It sounds strained, sleepy, and lifeless. The song selection is very poor, and certainly does not deserve the label of 'rock classics'. In the past, even with mediocre material, Rod's energy could make each song come alive. He hasn't (or he can't) with this material on this album. The songs sound more like hymns or lullabies; certainly something that I would never accuse Rod of in the past. Wait for his next album. Rod Stewart is capable of much more."
0," Extremely boring and forgettable: This is your typical story of Mings vs. Chings. It tries to be large scale, but way too much time is spent on the story and it really becomes a struggle to sit through. A General of the Mings has been killed and now his family is on the run. Polly Shang Kwan plays the elder sister and Carter Wong helps them out because he was once saved by the General from execution.Polly Kwan has a memorable entrance into the movie but other than a lion dance and the final fight, nothing else stands out. What really made me mad is that Carter Wong doesn't even participate in the final fight.1/5Picture quality from Groundzero is bad but watchable."
0," Is this the Pilot?: Futurama - Bender's Big ScoreBy far the most horrible episode of Futurama ever. I am such a fan of Futurama and when I found out this was going to be released I could not wait to get a copy. Sitting through this was an unbelievable boring, unfunny, and slow ordeal. I recommend that this is a rent grade DVD. Something is really off with this DVD, so off in fact that I thought I was watching a pre-pilot episode."
1," Always need microsoft points: Standard purchase, you need MS points, you purchase MS points. Buying in bulk quantity is your best bet. You will always need MS points. Every game releases DLC that requires MS points to purchase."
1," Great: I was very pleased with this movie, it was faithful to the spirit of the book and adapted beautifully to the screen. I understand why they would have taken a little flavor out of the world in order to streamline the inevitable need to spend minutes explaining, such as magicians never saying the number between 7 and 9, and that Rincewind was more of a bumbling fool and rather than a bit of a swindler for instance. All in all, a fun film."
0, Use Time machine.: Another computer ravaging piece of crapware from prosoft. Like Drive idiot 1 & 2 this product does not work and is totally unessessary. Time Machine with Leopard is awesome and it works. Don't trust prosoft they don't support their products and charge for updates on 2 months after purchase that do nothing for software that does less than nothing.
0," Ronco Oven: It did not work, The teeth did not meet with the drive teeth. sometimes it would turn a half of turn thenstop. It was a piece of crap that I just didn't need. It was already sent back. and need it off mycredit card right away."
1," A Life-Saver Product: This product provides an Activity for the infant that allows you to watch television, talk on the phone, or whatever. My grandaughter enjoys this mat very much."
1," Whut Is Tha Deal: Whut's tha deal with everybody hating on my boy Memph Bleek??? I know a lot of cats down south never heard much of the album outside of Is That Yo Chick? (The Lost Verses) which isn't as good as the original to me but this album is the best he's put out so far and is better than Bean's sophmore offering The Reason. I guess there is still that playa hation towards the Roc-A-Fella family still going on which is bogus because they've got one of the strongest labels going. But this album could very easily been a classic if Bleek would have left a couple of tracks off and worked with another producer like Timbaland. But with cuts like Hustlers, All Types Of Sh*t, I Get High, Is That Yo Chick (The Lost Verses), They'll Never Play Me and I Got My Mind Right this is definitely one of the R-O-C's best albums. Holla!..."
1," A Fantastic Compilation of A Fantastic Band: Really, it must be hard to summarize such a broad and diverse career in onl y two discs, but U2 has done it with their second best of album. For me, I really got into U2 in the early ninties, so this album picks up right where I joined the parade. The Only downside I see to this compilation is the remix of Electrical Storm, as I much prefer the original"
1," Great memories only one thing though: This movie brought back memories, of when I was a teenager Its just as I remember it..Only one thing, and it did upset me. I dont know if people will notice. There is a scene almost at the end when Joel and Toni are leaving and there parents run into each other, its here where I noticed something was missing?? The music..in the original movie it had Nicolette Larson's Lotta Love.. In this video its been deleted, and that really pained me, because that was part of the reason I bought this movie. I did not notice until later that it mentioned this on the cover of the video, I wonder why this was done.However overall the movie is safe clean AMERICAN fun from the 70's.. Great comedy."
0," Simply Terrible: absolutely terrible device....had it since christmas and it has been dissapointing to say the least. Always disconnects when I am on a call and it is made of cheap worthless pastic....it doesnt feel good on your ear either, I mean, if you shake your head you feel like its falling off. The only reason I give it 1 star is because it looks cool....hah thats it."
1," So far so good...: My kids love their new 'big boy' chairs. These chairs are lightweight and easy to get in and out of the car but they have a solid feel. They are simple to put together and the seatbelt fastens and unfastens easily around the chair. My kids love the little cupholders, no more dropping their drinks and then crying for mommy to pick it up! They also use the cupholders to store whatever little toys they want to bring along for the ride."
1," Better Off: Flipping the Switch on Technology: This was an interesting book. As someone that is interested in ""going off the grid"" in a low tech style I was intrigued by this book, andinspired that Eric found happiness living without electricity.However, it was disappointing at the same time, because in the end, Eric and his wife moved out of the community, and returned toa more electricity dependant life.I think I would have been more inspired and excited about the book if ,in the end, the couple would have found contentment withthe mennonite community they were living in, and continued living without electricity.it is a book worth reading."
1," Nice Product: The keyboard and mice are really comfortable, but when you use ctrl+c or ctrl+v for copying and pasting, you will find it's not working unless you hit c or v very hard. And it takes time to get used to the layout of home/end/pageup/pagedown."
0," Horrible.: This book contains more mis-statements, or just plain lies, than anything I have read in a long, long time. Poorly written, full of nonsense and boorish. Wasserman was definitely smoking something when he tried to write this! I am amazed this was ever published."
1," Great brake controller for old truck: I installed this brake controller in a 1955 GMC pickup truck that I use for towing. Just follow the diagram for wiring and it just works like a breeze. I like the way you can adjust easily the voltage with the dial on the left and the mounts provided allows you to install it a convenient location under the dash (it works in any position).If you want to install this in a more modern truck without tapping directly into the wires, you will need additional adapters at extra cost."
1, Writing is better than first season: I liked this season better than the first.....Sookie is slightly less annoying and the plot is a little richer.
0, Delta BS100 band saw: The DELTA BS100 BANDSAW THE BS SHOULD STAND FOR BULL **** But I will not finish that.This is the absolute worst power tool and I use the word tool lightly more like an unsafe toy. The saw looks good but that is were it stops being good for anything except frustration
1," Best Tarot Deck For Followers of the Dragon Path: I dont really appreciate the way one of these reviews said that it was bad because of the differant names and meanings, because, in TRUTH the meanings are very accurate and helpful. And if that reviewer had read the book completely, maybe they would understand this IS NOT a Tarot deck based off of christian beliefs. There is nothing christan about this tarot deck at all! therefore, no devil card, and a few others. These cards have really been accurate for me. I recommend them for any Dragon Path follower who wishes to further their connection with Dragon-kind. They really will help you gain a more benefical connection. Not recommended for narrow minded people."
0," More Interesting Than Useful: This is one of those academic texts over which programming fetishists salivate. Those of us that program for a living won't find this book very useful. There are some interesting algorithmic niches explored for procedural programmers that one in a million may find useful. But truly Higher Order Perl isn't about functional algorithms, it's about object modelling. For instance, why discuss the primitive concept of callbacks, when Object Oriented Programming is possible?"
0, Great Show ... Greedy Distributors: I echo what many people have been saying. Why these shows are distributed in half season sets is shameful to the public. In fact there were not even royalties involved from shows that are so old . This is a huge slap in the face at the average person. To do this to us is criminal. Saturday Night Live was an Hour and half and their shows are released in entirety at a fairly reasonable price ... high 30s low 40s. If Saturday Night Live can do it than surely this company can. Don't fret fellow My Three Sons fans. Most of these volume sets end up in Amazons special sale section in shorter time than you think.
1, Xena cd volume 4: I'm a huge fan of this show. I have all 3 prior cd's. I enjoyed this cd more than the 1st because it doesn't have all the funeral durges of volume one. I like the Indian music. Definitely a cd of last season's (music) trip through India. If you're into it I suggest buying it here. I wish I did because I payed way too much elsewhere. It would've been even better if they would've added the theme song to this volume for the heck of it. In my opinion at Amazon's price it's a good buy.
0," Much quieter than advertised: These alarms are advertised to be 120 dB, which is in the range of a jet engine. However, it was difficult to hear the alarm from two rooms over, and it would definitely not wake me out of bed. I noticed that there was some controversy over the loudness of the alarm in previous reviews. So I measured the loudness objectively with a SPL meter. Three feet directly in front of the alarm, the sound level was 92 dB. Three feet off to the side of the alarm, the sound level was 86 dB. So optimistically, the alarm is 28 dB lower than advertised. 10^2.8 = 631, so the alarm is 631 times less loud (in terms of energy) than advertised. 92 dB is about the sound of a truck from 10 meters away, as opposed to the sound of a jet engine."
0," A little better written than a Hardy Boy book.: This had an excellent subject, the turn of the millenium and hidden scrolls, but the writing was as childish as a paperback romance novel. It did inspire me, though. I felt if this can get published, maybe I can to. It inspired me to take a writing course."
0," Was Clancy in a rush to finish the book?: I haven't read Clancy's books for a while and I think I am not going to read anymore. The Teeth of the Tiger is no more than ""Chapter One"" of a new saga involving three smart kids (Jack Ryan Jr and his two cousins, the Caruso's brothers). First hundred pages are quite good indeed as Mr. Clancy spent a lot of time in providing details of the main characters (probably to push the new saga) but the last chapters are really weak and, in my view, written in a hurry. Living in Italy (where the final stages of the book take places) I also noted some mistakes. Mr Clancy could have come to Italy on holiday before completing its masterpiece..."

0," Worthless: After only 3 months of occasionally using the headphones for Doom 3, one of the right side speakers began constantly giving a static noise when any audio was played, making them unusable unless you like to hear digital scratching all the time. This is not the constant white noise described by the other reviewer. Not to mention that there is absolutely no support for the equipment through the companies web site except a voicemail I have yet to be called back on.BLAH"
0, Get the grow w/ me Portable booster instead: this is a terrible seat. The tray is very hard to put on and if you happen to get a finger while trying it would be very bad. I was always worried about that until I put the tray on and my son started screaming... I had pinched his skin on his tummy and cut him pretty bad. I felt terrible. I called the company and told them - they are replacing my seat w/ the grow w/ me (i have had that in the past and its a great seat). Their service was good - so I was happy w/ that... but they should just stop making this seat.
0, blanket too small: although blanket is quite and my puppy loves it.... the price was only $1 but by the time you pay shipping it came to $8. I think $8 is too expensive for a blanket the size of a hankerchief.
1," Cateye CC-MC100w Micro: Works very well, I like the wireless feature which makes it easy to install. Easy to calibrate I recommend this product."
1," Fantastic find: What a riot to have something you grew up with and of course your parents never saved. It was a definite hit at the ""girls"" reunion."
0," Great Anime, Horrible ""Box Set"": The item description claims 6 disks and the sound track. That is not what I received. I should have read the reviews before finalizing the purchase. The episodes are no better than the files I downloaded online. Definitely not the quality I was expecting for a product that claims is original. This is a BOOTLEG. Buyers be warned!"
0, florence of araba: the print was so small that I could not read it. At least not for 200 plus pages. I had to go to my nook and buy it.
0," nothing special here: Can't say I noticed any difference at all. Not at all. Then again, I am no master gardener like some claim to be. I am no shill either."
1," Enchanting book: A friend encouraged me to read this book, as a ""change of pace"" from my usual choice of reading material. I have to say, it was an enchanting book. Kingsolver's style is very readable. Her use of dialect creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable. Her attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive. The journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences. She seems to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge. Her involvement with others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would like to claim as our own. A very companionable book."
0," Book Title & synopsis misleading: I purchased this book thinking it would be a good primer for learning digital scrapbooking. Sadly, there are only 4 pages in the book devoted to setting up a scrapbook page & various techniques. Those 4 pages are good but not worth the purchase price. The focus of the book really is on photography and photo-editing and a lot less on scrapbooking."
1," Sam Brown is a Superb artist...: ...and this album was her debut release from 1988, though it spawned a couple of top twenty hits she has spent little time in the charts since but continues to produce some great work.She has a huge cult following and has become an artist on the fringe of the mainstream which is a place many artists chose to be, and I believe she may be one of them; here they do not have to bow and scrape to popular demands and the whims of record producers. Here they can work freely, develop a strong fan base and maintian robust artistic integrity.""Stop!"" is recognisable now because Jamelia released it last year for the film, ""Bridget Jones the edge of reason"", but she has not even half the depth and richness of voice to belt the song out like Sam does on this original. It's an oldy but a goody and a descriptive work in terms where British pop/soul was headed in the late 80's before the manufactured craze took over. Buy ""Stop!"", and you won't stop with Sam Brown!"
1, awesome!!: I think the neighbors love it as much as we do ...Very easy to operate and was easy to install.
1, Opens up multiple religious vistas of beauty and truth: This incredibly profound and spiritually moving book should be on every book shelf of every human being so that we can be reminded that there is a divine and loving way to live and be in this world. I love this book and highly recommend it.
1," Scrumptious: Exotic locales and glistening nude female bodies make this a must-own DVD. Debbie, Angel, Sung Hi, Lana, Michele, Doreen, Shellani, Ashley and Shana in no particular order, give what I believe to be the best ""performances"" on the disc, while Amy, Sarah, Scottie and Kristin deliver great, but not stellar segments. They are all at least a tiny bit ditzy, some considerably more so than others, but who is really listening to the commentary? The male actor on the disc occasionally gets in the way, especially during the Shana Hiatt segment but can generally be easily ignored. The quality of pacing and length of the segments is a matter of personal opinion but the quality of the content cannot be denied.This being my first Playboy video purchase, I cannot find much to complain about, including the price. This was basically from the relatively early stages of DVD technology, so its special features are minimal. The girls themselves are pretty special features in their own right."
0," Not a good read.: At times, I thought I knew more about the main character's sex life with a detective than I had about the case at hand. I can never start a book and not finish, but from about page 40 onward, I wished that I had never started this one. I have never read anything by Kathy Reichs before...the plot was great, it is what drew me to the book. But, her manner of writing and her methods for suspense were below par."
1," Nice but over priced: I love Agnetha's voice and the cd, but it is over priced. I could have downloaded the same thing from I tunes for $9.99. I see you no longer show it in stock."
0," Disappointment: I started reading this book and was bored after a couple of pages. I expected the book to be informational, but it seemed to be written for entertainment, and not the kind I like. Maybe I misunderstood something, but the author seemed to imply that there may be gods hiding in the 4th dimension. I wasted 3 bucks on this piece of literature."
0," Really reaching: I find it rather silly that this book is making the suggestion that Tolkien was making some sort of religious commentary. Why? Because Tolkien himself, in a forward for one edition of the books, says there is no hidden meaning in these books. Christianity or any other modern religion has no place in the fantasy world of Middle Earth."
1," It does what it does: Simple and straightforward. Does what it's supposed to: keep the tap clean, and nasties out. (Way too many words required to get the point across...)"
0," ""The Secret"" All Over Again: Bull and fluff. This book was a huge disappointment considering it has been #1 on the New York Times Bestseller's list for a few weeks now.It really is about making wishes and dreams come true by telling the magical universe what you want. Sound familiar? That's right. It's a rehash of ""The Secret""."
1," Best hair brushing brush I've found: This brush is great for hair brushing. I have thick, fine straight hair, and the bristles on this brush leave my hair smooth, soft and shiny. This is the only brush I've owned where I wanted to brush my hair. It doesn't look like much, but this is a quality product."
1," Great pan, but not for smooth top radiant stoves: I have the 6 quart version of this pot. On the positive side, it's a serious competitor to All-Clad. Three-ply construction, heavy weight, and with the very nice rolled edge, which makes it easy to pour from. I LOVE the brushed finish, which hides the ugly water spots our hard water leaves behind on a mirrored finish.The one huge downside for me is that the pan is NOT flat on the bottom. Rather, it's concave. A straight edge reveals that the center is a good 1/8"" (3mm) higher (further away) than the outer edge. On a smooth top radiant range, only the outermost inch (or so) of the edge is in full contact with the burner. This greatly slows heat transfer, making it quite slow to boil water or heat a big pot of soup. On a coil-type electric or gas range, it works perfectly. However, the concavity renders the pan far less than satisfactory on a smooth top radiant range. (I can't speak to an induction range.)"
0," Wrong size, wrong color: I recently ordered a 65cm pink balance ball from this listing. I received a 55cm purple ball instead. The package label said 65cm, but when I had inflated it, it measured at 56cm and was woefully too small for me to use.Fortunately Amazon has phenomenal customer service and promptly refunded my purchase, but I would not purchase through YogaAccessories again."
1, Flash from a different perspective.: Great book but you will need to read it all to get the maximum benefit. You get good depth on actionscript but you will also learn how to structure your thinking from an actionscript based perspective vs. an artwork one. Good insite into bandwidth issues and how code driven behavior can openup a whole new world for a flash user. I am a designer who has dabbled in coding on and off and I was able to finish an game for a client in maybe 20 hours while I was learning ActionScript. Great place to start once you have had some time with flash's art tools.
0, Not for newborns: I agree that this is not for newborns. We are taking it back for a swing that reclines or the glider swing. Our newborn has vomited almost every time she has been in it from the position it makes her sit in & its almost impossible to keep her head supported. If it would recline it would be a lot nicer. If it was for a bigger baby I might consider it but not for a newbie.
0," Oxo Can Opener: This device appears at first to be an excellent product. However, very soon after I acqauired the product, two errors occurred: (i) the magnetic lid device began to malfunction, since the cutter did not sever the lids all the way around; (ii) and more importantly the product fell apart after two months, because the small pin at the top of the product holding the two halves of the product together fell out or otherwise failed. I was able to reassemble the two halves by reinserting the pin and fumbling around and finally reseating the two halves. However, at this price, such failure so early in the product's useful life is unacceptable."
0, boring: I find this book to be boring and long winded. They could have listed the five languages of lone on two sheets of paper and had all the use full info.
0," NOT a DR SEUSS BOOK: This is an appropriate book for kids less than 2 years old. It is a vocabulary book that simply lists a bunch of pictures and the words that goes with the pictures. It lists many of the common every day items that you would find in a house. It is not clever and I dare say, it's not _really_ a Dr. Seuss book The Illustration quality is WAY BELOW AVERAGE compared to ANY picture book for young children.Like many books, if its the first one your parents give to you, you will probably love the book. I believe that this is why some other reviewers have raved about this book."
0," More history than humor: As an uninformed infant, I knew very little about the Watergate affair besides general details until I read this book. Thus, if knowing who Bebe Rebozzo strikes you as important and you don't have the patience to wade through a Nixon biography, this book is for you. The essays are obviously collected from news-paper columns, since they often feature the same litany of facts about Watergate over and over, meaning that the humore quickly wears off. The book does feature some truly witty columns however, such as an imagined conversation between Brezhnev and Kissinger."
0," Terrible: The orchestra and chorus are not up to this piece. The intonation and blend are horrible, and the soloists far below average.The Dulcissime, the climax in tessitura of the piece, is absolutely ruined by a substandard soprano soloist effort.Avoid."
0," A mixed Bag as well...: I didn't know she even came out with this cd, I remember when Call on Me came out and your heard about it for a week and then it pretty much disappeared! At first I was really surprised how strong and great the the album was. I used to play it on my ipod all the time, but then it eventually wore off and got really lackluster. To me this is better then her previous album,but it's still not that great. I thought some her song choices sucked... Call on me was ok... Do it to me was really execellent(hot beats!).Get it Out me was pretty good as well. There's some crappy material and some good material. It's a mixed bag overall. If you like Neyo or rihanna's latest cd's then this def. the album for you to get. I would recommend this to any pop music fan or r & b you can get your use out of it!"
1," Ahhh, Very Cute!: This is a great song, very cute just like the tubbies them selves. Great for the kiddiewinks!"
0, how do I install this product: the hard drive arrived without any installation instructions or mounting hardware. It didn't even have a packing slip.
0," There is literally no reason to buy this: Buy a blue ray player, HD doesnt exist anymore. Even if it did, having a little one attached to your xbox is just a waste of money. It doesnt upscale normal dvds unlike a lot of standard dvd players (you can get for about the same price) now a days or blue ray players."
1," If you want a very cool-looking little astronaut: Then this is the perfect one! Bought this for my 3.5yo little boy and it was a HUGE hit! While other kids were wearing the usual Batman, Superman, Woody, Buzz, etc costumes, he was a standout! It's not your run of the mill costume for kids. The quality is great too. Looks like an authentic astronaut costume, what with the NASA patches and all. It does run a tad small, and I took the advise of other reviews and bought size 4/6, although my little boy is only 3.5yo and he's on the slim side. I just had to tighten the belt a bit, and it was perfect. Good value for money!"
0," Wet Hair: I was so excited to finally find a swim cap to keep my hair dry during swimming. I thought I found it but My Swim Cap does not work at all. It is more comfortable and easy to put on but does not keep the hair dry. I did notice that less water got into the cap than my normal silicon cap, but non-the-less my hair was still wet. If you are looking for comfort, buy it. If you want to keep your hair dry, do not purchase."
0," Waste of Time: If this movie was a mocumentary it would be great. The fact that the gentleman this film is about is real and that someone actually took the time and effort to make a movie about him is the definition of stupid. Do not waste your time and watch this. I feel lesser of a human being for having seen half this movie. If I had finished it, suicide would be the only answer. This movie is THAT BAD. You have been warned."
0," Item received is not Item Pictured or described.: I received a package containing a box labeled:ValleyPUGP3-3I 3""/ 75mm Gear Puller (3 jaw).-Picture of the one pictured here on AmazonBut the box contained a totally different puller.Company claims it was a mistake and sent wrong one but I find this hard to believe. The box has a picture of the same puller on it. And company opted to refund my money instead of sending me the puller pictured in the ad. Although they did let me keep the puller they did send. But puller sent is crap and wont work on what I need it for. Hooks are to big and from the picture of the one in the ad I am confident that it would have worked for what I needed it for.So 1 star for being the wrong item. Otherwise judging from the photo in the ad. If I had gotten that one it probably would have been a great tool and worked.Bottom line do not order this tool from Toolprice via Amazon.com there is no way of knowing whether you will have the same experience as I have had."
1," This is it.: Throw your books away.The pros:- Whispernet (free wireless downloading)- Great battery life- Great screen, very readable- Tons of books- Cheaper books (still a tad pricey in some instances)- All your books in one place!- No clutter! Let kindle be your book shelf!The cons:- PDF's read poorly. Not the kindles fault.- Needs more books.We have a balance we want to strike here. I with we had everything with the kindle. There are many O'reilly books for instance I'd like to see on here.If you have a relative or family member who loves to read, get them this. You won't regret it.I'm a happy kindle user. I thank the guys at Amazon for providing a great place to get used books cheap. But with Amazon I can get comparable prices (when you include figure in shipping) and what's best if there is No clutter! It's all in a handy dandy portable. These guys are geniuses!"
0," Leaky toliet: This is my second royal potty. I had one for my now 6 year old and the sensor for the music quit working totally and also with this one. Now with my almost 3yr old, I purchased it again thinking it would be rewarding,not now. I am finding that everytime he goes, it is all over the floor or soaks a towel that I have started putting under it for easier cleanup. He aims like he should and I can't figure out how and why there is a puddle on the floor and the bowl is in correctly. He also complains his bottom hurts if on it to long due to the small seat size. I am having a difficult time training him #2 for I can't get him to sit very long to do so. Do not recommend this."
0," So much possibility, so little result: Disclaimer: I couldn't finish it.My son and I read about 1/2 this book before finally closing it for good. Perhaps that tells you all you need to know. We kept reading, wanting to like the book, wanting to see if SOMETHING was going to happen, anything. But chapter after chapter only got us more confused and frustrated. Even as we gave up, the action was picking up -- but too little, too late.There was a real sense of originatlity to this book, a sense of going where no kid's book had gone before. But in the end, all that originality lacked purpose -- original ideas need to point to something. This book had no point. But then, we only made it through half of it. Maybe your 9-year-old has more patience than mine. Check that: has more patience than me!!!"
1," Tremendous journal for women artists: I cannot say enough good things about this special book, which I discovered at an independent bookstore (and am forever grateful for that!) ... For anyone who is a fan of well-written journals and diaries, including those of May Sarton and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, this book will be a real treasure. I couldn't put it down, and consider it one of the best books on being an artist that I have ever read.I should add that it would be especially comforting and inspiring for women who want to be artists (or writers) yet still maintain close, loving families and home life. For many women today, it is an ""either or"" proposition, but I love the way Anne Truitt shows how her domestic life informs and balances her art. This viewpoint give us all courage if we want to attempt the same lifestyle. Truitt raised three children on her own, and made her mark as an artist -- and a wonderful writer as well. What an inspiration for us all."
0," Pairing Difficulties: These are excellent for pairing with phones. However, my new Dell laptop didn't pair well with them at all. When listening to music, they were horrible sound quality and this was when I was sitting at the computer. Also, don't plan on using these for Skype. Even with the proper setting they don't work well. Also, when wearing them for long periods of time they really hurt the ears. I would recommend a different model of Jabra."
1," Pure percussion, pure enjoyment: I was drawn to this release by Bill Bruford's name and was not disappointed by my purchase. Pete Lockett is a world-class percussionist who gathered together other able colleagues to produce this CD. For all you curious Bruford fans, Bill appears on roughly half the tracks and spends most of that time behind his kit.The CD's rhythmic explorations vary between direct attacks and gentle, almost hypnotic, soundscapes. Expect a lot of Indian/Eastern rhythms here. It's a great record for shuffle play, and stands well on its own as a background ""soundtrack"". Still, there is much here that rewards direct and intentional listening. If you like all percussive instrumental albums (ala Mickey Hart's Planet Drum and its kind), then you will fully enjoy this offering, and eagerly await a Pete Lockett's Network of Sparks 'Two'."
0," very obvious!: I know lots of people liked this movie but, I for one did not. It was very obvious within the first 10 minutes of this movie that you would know how it was going to end. I don't know who pared up Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron but, they make a lousy couple. They just don't click together. There is no chemistry there. I would recomend renting this one first before thinking about buying it."
0," Poor video: The video is very poor on this, but hey it's the Temptations! It's not my favorite concert but I'm glad I have it. But if you are craving listening to the Temptaions, get the movie instead. It is excellent!!"
1," Good for the money.: First of all, these bags are huge. Although the zipper opening is a bit on the small side, I was able to get my three section 7 1/2 ft. pre-lit tree inside with help from my son. You need someone to hold the bag open and the other person to actually put the tree parts in the bag.I purchased two bags because I have two trees, the other being a 6 ft. pencil tree with a wooden trunk. Only the top ten inches or so separates on this tree, so I was concerned that the whole trunk might not fit. Again, with help from my son, we were able to get the tree in with an inch or so to spare in length. There was so much extra space otherwise, that I probably could have put both trees in the same bag with a tight fit.The quality of the material used for the bag could be better, but then it would cost considerably more. I only paid $6.99 each with free shipping, so I definitely feel like I will get more out of it than what I paid. With it being stored inside, the bag should last several years."
0," Don't bother...: Unless you are painting stucco, don't bother! Granted, it went quickly, but the rollers left nap ALL over the wall, so we switched to the sponge rollers and that was even worse. I'm so sorry I wasted my money on this."
0," Quality and color not as expected: I don't like to write negative reviews, but I want to let others know about this paper. I have a HP Officejet Pro printer, so I thought that HP paper would be the best way to go. This paper made all of our printed photos look dark and dingy. I had Staples paper prior to purchasing this, and I ended up purchasing Office Depot Premium Photo Paper Gloss after, and both printed much nicer. I would not buy this product again and don't know what to do with all I have left..."
0," Sorry, but I have to rant about this: It's very weird to say this, but I HATE how a perfect little girl she is. It's annoying. She's always the heroine, it's EVEN more annoying!"
0," chaos: I have only browsed online excerpts from this book, however just based on them, I find this book very chaotic and without real value.I agree, that if you are interested in a real revelation, go for the ""Poem of the Man-God"" by Maria Valtorta ! It is a detailed account of Jesus life and teaching. Even a hasty look at Urania tells me they Urantia teachings are completely contrary to those of the Poem's. One example:""My brother, good and evil are merely words symbolizing relative levels of human comprehension of the observable universe. "" (Urantia)""There is nothing entirely harmful in creation. Only the Evil is exclusively harmful, and woe to those who let them be bitten by it. One of the fruits of this biting is the inability to distinguish Good from Evil"" (The Poem of Man-God)I want to keep away from the NewAge babble.."
0," Sick but Stylish: Just let me begin by saying that this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.However!It is not the worst HORROR movie I've ever seen. It's a scary movie, true. And the effects and design of the film are breathtaking.But this is an awful, awful movie. The plot is rediculous and frequently predictable. There are parts of the movie that I found absolutely sickening, and I have a strong stomach for gore. The ending is terrible, and also predictable.It's a mean-spirited, badly acted, predictable, poorly written, disgusting piece of garbage movie.But it is a scary horror movie.Hope I hammered my points home. Avoid this piece of dreck."
1," imaginary review: Since Disney has recalled and discontinued this item - out of spite? - I guess I won't be seeing it after all. What strange policies Disney has! This title was begged for for a decade, then given the deluxe treatment, then yanked 2 weeks after distribution. Wonder why?UPDATE: It's good to have friends, I did get to see the dvd, and - wow - it lived up to my childhood memories, in fact exceeded them. Shameful still that Disney dumped then withdrew this fantastic title. Well, I guess Disney like Pirates so much that they want video pirates to distribute this film for them. Big news, Disney - they're up to the task."
0," Good Special Effects--Bad Movie: 2012 is a rip off. The special effects are decent; although very ridiculous in many places. The story-line is typical of the big budget end-of-the world flick (an absurd love story replete with long-sufferng children, the jilted lover--who obviously has to die heroically-- and the ""got-you-back-again"" husband). It's worth watching for the laughs, in fact it is going to become one of our groups ""must see"" films during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Gatlinburg. We'll be adding this one to a couple of other ""wonderful"" films such as Donte's Peak (ummm, people stew) and The Mummy (E-mo-tep). Oh yeah...lots of destruction--that's we like."
1," This CD is a ground breaker.: With all of the decked out beats and sounds on this album, i believe the trio of Master p, bun b, and pimp c on the song titled break em off somethin is definetely the tightest track on the album. In fact that one song would cause me to purchase the album ya know."
1," Great tool: A great little tool. None of it's functions are amazing, but in a pinch, it can be a lifesaver. It's earned it's place in my wallet many times over. My only gripe is that in a wallet, the plastic splits and cracks over time, which means the once tight case starts to fits the tools loosely, and the tools tend to fall out when you take the card out of your wallet. I end up buying a new swisscard about once a year when things get bad. I'd happily pay double for an all-metal swisscard, but Victorinox doesn't sell them."
1," Something less, something more...: I don't expect this review to be 'helpful' as I've already read some very articulate descriptions of this work of art. If they haven't convinced you by now....please listen to this, ....please buy this.... chances are you will never regret it."
0," NO JOOD: This was the absolute worst book I have ever read. It was incredibly juvenile and I simply became ill every time I read the word ""jood."" It was not very realistic, I was sick of reading how they kissed ""down"" and the way Raheim reacts to Mitchell in one scene is downright disturbing! Would it have been done this way if this were a story about heterosexuals? There's more to a relationship than sex and kissing ""down."" I think if I were a little younger, perhaps 15 or so I would have enjoyed this book, however, since I am 23 years old-I have to say I will NOT be purchasing books 2 and 3."
0," ohhh baby!: To say that David Mamet is an utter thumping no-talent is to gravely insult no-talents. This movie is so bad it would be inappropriate for me to explain what is bad about it. This would be analogous to calling the cops to a scene of mass slaughter and having them arrive and say, ""Sooo... what seems to be the trouble here?""""Well, these people... they're all dead.""""Aaaand that's... bad?"""
0," For Love or Country, The Soundtrack: Do Not Buy This Album thinking you are going to hear the music presented on its ""'click here to listen"" button. That music is very beautiful and clearly above any of the things you will hear on the album. I hold this against Mr. Sandoval personally for not knowing what his people are posting on his site. I feel this has been done on purpose to promote this very unexceptional album. It is deceit, plain and simple."
1," The funniest movie!: I watched both Dead Man on Campus & The Curve (starring Keri Russell and Matt Lillard), and although the concepts were the same, Dead Man was just indescribably better. The way Mark-Paul Gosselar and Tom Everett Scott interacted was hilarious and the way the story was layed out was just great. If it weren't for that Cliff guy, who got annoying at times, the rating would have been higher though. Never-the-less, I'm definately going out and buying the movie on video as soon as it comes out."
0," Great Without Vista: This machine is a FANTASTIC XP machine. The problem is its only ready for VISTA straight off the disk. I bought this machine because I couldn't wait another year for a new machine. Wasn't thrilled about vista (and no i don't hate microsoft) but because of the heavy system requirements it puts on the machine - i don't think this is a good machine for Vista.Wiped the hard drive clean which took care of my ""crapware"" problem also. Then loaded XP sp2. I had a really hard time getting drivers for this because it takes a lot of work arounds but i did manage it. Now I love this machine. Its a great XP machine and i wish HP would just come out and support this with XP drivers.A great buy if you have the time to load XP and are not gaming. Otherwise, Pay the extra for a better machine."
0," Does Not Work: Easy set up. Simply does NOT work. I have no IR or RF interference and I set up to debug by puting the transmitter in the adjacent room and placing the receiver directly in front of the unobstructed units 8 feet away. Cannot get any device to work through this transmitter. If I make 20 keystrokes, ONE will get transmitted successfully. Great concept. Really poorly engineered."
0," The Carbohydrates Addict's Lifespan Program: Personalized Plan for Becoming Slim,Fit & Healthy in your 40's, 50's and 60's and: I was expecting simple daily meal plans and it was a lot of reading and recipes that are not always food items on hand. I was really disappointed in the book."
1, Excellent pins - strong and work well: I use the Grex pins in my Grex pinner. These pins seem to feed efficiently and shoot cleanly every time. I've done thousands of pins now and had only one jam and no incomplete insertions. The Grex pins seem to be a harder steel than other pins and have a better finish. I am very satisfied.
1," Amazing!: I really have enjoyed this show. Once I discovered it, I think I watched the entire season in a few days. I love having the video and being able to share it with friends.This show is so entertaining. There is an underlying story that moves from episode to episode, but the main action is fresh and inventive. I can't think of any other show on television that is like this one, it is more like a movie in the set, filming, character development, and acting. This show does not disappoint."
1," Wonderful book, sad ending though: I bought this book just a month ago, I finished reading it a couple of days. I love it, I love the courtroom scenes, and the beautiful and poignant love story of Jennifer and Adam. It is really so sad though, why did their son Joshua have to die? It has a sad ending too, but Jennifer is a survivor.My cousin read it too, she loves it. We both love ""Master of the Game"" too. I have read and enjoyed all Sidney Sheldon novels except ""Tell me your dreams."" I'm planning to buy it yet. He is the best, incomparable."
1," Top of the Line: Audrey Meadows gave a five star performance for her writing in this impossible to put down book. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed every moment of her stories of years ago. Ms. Meadows is a gifted actress as well as author. Her anticdotes are as hilarious as the series. And it's good that she respected all of her fellow actors and actresses while writing her beautiful tales of what went on behind the scenes during the run of the ""Honeymooners""."
0, Ok but could do better for OHMSS: This Bond is my least favorite. Poor George got a bad Bond to start and sank.
1," Best Jigsaw Puzzle I've done in years: This illustration, from the Hildebrandt brothers' 1977 LOTR calendar, makes a superb jigsaw challenge--the artwork is exquisitely detailed and the colors are utterly magical. Just hard enough to be interesting but won't drive you nuts. An excellent choice for jigsaw fans and Tolkien fans alike."
0, cast iron grill: this grill did not meet my requirementsI wanted a grill that was easy clean - this one comes with complicated instructionswe like to use it for defrosting in addition to cooking
0," miniature?: Definitely miniature...I am disappointed. I thought it was miniature in the sense of less pages, as in a abridged story, but wrong---be sure to have your glasses with you if your eyesight is a little weak.Could be good for the car? I don't know but I am disappointed with its size and the price I paid for it."
1," Melinda Armstrong the only thing worth seeing: She commands a presence well here, the pool scene is amazing. I wanted to like the other characters, but there are too many scenes with horrible lighting. Cheesy, humourous, and a good ending. Preferred the second one but this is catchy too. /^^|"
1," Interesting: Akhmatova is an extremely interesting woman, totally devoted to her country and her poetry - and for me this book also gave me a history lesson for that time period in Russian history."
0," Steven's Gone Home...To The Assisted Living Community: I bought this album, along with Brutal Planet, expecting to find Alice at his matured finest. Instead, I was left feeling like I had purchased some garage band Sound Garden meets Metallica meets Puddle of Mudd rip off. There were no clearly defined gutar riffs (where is Davey Johnstone when you need him?), supremely odd chord structures, noises or or weird ghostly effects. Oh, there were maybe one or two good songs that hinted back to Alice in his better days, like This House Is Haunted and Take It Like A Woman. Unfortunately, the rest of both albums were rife with overly heavy guitar and standard hired studio hand drum work, along with tired old references to how Alice got his name, no more mister nice guy, etc. I found both albums geriatrically Alice's worst ever ."
0," Quite weak, in comparison: Too much exegesis. Too much boring talk about revolvers and their various types of ammunition. Not enough of the kinds of characterization that has made Powers.The weakest effort yet. Go read ""Anubis Gates"" or ""Dinner At Deviant's Palace,"" or, if you can find a copy, ""The Drawing of the Dark."" Or even ""Last Call""; it's a far stronger book."
1," Good value for money: I bought this tape after using Ana Caban's beginner mat workout tape... It's much faster than Ana's workout and there is also the implicit assumption that you are familiar with Pilates moves. However, Denise gives great tips as you're doing the exercises and moves quickly from one exercise to another which I like since I've already spent some time mastering the beginner workout. I'd recommend Ana Caban's tape to anybody starting Pilates - she spends a considerable amount of time explaining basic concepts and teaching techniques before starting the workout and even during the workout. This is necessary for beginners and is missing in Austin's video."
0," Disappointing: I love Alan Alda as an actor. But his book is a big disappointment. Two major flaws --1) There is very little about M*A*S*H, the show that made him a star.2) The book is just not very funny. I laughed once -- when he knocked on his Mother's casket as if to say, anyone home?He needed a stronger editor."
0," letter transposition problem makes it unusable for normal typing: like at least one other reviewer, i have a big issue with the keyboard transposing letters as i type. it is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, because i cannot type at my normal speed without continuously backing up to make corrections. in the few minutes or so it has taken me to type this review, i have had to stop and make about 12 corrections.i contacted adesso support, and their response was that ""it happens on all keyboards"". it doesn't. between work and home i have about 20 keyboards from a number of manufacturers, and guess what? none of those keyboards, or any other keyboard i have used since 1980 has had this problem. adesso offered to take it back and send a replacement, but that won't fix the problem. it is a design problem. so i give up. my money is down the drain and i will get another keyboard. it's too bad, because if it weren't for this problem, it would be a great little keyboard."

1," Intimate Look at Phish: I have been a Phish fan for only a couple years, and I really enjoyed this documentary. Actually, I watched it 3 times the first day. It gives a unique perspective on the band and their interactions with each other. My favorite parts were where they were just sitting around goofing off with each other. I think you have to have some prior interest in Phish to enjoy the documentary. I showed it to some friends who don't follow the band, and they weren't all that excited. All in all, a good documentary with funny scenes and good music."
0," A complete waste of time and money!: Pedantic, repetitive, poorly written, littered with factual, grammatical and spelling errors. It seems that the author watched the tv series and ripped off a great number of magazine articles. He admits that this book was rushed, no doubt to capitalize on Ozzy's current resurgence. This belongs at the checkout stand at Safeway for 99 cents."
0," Shades of Blue and Gray: I will not buy a CD over the internet that I can not sample the songs first. Oh well, you lose."
1," Haunting, Flawless Mirage: We hunger for Simoom: that object of intoxicating, addictive, ultimately deadly passion. Simoom, also a Saharan wind, comes from an Arabic word for ""poisonous drug"". But a poison is only dangerous if consumed, and Balzac's caution for lovers is to deny the overpowering need to consume--or possess. Yet perhaps passion is inevitably consuming...This is a lyrical, stunningly well made production of a tale that should have been impossible to film, and lingers in memory as a shimmering mirage. Its attention to detail, even the tack, weapons and tactics of Napoleonic and Mameluke cavalry, its loving caress of the harsh desert landscape itself, its evocation of oppressive sun, heat, thirst, hunger and desperation, all permit the magical human-djinn-leopard relationship to evolve so naturally: heartbreakingly real yet seductively veiled in entrancing ambiguity. ""Passion"" is a flawless jewel that may have been lost in the sands but once found, will haunt you for years."
0," VERY misleading, and poor quality too.: These claim to be ""seamless"" but they aren't really.They are three parts: a panty and two legs.The legs are very carefully stitched into the panty, with no seams visible, but they are not all ""one piece"" as claimed.The first time you pull these up, no matter how careful you are, you are likely to separate a leg or two from the panty.If you are a size A, you might order a size E/F and not have them be ruined, but I doubt it.If you did buy them like that, they would not be very comfortable anyway.Definitely not worth the hassle.On a plus note, the seller refunded my money on all three pairs that I bought, even though one pair was totally ruined.Maybe they had had this same problem with other purchasers before."
0," Untrustworthy: I bought the VN-4100PC to record a long distance phone call, to have a record of the conversation. I got this product specifically for the PC connectivity. It recorded the phone call without problem. But when I connected the device to the PC to upload the files, it erased all the files on the device.This will be returned immediately, but in the meantime I think consumers should be warned."
0," Jesus and Mastership: The gospel according to Jesus of Nasareth: I thought this book is a SHAM: both in product quality and content.Firstly, the cover began coming off in the first hour of reading and I did not treat this book as roughly as most of the books I read, being careful to not bend the spine of this book.Secondly, the story, in my opinion varied little with what is recorded in the Bible and is a far cry from ""A Course in Miracles"" and its newer corollary ""The Disappearance of the Universe"".I was so incensed with the book, I thought I would burn it to keep this drivel from further exposure to an unsuspecting readership. (so rating this product as one star is far too high. )I very much do appreciate Amazon and it services.I do look forward to buying more books in the future."
1, Best collection of SDs Hits: After getting the bug to finally add some Steely Dan to my music ears I finally found one that has 'Josie' on it! Josie is my favorite song of thiers and this seems to be the only one with it on there along with all the others you would expect to find. Get it. Hear it. Love it!
1," Hated to see it end..............: What a wonderful novel! I truly cried with this one! It brought out emotions that I didn't even know I had. As I read on (this is a long one), I felt like I was part of the ""family"" and knew everyone on a personal level. My heart ached for Dr. Larch when Homer left, and when Melony finally came back.....oh boy! This book starts out slow and frankly, at first, I didn't know if I was going to stick with it or not (I did get tired of hearing about the pony picture), but gradually, it kept getting better and better, until it got to the point that I couldn't wait to get back to it every night - there are not too many books like that for me - this is a wonderful story - you will not be sorry to get this one and begin to become part of the orphanage at St. Clouds - truly a heart warming read."
1," The Story Of Moses The Ten Commandments!!: Awesome Movie! very powerful film The Ten Commandments is like reading the book of Exodus but watching it instead it's right down to what the Holy Word of God say's, The story of Moses is one of the best Storys in the Bible along with Christ Jesus and King David, The Ten Commandments is perhapes one of the best films i have ever seen, Also the effects that this movie has is awesome for the time it was made it seems like a 1970's Film when it's a 1956, Moses time takes place 1000 years befor Christ was born making it 3000 years ago, The word Exdous means A WAY OUT as Moses leads Israel out of Egypt in too the Holy Mounten Mount Sinai where The Ten Commandments is writen by the Finger of God!, I highly Recommand this movie it's a True Classic 5 Star, Remaber God loves you more then you could ever imagin God Bless."
1," Techno at it's BEST!: I never cared much for modern music, but after discovering these ladies on YouTube while looking for someone else, I LOVE IT!!! They are an absolutley perfect blend of classical music with a totally modern bend, and they are GREAT! I just purchased my 4th CD of theirs and can't wait for a concert DVD because they are as much a pleasure to look at as they are to listen to! BRAVO, BOND!!!"
1," People don't agree....: People don't agree about this book, and its hard to get a copy! Therefore, I think its probably an important book.In any case, I think DeGaris deserves recognition for articulating the concept that AI-nanotech intelligences will one day populate the universe.Whether these intelligences will like humans, kill humans, or simply be another version of humanity is difficult to say.Kurzweil is more impressive on that topic."
0, not happy: the displayed picture was for a hp cartridge but what was sent was a replacemrnt brand and it took several weeks to arrive so I was very disapointed with the service and product t6hat was shipped
0," OK Western, poor quality tape: I purchased Front Row Entertainment's VHS version of ""Vengeance Valley"" and was bitterly disappointed. The video quality is poor and the sound track is no better. The story, from what I could make of it, is humdrum. If you're a Lancaster fan, however, the movie is worth having in your collection. And if you're a fan of wasting 20 bucks on a poor quality video, this is a tape for you!"
1," Latimore's obscure but soul-soothing Malaco debut set.: Originally released in 1982, this (somewhat) obscure album was Latimore's Malaco debut. Latimore's husky and smoky yet vibrant and heartfelt vocals are truly in peak form on the slow-burn Soul-Blues ballads which are predominant on this CD. As was the case with most Malaco albums of the 1980s, this one was sparsely produced and most of the songs were (obviously) aimed at serious Southern R&B fans--not surprisingly, it failed to get any considerable amount of radio airplay. This is music that soothes the soul, however, and an album well worth checking out."
1, Perfection does exist!: This book is THE most comprehensive book in the non-trauma area of Emergency Medicine. Hopefully Dr. Buttaravoli will continue to keep this excellent latest edition up to date as he has accomplished incredibly well so far. Don't wait one minute to purchase this book!
1," The only sandals you're allowed to wear with socks: These sturdy, supportive, comfortable & extremely versatile sandals are great for public showers, post sports sandals, house shoes... You can even wear them with a thick pair of oatmeal socks for cooler weather. What other sandals can one pull-off wearing socks with? Even if you live in a grey, urban area, the sandals are affordable enough to have a pair for those trips to the beach or warm weather trips to the local park. Love 'em."
1," From a convert: Okay, I'll admit it -- I'm from Halifax, Sloan's homebase, and yet I've never been a fan. Sure, I've heard their earlier recordings, but it took ""Between the Bridges"" and my leaving Nova Scotia to make me realize that this band is terrific. This disc in particular oozes melodious, intoxicating songs. Highly recommended, even for the classical music clan members. A must for Haligonians."
1," Refreshing and Interesting.........: I really enjoyed reading this account of Wall Street ""manipulator"" Jay Gould. I appreciated the personal stories and anecdotes, alot of which were missing from the more scholarly works about this great man. I congratulate the author for his diligence in turning up heretofore overlooked sources for his biography. You come away feeling like you really know Jay as he was, not as he was portrayed by the media of the times, or the numerous authors that rekindled the bias and falsehoods, something that continues, apparently to this day.I also liked that fact that he included the personal histories of the members of Gould's family.Lastly, if you enjoyed Gordon's ""The Scarlet Woman of Wall Street"", this book is a definite addition for your library. You won'' be disappointed."

0," What happen Leslie?: I love Leslie Sansone's walk exercise programs and I have about 4 DVD's. This is the worst. The music is too low to the point you can barely hear it. Everyone seems like they are off beat. I can't even watch them while they move because it throws off my workout. Because you are basically doing the same moves for every workout I think the music should be good and loud enough to hear as well as the people should be on beat. I am in the process of trying to get rid of it via ebay, so if you want it for cheap, check out ebay later this week."
1," Life Ring: This item met all my expectations. It was a terrific purchase and the wife uses it just to float around in the pool. She puts it under her arms and off she goes. Not intended for that, but that gives it a lot more use. I highly recommend this item; it is reasonably priced and it is a very good product. I did not waste my money when I purchased this item; it will last for a very, very long time."
1," This thing's a honey: This little popcorn maker is a real honey. I bought it to replace one I'd had for many years, and this one's an improvement - fewer parts, quite intelligent design. Great for making healthful popcorn"
1, Excellent Series!: I love this whole series. One of my favorites. I find the characters engaging. I can't put these books down.
0," More Drills than 3-4-3: Disappointed in the initial review and the video as it really is a CD of the players doing some drills, a couple of good ones, but that's not what I was looking for. I was hoping it was a more systematic review of the patterns of play and role responsibilites of the players in a 3-4-3. There was a very small segment on a single patter of play moving up the flank but other than that, nothing much. There was a discussion about its merits and also the 4-3-3 - which I coach now - but I wouldn't say I have any better understanding of implementing a 3-4-3 prior to before I watched it. Trying to implement the 3-4-3 was why I bought it so I would have to say it wasn't of great value to me other than the additonal drills."
1," The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai: The word ""harrowing"" in the title only begins to cover what the exiles encountered. The account is well-written and seems very well documented, even to the chilling photo of poor Father Damien on his deathbed...two days before his death.As a child I was aware of the struggles of the lepers of Molokai, and Fr. Damien, because of my Mother's interest and her subscription to the Maryknoll Mission magazine, which, I think now, looking back, must have published many articles regarding this subject matter.I have always wanted to learn as much as possible about the leper colony at Molokai, and now am doing so."
0," Poor description of product: Description didn't state the edition. It is an older version of this book, missing important recent events and updates."
1," if it tastes this bad-its gotta be good for ya!: yea, so this stuff tastes like a root should. nasty. i mix it in with protein shakes, and then essentially gulp it down with a horrible scrunched look on my face. I definitely feel improved energy -which i never have of!- a welcome addition to my sometimes lacking diet."
1," gold and garbage: The good stories (Laughing Man, Esme, Dinghy) are tens.The bad stories (Bananafish, Green My Eyes) get negatives."
1," VERY COOL!: I like the variation on this CD. From ""Baby's Got Back"" to one of my favorite oldies ""Turning Japanese"" all the way up to the songs ""Independant Women Pt. 1"" and ""Dot"" featuring the new member of Destiny's Child, Michelle. Overall, it's a great listen through the decades- right up to now! It's an ultra cool soundtrack from an ultra cool movie."
1," Excellent Resource: ""The 36 Hour Day"" was a valuable resource for me when I was caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's Disease. I have purchased several of them as gifts for friends who are facing similar situations. I highly recommend this book."
0," too basic: I was very disappointed in this DVD. The moves they teach, as few as they were,my grandmother could perform. You require no coordination at all. The majority of this DVD was was filled with testimonials from the students that said how great the DVD was and how sexy they felt. It isn't even worth considering."
1," Kitchen Craft Kitchen Kutter: This is the most wonderful tool since the electric food processer! It is manual, but very easy yo use and clean up is a breeze. I make a vegetable slaw using 1/4 Wedge of both white and red cabbage with cone 2, 1 carrot using cone 4, 1 Zucchini using cone 5, 1 Yellow Squash using cone 5, 1 Cucumber using cone 5, 1 Large celery stalk using cone 1, a 1"" to 2"" slice of butternut squash using cone 1, 1/4 Wedge of yellow onion using cone 2. Grine all ingredients into a bowl, toss and eat with your favorite salad dressing. I like to use a rasberry vinegrette. I keep this tool on my countertop all the time therefre I use it nearly everyday. You will not regret buying this tool, especially if you love fresh salads and veggies. Of course I have to admit that I got this tool free for buying a set of Luster Craft cookware made by West Bend."
0, Rubbish: This coffee maker has made exactly one pot of coffee and then died. A completely useless piece of junk that I would not recommend to my worst enemy. Do not buy this product. If someone gives it to you as a gift -- return it.
1," Great Job AGAIN!!!!: You guys again did a great job on this book! I owned your previous version for SQL Server 7 and thought it was great and wrote a great review. Subsequently when the next version came out, I received an email from either Paul Conte or Michael Conte asking me if I wanted a complementary copy of the new book. Of course I said yes (sorry Amazon, I didn't buy the 2000 version from you) and it arived ASAP. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to use SQL Server 2K until about a week ago and have found the book invaluable since then. It is not a book for beginners, however, it is written in a straight forward manor and is enjoyable to read (how many technical books can you say are enjoyable to read?) and gives me the info I need to develop apps. utilizing SQL Server. Thanks again for a great, well written technical book!!!"
0," What a joke: I rarely am so displeased with a product that I'll go out of my way to write a negative review of it. In this case I'm that displeased. The noise canceling technology of these headphones consist of ""white noise"" generated in the headphone speakers, intended to drown out other sounds. Great idea, but if I want to listed to the hiss of white noise I'll hold a seashell up to my ear and tell myself I can hear the ocean. Replacing one type of noise with another is not helpful."
1," More great acoustic sambas from Da Vila: This is his third album from 1971... and it's really pretty, like all of his stuff. Recommended!"
0," Are you...: Ok first off I'm not a Zeppelin hater, Zeppelin 2 is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I think everyone should own it. I also love the work they did after this album with Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti. But this album is so bad it makes me sick. The people who wrote these reviews giving this album 5 stars are either... or totally consumed with the image brought on by the name of the band. Not everything this band recorded was good, no matter what their millions of worshipers say. And nothing proves that point more than listening to this album. So if you're looking for a Zeppelin album I suggest buying either Houses of the Holy or Led Zeppelin 2. But no matter what you do leave this piece of trash on the shelf because trust me you will be disappointed."
1," great flick: If you are an inventor or even want to be one then this is the movie for you. Sadly its less about the industry than it lends itself, but more about making amends and moving forward."
0," Very simple: Professional to Expert? Only an overview on the j2ee.I am wondering about the contents of the ""beginner to professional"" book...Give it a try if u want to have a light explanation on j2ee key tecs.Example: the chapter Using EJB Container Services starts from page 621 and ends at page 653. Everyone knows that arguments like Security services, Transaction Services, Scheduling, Instance pooling and caching worth more than 30 pages...J2EE bible is still the best tutorial/reference for a professional."
0," No ending: There were two reasons I bought this DVD, one being that I'm very interested in ""Sideshow Freaks"", so I really wanted to see the sisters. The other that I really wanted to know how they would punish the other sister in the movie.But there is no ending, there's just a man that simply tells you that you have to decide for yourself what you think the punishment should be.Very dissapointing!The acting isn't very good, especially not the sisters. The blonde one sounds bored when she should say ""I'm so happy!"".The good parts were the performances on stage, I especially thought the guy on the bicicle was cool.The sisters singing is good, it's so sad that the sound quality was so bad!The plot was good, even though the sisters didn't act good, it did told how hard it can be to always be stuck together."
0," Second half is just boring: Books becomes increasing boring with each chapter. Sexual content (lesbian, 13 year old girls) is increasingly added for no apparent reason. Many chapters are just people sitting around telling stories about things that have nothing to do with series. If this was the first book in the series,GRR Martin would not have been heard of- this book is that bad."
1, Panasonic KX-TG2770: Have had total of 3 systems. Generally work well. The WORST part is the OEM NICAD battery. It is HORRIBLE. Buy the Energizer NIMH replacement on e-bay. It is MUCH better battery. ADDED August 2010: Panasonic has now a much better battery that fits. HHR-P402 Ni-MH. Phones still available on E-Bay. Still using all our phones.
1," What ! A HAND SCREW CLAMP.: When I was in high school 33 years ago,I used jorgensen clamps.HAND SCREW AND BAR CLAMPS.THEY are the BEST.Then when I was a carpenter in the shop I used them.I guess you can say I had a life long love for jorgensen clamps."
1, Park&Sun: This volleyball set is pretty good. The only thing I dislike about it are the four stakes that hold down the side ropes. The stakes are pretty cheap but you can always buy bigger and bettter ones elsewhere. The quality of the net and poles are there and I would recommend this net to those who love the game of volleyball. The ball that comes with the set is no good but if you play at a competitive level then you should already have a better ball.
0," many names, but very little story: A Feast for Crows is a great disappointment. It focuses largely on minor characters, and despite the great length of the novel, very little happens. There is much travelling, but not much happens on arrival. More and more characters are introduced, more and more names, lengthy genealogies,"
1," collected works of John Dowland: This is a fine recording of John Dowland's music, and worth your time if you are an early music enthusiast. The biggest highlights are the vocal recordings done by Emma Kirkby, who has a wonderful soprano voice that is perfect for the style of music. The solo lute recordings are also very nicely done, and highlight the lute's unique texture - these recordings do not sound like a guitar. I highly recommend this collection."
0," Good Theory, but not a practise book: This is a well written and concise booklet. Learned a lot of the practical theory behind the 5 Elements Chi Kung. The only problem is that there is only 5 or so small pictures of the actual practice session for each of the 5 Element forms so as an instruction guide its next to useless. This book is not for the user, whether beginner or advanced. There is no dvd media which is essential if you are serious about these sets of forms. There is a website in Taiwan which alludes to available media but no links to it. Courses are offered in Taiwan which is impractical for most people. So, I don't rate it that much considering there are lots of other decent media out there for these forms"
0," Cracked: I ordered this to hang on the end of my Ikea changing table (as a few reviewers have noted, if you have a combination changing table/dresser, this may not work for you). Unfortunately, it arrived and was cracked and crushed at the top. So, I sent it back and requested a replacement. AGAIN, cracked. So I sent that back and asked for a refund. I found the same product (for $14, a little bit more but not terrible) at Babies R Us. I opened two boxes at the store to inspect them and BOTH were cracked or chipped. I don't know if this is because of the type of pastic being used, a defective batch from the factory, or simply bad luck on my part. But, I am going to pass on this product although it seemed like it would have worked well otherwise. Disappointing."
0, too thin!: i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have. yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far.all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds). i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap.
0," Tedious: A preposterous plot, an unlikable protagonist, set in a relentlessly depressing context.....why did I finish this book? The author is obviously intelligent, but it doesn't make this book worth reading. Save your eyesight!"
1, Good product but not for small ears: This is really a great headset in terms of sound quality and overall. The noise cancelling/wind reduction feature makes a big difference. My only reservation was that it was bulky and heavy on the ear if you have small ears like me. It kept falling off and so I was adjusting it so much that it became dangerous to have on since I was fumbling with it more than i would if I was holding the cell phone by itself. I recommend the Plantronics Discovery 610 if you don't like anythng wrapped around your ear.Overall good product though. Volume was a bit hard to adjust if it was on your ear though.
1," Where Clapton And Many Others Came From: Jimmie Vaughn, once a Fabulous Thunderbird, called Freddie King ""a gunslinger."" Meaning that he'd take anybody on, on any terms, and come out on top. That's probably why Vaughn, Clapton, and most straightforwardly Peter Green (from the original Fleetwood Mac) chose Freddy as a model for their guitar work. If you're looking for the highest expression of Texas blues guitar, you have to include this recording in your search. (And if you're really into it, you better pick up some Albert Collins and T. Bone Walker, too...)"
1," Tana: I fear that the short time between this album and Reise, Reise, made this album suffer a bit. It feels a little ... rushed.That being said, the album is worth the purchase. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it.There is only one bad song ""tiera de puta"" or whatever the hell crap song that is, and the rest of it is pretty good. A lesser of all of their albums, but Rammstein has yet to put out a lousy release."
0," dreadful video ""quality"": Terrible, choppy playback.We have very fast internet and wifi in our house. No reason at all for the quality to be soooooo bad.Stick with Netflix for streaming."
1," Break down the Can'ts of your life: This book was a message to poor souls that have been caught up in the ""I can't"" attitude. It tells you to be patient and look for answers and keep looking when you are told there are none. With that comes the perception of hope."
0," Cheap piece of junk: Fell apart right out of the box, looks and feels like a 20 dollar timex. Waste of time and money."
0," Over-indulgent: The playing on the album is superb, however the material is totaly over-indulgent and very unaccessable. Complex for the sake of being complex. No where near as good as Falling into Infinity."
0," Not Enough Australia: Being a big fan of The Thorn Birds, I was hoping for a novel set mainly in Australia. But after 300-plus pages with the protagonist still in England, I just couldn't muster the interest to finish."
1," The truth is; we are all trying to get our kites in the air!: What if this story were an American tale? Would you as the reader still give it those same reviews? What if it is a true story of boys and men growing and fighting against religious oppression and an economic cast system in the United States of America.Go back and re-read it, it may open your eyes to a world of subtle shadows and nuance that could only come from literature written and published in a free society, and, will we ever really be free to address the painful truths that this book speaks about?"

1," As always, full of interesting information and facts: I would give this calendar five stars except that I'm not crazy about the artwork. But since I've been buying the Witches' Calendar every year since I figured out that I'm a Witch, obviously I'm more than willing to overlook the artowrk. Every month there is an interesting article and there are notations of dates that are of interest to Witches'."
1," TomTom GO 720: Up to now I have been 'old school' and have relied on paper maps and mapquest to get me where I needed to go. A friend recommended this unit and I added it to my Christmas wish list. Fortunately for me my wife bought the unit and I have been very pleased and satisfied. I really cannot compare it to other devices since this is my first, but so far it has passed every test I have given it with flying colors. Very easy to use and very trustworthy to get you where you are going fast and efficient. I have learned new routes in the Houston area that I would have never considered to be the best route, but in every instance I have saved time and miles by using the GO 720."
0, Nonip: This catnip did not grow for me. I ended up getting little plants from the local garden shop and those grew just fine.
1," Looking forward to more...: I read through S.C. in two days. It reads like lightning. Very smart, but very quick prose. Anne Ursu does not try to jam emotion down your throat or tell you what you should be feeling. In this way it was like a piece of theater. You are presented with these highly identifiable human beings and the understanding is left up to you. This makes the book highly engaging and explains why I got so involved that the novel was finished nearly before I looked up.The book is only now becoming available, but early buzz about Spilling Clarence in our area is very good, and as an early reader I can say it's well deserved."
0, Predictable and boring.: This book read like a rahashed screen play 20 years old. Not nearly as good as his more modern novels.
0," Moonie Propaganda: Another disreputable hit-piece from the Moonie-owned hard right propganda organ, The Washington Times. I have to make a confession - I was unable to finish this book. The usual stale right-wing stew of distortion, obfuscation, ommission, half-fact and outright lie perfected, and subsequently exposed, by David Brock (see Blinded by the Right), made my gorge rise too much to read on.If you are a fan of a certain well-known porcine pundit, famed for his fact-impaired rants against liberals, ""feminazis"" and anyone to the left of Attila the Hun, I'm sure you'll love this rancid polemic - otherwise, stay well clear...."
1," 24"" ruler: Excellent product for someone who doesn't need it for woodworking. The measuring increments begin after a 1/8 "" gap. You must subtract 1/8 "" from any measurement and in the heat of battle you may forget to make that correction. The result is a fine piece of wood that won't fit your project.Th ruler is very thin enough so that it will bend into an arc."
1," My Girls fight over this one!: We bought this for our two girls, ages 1 and 2 who absolutely love fish. They fight over who gets to swing in it first. Although I agree that it's for smaller toddlers or babies, my 2 year old, who is average-sized, still fits in it. Next year, we'll have to move her up to a big-girl swing, but the dolphin will still be going strong for the younger one. If I had to change anything about this, it would be to lenghten the ropes approx 6-9 inches. But overall, it's a wonderful swing."
0," Great for weather updates, horrible for communication: I used brand new Duracell batteries with these radios, and the reception was still horrible. We had to repeat ourselves about 5 times for the other person to understand what we were saying. The only good (nay, excellent) thing about these radios is the weather updates. Perfect for camping, especially when you see flashes of light in the distance (turns out where we were camping had a severe thunderstorm watch, which turned to a warning while we were leaving at 2 AM). Possibly saved our lives, because the next day it was reported that someone else who was camping nearby got struck by lightning. However, there are other things available for that purpose. These things are junk for 2-way radios, but lifesavers for weather warnings."
0," Not her best...: I am a Celtic music fan since a long time.Love Enya, Loreena McKennit and such. But mainly CLANNAD. Great band, great atmospheres.I bought this album 2 years ago and to me it s not a great album. Apart a cople of nice tracks and her beautiful voice, this album is far away from what Clannad had to say. It s not very ""celtic"", it has some mixture of pop as well. Not her kind. Well, if you like TWO HORIZONS, well MAA is completely different.If you haven't yet, get a chance to listen to TWO HORIZONS and you will find the real MOYA. She is superb."
1, Delicious Recipes: This book has many delicious recipes to serve for breakfast or brunch. Great when you have overnight guests.
0," ..Bloody Awful': If you have never seen or heard of the Rolling Stones you might be able to sit thru this. Otherwise this is one of those fake paste up jobs that mostly only sell on Amazon. It's all pieced together footage from the public domain and still images from the other 100 Stones books. The worst part are the narrators. A bunch of cheesy old has beens in search of a payday. And to a one they are bloody awful, at both reading and speaking. The one old ungroomed fart actualy....talks..... about......this.....fast....for....quite.......some........time. We see a 20 second clip of Mick Taylor speaking. That's about it for him. .Poor John Mayall narrates a bit and is as interesting as yesterdays coffee cup. No one deserves to steal your money like this. If you must have it, please find someplace to rip it for free on line. I think I will have a look at Amazons return policy."
1," Makes Quilting Easy: My grandmother loved to quilt and I remember hours spent watching her make these fabulous pieces of art. Since her death, I have regretted not having joined her in her creative endeavor, and found this book to be not only informative but it helped take the struggle out of this art. I finished my first one, now onto my second. Great book!"
0," Nothing Stands Out: This album is very bland with no energy or pep whatsoever. All the songs just sound like filler to have a reason to release another title. ""Something Worth Leaving Behind"" and ""Forever Every Day"" are great songs, but the rest is not."
1," Works even on tiny embedded ticks!: Originally bought this at my Vet's office. It works like a charm! There is a little divot in the spoon that works like the forked part of a hammer head to pull out any size tick. I use these in clinic to pull ticks off patients (human kind!). I even successfully removed a entire seed tick the other day. I am buying one for every exam room, my house and car."
1," Love it: Really happy with this product so far. Works well in hot and cold weather, is accurate, and easy to use."
1," Bamboo iPhone Case: Great case, fits well, people notice the wood, kind of an ""organic"" aspect to the iPhone. Keeps it from being so slippery also."
1," good phone for the price: Truely, this is a great phone at this price.. Bluetooth works great with my laptop.. Nokia has a good support.. The only flaws with this phone were the following,1. the keys are in circle and difficult to use for SMS etc.2. the ringing is not as loud as of Motorola or Ericcson.3. the speaker phone is also not too loud. Can hear it when noise around u is less.4. sometimes the phone switches off by itself.5. the GPS service for AT&T is not having a good coverage."
0," Won't print: I am not satisfied with these cartridges. For some reason, once installed, my printer would not print. I still hope it will eventually work...."
1," Great Storytelling!: This is one of the best books I've read in quite some time. The author truly brings you up-close to the trials and tribulations of her mother and daughter. The book keeps you fully engrossed in the situations and makes you wonder how Ms. Tilden-Mortimer managed to get through life with all the heartbreak. While the book deals with sorrow, it is written in such a way that it's not very heavy-handed and even humorous at times. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been a caregiver and to those who may have to be one in the future. Kudos for a great book after a hard life. I hope Ms. Tilden-Mortimer's future proves to be full of good times to make up for the past."
0," WORST DVD I'VE EVER PURCHASED: I just purchased this DVD because the store was partically giving it away (9.99) and let me say I still feel cheated. This movie is your typical clone,lets make a movie about a holiday(Valentines Day) and cash in on it. First its got your typical crazy man just like crazy Ralph in Friday The 13th and also has a guy wearing a mask(a miners mask to be exact)and it uses the same theme as the prowler(another ... film,but I won't go there),its about a guy Harry Walden who has been decieved on Valentines Day left in a mine and later returns. Not to mention this movie was so cut and edited I would show it to my parents at dinner. Parmount has done another horrible job with another DVD,no extras,not even a trailer. ... ... MOVIE WITH NO PLOT,NO GORE,AND NO EXTRAS,NOT EVEN THE ORIGINAL COVER ART JUST LIKE THE FRIDAY THE 13th FILMS ON DVD,THIS IS AS HORRID AS SCREAM SERIES,I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.,AND VALENTINE(THE [re-make] OF THIS ... MOVIE)"
1," Unique: Great album. Rick Astley has a voice like no other. All of his hits are on this disc. Although the import version of this album has bonus tracks, it also has single and edited versions of songs that are in their orginial form on this version. This album is a must have for any Rick Astley fan."
0, I hate this toy!: This toy dosn't even work! I hate it so much! Do not buy this! I got this on my 7th Birthday and it dosn't even work. I hate it.
0," too good to be true..: I guess the saying is ture, you get what you pay for. But I still think a seller should be HONEST in their description to save us the trouble of purchasing, mailing back, and waiting for a refund.These earrings should not have been described as SI2-I1. There were a few black specks in the diamonds that were VERY visable to the naked eye. Not alot of sparkle in them, but I would've kept them if they didn't have the black specks.They did provide a full refund,so i guess I can't complain too much."
1, Fantastic: With 36 pages (like having 36 memory cards) of memory it is the best thing I bought for my playstation. You never need to worry about running out of memory again. Well worth the price.
0," This book goes into the recycling bin.: Shame to Julian Barbour for publishing a book that has ""physics"" in the title, but not one single equation! Where are the new ideas? Not in this book, for sure. Save your money!"
1," Good Story Idea, An Average Script, Great Acting: This is an example of a movie that has an average script but is saved by the acting. Not only Sissy Spacek, who can elevate any script, but also Art Carney and Jane Wyatt of TV's ""Father Knows Best"" fame make it a moving film experience. It could have been a self-pitying liberal mess but is actually a pretty good examination of what happened to make some American upper middle class white kids become America-hating anarchist bombers in the 1960s."
1," It Really Works: This belt really is a great buy. It definitely makes you sweat, focuses on your mid section and and back fat. It's great for walking/running the track or your treadmill. I am 31 inches in the waist. I did have to remove and replace one zipper to make it snugger. If you don't have a sewing machine, the dry cleaner will move your zippers for a custom fit. Enjoy"
1," something's bogus, dudes: This is a simple movie, not made to be dissected, competed with or watched for the plot or action. rather, the film provides a taste of SoCal that is partly mythical and partly disappearing and for that alone i loved it.there's something wholesome about the film, left me feeling good which does not happen too often for me, and almost never with the large commercial blockbusters. to see Willie Nelson's smile, that alone was worth waiting for. mcConnaughey does a good job, as does Harrelson & most of the crew.in other words, this is not about surfing. it is about friendship and about knowing what you love."
1, Awsume: I liked it so much. It is a bit scary at the end but then again it's classic Harrison Ford. Good movie!
0, too much water gets out of the shower: it looks good and appears to be good quality upon arrival. but there is too much water on the floor after a shower and once the rust and the mildew set in it's difficult to keep at bay. not purchasing this again.
0," Lost it's steam: I purchased this DVD and was looking forward to... I guote ""erotic, poetic, filled with romanticism"" There was very little interaction between Mehmet and Francesco.(two male stars) There was a very brief scene between them. If you're going to purchase this movie for poetic romanticism it wasn't there. The movie is very high quality as far as camera technique, and the scenery is excellent. The actors are all believable and well cast."
0, shoe buckle broke after one wear.: I cant believe after one use the buckle broke on these shoe. I was upset and had to spend more to get them repaired.
1," The best diet help book.: This book is the best for someone that has health issues or just wanting to just go on a diet to loose weight..It gives you choices of foods to eat, prepared or foods you prepare your self at home, going out to fast food places, restaurants...This was a book a dietitian at the hospital used to show me how to make life choices...If your counting carbs, fats, calories this is the book to buy..."
1," tropical children's book: I have always liked Lear's rhymes, especially this one, but more than the rhyme, it's the illustrations in this version that I like. We live in Florida and all our sub-tropical and tropical flora and fauna is in this book, beautifully illustrated and very recognizable to my 3 year old daughter. Following along with the secondary story of the two damsel fish (I think they're damselfish, but if they're not, the fault is my fish identification skills, not Brett's illustration) is really fun for her too. A bit further south, but still full of recognizable plants for us Floridians, is another of Jan Brett's books, ""The Umbrella."""
1," great for the 5 year old: my 5 year old son picked this out in march at the library...apparently a little late on the halloween thing...but we read it every night and now he reads it to me...and now i'm buying it because he loves it so...the story's pretty funny and kinda underlines the whole ""there's no such things as spooks"" idea...good times all around..."
0," Disappointing: I always thought that a decoder ring was something that you got out of a box of cracker jacks. But Minasi's offering is no prize.The problem: Minasi tries to cover every popular distribution of Linux in just 500 pages. He generalizes, much to the frustration of the novice user.Indeed, there is useful information contained within ""The Secret Decoder Ring"" , but as the reader you often feel that you need a decoder ring to find it."
0," 40-FD10 part WILL NOT work for a 2009 Ford Focus: The 40-FD10 part WILL NOT work for a 2009 Ford Focus. You will need the 40-CR10 (which I bought on Amazon for about $10)Marked down only because the information included does not help a buyer determine if it fits their car. So I am stuck guessing and most likely stuck losing the money, because the return cost negates getting my money back for the part."
1, Best 3D Math Primer: I have at least 3 books about math for computer graphics and games. This is the best one by Far. It also has extra information summarize that is found in other books but better explained.Buy it
0, Poor quality: The tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up. The landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself. Not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine. Main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect. Final thought.... After several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix I managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds. If you want an R/C helicopter try the Japanese made Hirobo XRB SR.
1," Who thought of this?!?!?!: More than anything I find this little guide to be extremely creative. Unfortunately, when life's troubles come along, I don't immediately remember to whip out my ""MG guide to life"" but I have read some very useful tips in there that I will never forget and some have certainly come in handy at times. If you already know how to cook everything, clean everything, fix anything....you might still even like this book just because of it's good humor and because the author clearly put a lot of time and thought into it. I think every modern girl should have one and it makes a perfect gift for friends. I can't wait to get the modern girl's guide to motherhood once I become a parent!"
1," WOW!!!: I'm still in complete awe of this movie. This is by far, the best DVD I have ever bought. This sooooooooo surpased the oringinal and has the greatest ending in history. Trilogy please?"
0, damaged DVD: I didn't get to watch the film because the dvd was very warped I tried to bend it back to normal but it ended up cracking and breaking. Hopefully this is not the condition of all of this films dvd and I just got stuck with a dud. I will try to purchase this film again or by the book.
0, Disappointed: Maybe because the first two seasons set the bar impossibly high? Season one was a complete surprise that kept my wife and I laughing and season two a better surprise because of its risk taking and dark ending. Season three I found not very deep/substative and many episodes rather boring. Maybe my expectations for season three were too high? The only episode I truly liked in season three was the last one. Maybe because it connected so much with the past seasons? Waiting for season four and hoping it surprises me in a good way.
0," Scratched Merchandise and No C.S.: This product arrived scratche and the customer service would do nothing about a replacement. They have ignorged emails and phone calls and refuse to a) take the product back for a refund, or b) replace the product with a non-defective case. I would not recommend getting one of these cases and definately not through antonline.com"
1, Good book for basic SAT vocabulary...: I purchased this book for an exchange student that we are hosting. His English teacher recommended it. This book is good for basic vocabulary and spelling. Its strait forward and serves it's purpose.
0," it was terrible!: I bought the soundtrack of Ever After hoping to actually hear WORDS!!!!!! Instead, it's completely instrumental, except for the last song by a state(Texas)! It was the worst! I don't reccomend it. WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
1, Use it daily: I love the flavor! I make it like a hot tea and use it every night. It is the only thing that helps me sleep!
1," A Stellar Compilation by the Queen!: When you consider that Rock and Roll was only a part of Wanda Jackson's musical output, finding a good retrospective of her work in that genre is a challenge. This CD meets and exceeds this challenge with a 30-song roundup that is simply outstanding. Those who are looking more for Jackson's country music recordings should look elsewhere, but those who want just the rock and roll should be very happy with this collection. I easily rate this one 5 stars for the music, but I would have liked to see a track listing that included the musical personnel."
1, Great film!: Loved this movie! Get the tissues ready. The bond between man and animal is so strong! Based on a true story too!
1," A Good Bottle: Let me start by saying my son has had no problem switching between bottle and breast. From the very beginning he wanted his food and didn't care how he got it. But, I've noticed that even the stage one nipple is too fast for him. He chokes and gags on this bottle. But, then again I've yet to invest in a bottle system. I've bought at least one of every bottle, except Dr. Browns - hoping someone will buy me some for my baby shower!I've not noticed a lot of bubbles in this. I have the VentAire bottles too and I've not noticed any difference in gas or colic. However, my son thus far seems to prefer the VentAire. I think because this nipple is just too fast for him.I think all babies are different don't invest in any one system. Let your baby decide...because ultitmately thats what is going to happen anyway!"
1," UN. . . believable!: This book shines, a marvelous addition to any collection . If monkeys, muscle cars, defunct superheroes, and crazy bio-mechanical thingies are your bag, then you gotta get two. A real page turner. It will keep you guessing until the very end, and then some."
0," Kindle version has no illustrations: I was looking for a nice illustrated version of the Tao Te Ching for my Kindle. Unfortunately the Kindle version lacks the calligraphy and photographs of the print version, and as the sample only includes the introduction (a common problem with this type of book) it's impossible to find this out before buying. Luckily it's easy to return Kindle content for a refund."
1," This Oil Is Absolutely ""Essential"" in My House!: I am extremely disappointed that it's out of stock at the moment, since I use this with almost every laundry load and around the house! I have a male cat that likes to ""improve"" the scent of dirty clothes with his own special markings - but a few drops of lavender oil in the laundry rinse water eliminates all traces of odor. It's the ONLY thing I have ever found to work that I'm comfortable using on my clothes. I also use it with all the sheets and linens, which if I air-dry, have a wonderful lavender scent when I climb in bed. After a stressful day, it's the perfect calming additive to a bubble-bath, and can be added to sweeten the smell of natural cleaners like vinegar, used to clean soapscum from the tub. It also appears to have some antibiotic and antifungal properties, from what I've observed. Please restock this!!!!!"
0," A Really Annoying CD: Ok, first of all, why ruin the songs with little kids singing over them? Why don't you just make a mix of those songs WITHOUT the kids?!? And also, the music videos with the kids are really stupid and annoying. Most of them don't even have the real subject of the song in them! So in conclusion, this Cd totally SUCKS!!!"
1," I'm crazy for ""Still Crazy"": Love this film. The acting, the plot, the script and the music are all first rate. I don't know what took me so long to purchase this DVD. One of my top 5 R and R films. ""Hard Days Night"", ""Help"", ""Woodstock"", and ""Spinal Top"" make up this list."
1, Great for old pc upgrade: I fix a lot of computers and this one was really slow and I recommended RAM and this was the perfect match
0," Why was this book written?: I finally found the book that should never have been written. The book was given to me, so I tried to read it. Why would anyone waste their time comparing Tom Clancy's novel hero against real life presidents and presidental polices? I have concluded that the author must be jealous of Clancy's success and thought he could make a little money writing a book comparing a fictitious character virsus real presidental policy. This book really deserved a minus star."
0," Worst album....ever: Worst album, pure bubble-gum pop... The only song that's good is Emotional and the other are horrible, awful, and horrendous. The lyrics are childlish, not inspirational at all. Not much emotion put into the song...A really forgettable album...Wouldn't buy it even if it's free... 2 thumbs down... Too bad for Diana XD"
0," Beautiful toy with a major flaw: The barn is lovely - with great animals, BUT the hinges broke the first time it was picked up by my son. We tried to fix it, but the wood at that point is too thin. My son is very gentle on toys - this is the first he has broken - so it is definately a design fault."
1, Great!: This is a great album and I really look forward to listening to it on my way home from work int he evenings :)
1," Good quality vinyl mattress protector: I found this mattress protector to be very high quality, especially for the low price! The vinyl is heavy and soft."
0, just aaight: couple mcs had skills. many didn't.no known names outside of tunnel rats (rather unknown themselves).couple ok bboys. i'd give the continuity a 2 and editing a 2 out of 5. much better out there. check freestyle on palm pictures.
1," This is really only part 1: For devoted Peters fans, this book is hard to read: well-loved characters are put through Hell, and it has an ambiguous ending.New readers of this book need to realize that it's not really a stand-alone novel. It's volume one of a two-volume book, with HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY the second part."
0, T3 overnight hair dryer: I received this hair dryer .... plugged it in and it started smoking.... It also started to smell as if something was burning.... what a disappointment
1, Elmo cd: I purchased this cd for my grandson and he just loves it!! He has hours of fun with it. I would purchase more in the future.Cindy D
0, Disappointing: I've had an infrared thermometer for years and have enjoyed it's ease of use and accuracy. When someone on my Christmas List asked for one I thought it would be a great gift. I was sorely disappointed with my selection in this one. Look for something better.
0," Is this the same author who wrote book 1?: I don't think that it is the same author who started the series. There was more time spent describing what everyone was wearing than there was advancing the plot! Not a single trolloc, myrdraal, battle, or discovery in the entire book. The only bright spot was the interaction between Tuon and Mat, other than that I'm horribly disappointed. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably read this book, if you have only read the first few, don't expect this to follow in the footsteps of the early part of the series. If Mr. Jordan cares about his fans, he will get back to what brought us all in in the first place; action, plot advancement, new discoveries, and a light at the end of the tunnel."
0," Skip It: I agree with the reviewer who writes that it is just an ad for 'tachyon' products. It is dense and pseudo-scientific throughout and tries to separate itself from all the excellent books about energy by proclaiming 'tachyon' energy as somehow different and fundamental to all other kinds, when at the core all energy is one and is known by many names.About the chakras and the meridians (again referencing earlier reviewer): the book Energetic Anatomy by Mark Rich shows very clearly the connections between the two - acupuncture points are like very tiny chakras. This book is a much more valuable reference if you are interested in what can be done with energy.Overall, spend your money elsewhere."
1," I wish I could afford 2: I recently purchased one of these after extensive research. Since we have a two story home, I find myself moving it back and forth. The only downside is the size. It's about the size of a medium dog carrier. But the fact that it is so quiet and works so well, make it worth it. My husband and I both smoke and our house smells fresh and clean for the first time in several years. His mother, a non-smoker, is even amazed. Next year I will definately be buying another one. You don't even know it's running on low and when I turn it up, it's still fairly quiet and non-distracting."
0," Nice phone but horrible signal!!!: This is a cool phone, easy to use and all the features are nice and easy. The worst part is reception. I had many phones before and never such a bad signal. Inside the building-forget about it in most situations. Trees, rain -everything is on the way!!!Do not recommend if you like to know that someone is calling you or texting right a way, and not wait until you will get a reception. !"
0, Another jab at Christian faith from a cultured despiser: I'll pass. The man who used to be A.N. Wilson is a sad fellow
0," Obviously Written by Intellectuals for Intellectuals: I love the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It was one of those books that I tried to read years ago but was simply not ready for it. After a recent conversation with a friend that mentioned the book, I decided to pick up a copy and read it. This time I was ready.After my second reading Of ZMM, I decided to purchase Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. My hope was to deepen my understanding.I gave up on reading Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance about half way through Section 8 (Critical Reviews). This book seems obviously written by intellectuals for intellectuals. Maybe it will be one of those books I will pick up again when I'm ready. For now, I'm not ready."
1," A Must Read: For anyone who has tried and tried and tried to either understand, make peace with, or HOPE an angry/controlling man will CHANGE... YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.... Reading this book has started me on a path to being in charge of my own life for the first time in many years. This book is clear and concise yet its message is very powerful. Angry and Controlling men are very very difficult to live with and almost impossible to change--why should they??--they almost ALWAYS get what they want one way or another. Their sense of entitlemant and almost total lack of empathy makes them very poor choices for a loving and respectful relationshp. The author addresses the dynamics of living with an angry and controlling man in a honest, direct manner borne of a lot of experience. It is easy to read, understand and; unfortunately for some of us, easy to identify with.Reading this book is very affirming and validating to women who live with and endure someone who is angry and controlling."
1, rate my shaver: my shaver gives a closer shave than w/dbl bladed razor and soap and I expect to use only it in the future
1," Good product: I haven't used it much, but so far it looks good. Easy to install, works as described and it comes with free case. I liked the case."
1," Terrific kitchen appliance!: Bought this appliance 20 years ago (yes, 20). It went with me when I moved to Virginia, Italy, Germany and then back to the Pacific Northwest. I use it constantly. It has always been very dependable and does a great job mixing everything from whipped cream to bread dough. It's very easy to clean and all the parts are dishwasher safe. I have nearly every attachment for it, but the things I use the most are the wire whip, bread hook and flat whip. Slashguard comes in very handy as well. Yeah, definately get the splashguard - especially when you've got a lot of flour in the bowl!"
0," Oh, boy: This is definitely rock bottom for rap. Ever since 2Pac died, it seems that more and more untalented writers have become huge rap stars. What is so amazing about a terrible bass line and some guy who should be working at McDonald's screaming ""DANGER!"" and then going off into complete gibberish. Man, I miss people like 2Pac who are extremely talented writers, and could actually be understood! Do yourself a favor, don't get this CD."
0," Like all the rest...: The movie was like most teen movies. In the movie, Melissa Joan Hart tries to get her next door neighbor to go to a dance with her to make both of their exes jealous. Not very original, huh?"
1, Enjoyed this one more than the others.: The author is getting better as she goes along:) I am glad I started this series. I would recommend it to others.
0, Hannity is anti-American: This mindless loser and those like him are dangerous and anti-American forces that are helping to hasten the demise of America. Please: register to vote and help remove Bush and nullify the destructive influences of the likes of Sean Hannity. The future of America depends on thse people being defeated.
1," Versatile: We had a local hardware store ""going out of business"" sale with these lanterns for $10.00 each. I bought one and a friend bought the other. Recently I attached mine to my porch swing frame and tried to find a matching one for the other side. My friend sold me the one he bought and now there are matching lanterns on each side of my covered porch swing. They make such a nice gentle flickering light at night with no worry of needing to blow out the candles. The clamp holder is designed to slip out of the lamp base so you can use it as a table lamp without the pole clamp attatchment for a cleaner look.Yesterday I discovered I saved the box it came in and now I know it's brand name. Before when I was searhing for it online, I had no clue as to the manufacturer because mine had no identifying labels or stamps anywhere on it. (Glad I saved the box for recommendation purposes)It's a nice sturdy, versatile and good looking lamp."
0," More stinky, less sticky.: This tape is not very sticky. It's terribly stinky. It's flimsy and about 90% of the time, I find that a box that I taped up the night before has the tape hanging off in the morning. This is the case on new boxes, used boxes, etc. This tape is a major fail and even though I'm not enamored of the 3M tape, it looks like I'll be going back until I find something better."
0," MAJOR FLAW in this device - beware: I just got this phone and it's really slick but there is one very significant design flaw in the Treo 600 that will cost you a ton of money -- BEWARE.It seems if you are on a call and your call-waiting goes off, there is no way to hang up on the first call and switch to the second. You can ONLY HANG UP ON BOTH CALLS! So what happens is if you tell one person you'll get back with them and then flip over to the other call BOTH CALLS CONTINUE TO RACK UP AIR TIME, regardless of whether the other person has hung up!This is a huge design flaw, or maybe it's intentional so you wipe out all your minutes. Whatever the case, I can't figure out how to deal with it except if you have call waiting, you shouldn't answer it, or you should answer both, hang up on both, then call who you want to talk to. This is RIDICULOUS!! BEWARE."
0," Constant, annoying tone/buzz makes it garbage: The power adaptor looks the same as the official one at first glance, but the ""brick"" part weighs much less than the real thing. Obviously this isn't anything inherently wrong with the product, except that when plugged in, it makes a constant, clearly audible tone/buzz/hiss. When unplugged from the socket, one can hear a sound similar to a small motor being powered down coming from the ""brick."" Clearly, this is an inferior product, and, for me, unusable. Perhaps if you're less sensitive to higher frequency noises, it won't bother you, but I can't recommend this product over the official adaptor, despite the savings."
1," Invaluable: I have read many books on film making and I find this to be one of the best. The authors interview successful people in the industry to inform you about what you'll be facing both from a production standpoint and a business standpoint (legalities to distribution). If you're interested in film making, get this book. I learned more from this book than three years working in the industry."
1, Simply beautiful: The only word I have to describe this CD is beautiful! I disconnect from the real world every time I listen to it. Ron is an magnificent poem interpreter.
0," Works OK, until it doesn't.: SpectronIQ has a 90 day warranty. How bad would your electronics have to be to break within 90 days? My DVD player lasted about 5 months of light use, then the battery bulged and would not stay in the unit. Look at the companies web site before you buy. To me, it seems they are counting on making money off the people who will buy non-name brand because it is super cheap. In the case of this company, I would say definitely think twice."
1," Two Parter Episodes: I remember that Law & Order sometimes had episodes that crossed over to the TV show, Homicide: Life on the Street. Can anyone tell me if these two part episodes are included in Law and Order: The Complete Series?"
0," WARNING!! Will not install after removing Norton 06 Internet Security: WARNING!! This was the worst experience ever have upgrading software from the same co. I have Norton Ghost, Partition Magic, and 06 Internet Security on my laptop. After instructed to remove 06 IS, I installed the 07 Antivirus. After finish, I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the produce will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I went back to the support site and was told to remove the old IS and upgrade to a new LiveUpdate first. I did so and reinstalled Antivirus. STILL GOT THE SAME @#$%^ ERROR! I called support and waited 30 mins. Finally was told I needed to pay $29 fee for live help. I returned the product and vow to never buy from Symantec again. I purchased CA Internet Security and installed without any problem."
1," Titans: As compelling as it is informative. These Titans of Enterprise inspire, fascinate, and fire the imagination."
1," LOVED IT: Wow, this was FUN!! It's been about 12 years since I first became obsessed with DBZ (back when it was either that or Sailor Moon). This game was just ridiculously fun and it's great when you want to pound things.My favorite is the training mode where you can be Gohan and Goku can train you. It's not long (it's only one move to learn then), but it made me really happy to be someone's son (long story)."
0," pure garbage: like one reviewer said...""Taylor Lautner can't carry a movie any more than Abigail Breslin can carry a refrigerator."" Save your money."
0," Piece of junk: When it worked, it was OK -- decent picture/sound and small profile. But most of the time it wouldn't play disks, or it would freeze in the middle of them; all kinds of playback problems. I eventually stopped using it altogether and it's collecting dust in my closet. I would feel too bad trying to pass it off to someone else so I should probably just throw it away."
1, fleur-de-lys & fleurs-de-lis: This disc awoke me up to fascinations of Brahms.I am charmed with the music of their true feeling.There are rings of adoration in strings.I listen to their sounds of strings as though they are drawing outline oflilies' petals. Their beautiful lilies make me forget myself.They have any amount of abilities and sensibilities !
0," Format problems: Beware - while this will play on a DVD video player, it will not play on a DVD audio player. Labeling this an ""extended audio disc"" is rather misleading for the general public."
0," 505's not what they used to be: Levi stopped offering 505's in the colors that they used to. They also offer less sizes then they used to. I have worn 505's for years. 36 waist and 29 inch leg. But now Levi's offers fewer of the color choices in a 36 waist and 29 inch leg. I can't prove it but the material seems lighter to me as well. Unless I want 505's in my size in shades of blue I am out of luck. To summarize, less choice in colors of my size and cheaper lighter materials used."
1," Good Book: I had to read this for my english college course, and I'll admit it was a pretty interesting book. It has all the elements of a great fantasy novel like love, powers, sorcery, fear and hate. Relatively short read(finished in about 2 days), but still manages to tell a great story and provides an interesting look on elements of war through someone living in isolation with great powers. Overall, this is a good book for any fan of fantasy reading."
0," Voice sounds muffled...: I have had this Plantronics Discovery 665 Bluetooth headset for two days and everyone I call tells me I sound very muffled. I can hear them fine, but they cannot understand me. They can hear me, but cannot understand what I am saying most of the time. I am returning this item."
1, Sony Quality the Best: Great charging and fast too. You can't go wrong with the ease and convenience of this product.
1," It's good, I suppose: It's so nutritious, and you get used to the taste after a while, so that doesn't matter that much. Don't get vanilla, that tastes like a cup of nastiness."
0, More like a toy: This Drink mixer broke during the second use. It is made out of plastic and seemed very cheap right out of the box. I do not recommend it at all. The only positive I can say is that id does come with a nice stainless steel container. If only the other parts were made out of something other than plastic......
1," Try Behind the Wheel Spanish Instead: First I tried 'Learn in Your Car Spanish' by Henry Raymond.Next I moved on to 'Conversational Spanish' by Pimsleur. Much slower learning pace. I returned 'Conversational Spanish' because it wasn't challenging enough for me. Still, I gave it a 4 star rating because I feel that the course has merits and is well produced.I finally found the best course last. 'Behind the Wheel Spanish' by Language Dynamics. Amazing method and tons of vocabulary, not to mentiona great book and techniques for learning to use your own sentences.I kept 'Learn in Your Car' and use it sometimes with 'Behind the Wheel Spanish' which I use, enjoy and benefit from most."
0," Not worth it: I bought this book but the other Chic Simple wardrobe books are better. This edition outlines too many things to be of much use: fashion trends over the eyars, clothes for sports, women, men and children. Unfocused."
1," A ""MUST HAVE"" BLUES GUITAR ALBUM!!: This is a ""must have"" album for blues guitar fans or anyone who loves really great music - the guitar work is just spectacular! As an added bonus, Billy's songwriting is advanced and quite compelling, well beyond the typical 1 - 4 - 5 chord changes. This also requires a lot more of a vocalist and Thompson is up to that challenge as well. It all comes back to the guitar playing though, and every song is an opportunity for Thompson to display his considerable talent and marvelous tone. Frankly, I would have preferred a hotter, more compressed mix on the drums and the mastering doesn't measure up to the songwriting, singing and guitar work, but i still give it five stars without any hesitation!!!"
0," Non-dripping danger: I bought this at a pet store. I wish we had just waiting and purchased a bottle on amazon because we would have seen all these awful reviews. We had the same problem that many users had with no water dripping out. The dangerous part is that it drips at first, so even testing it after filling isn't a guarantee that you'll catch the problem. I read many reviews online looking for a solution to the no-drip problem, including testing it at various levels of fullness, but nothing worked. One review suggested removing an inner gray seal, but that nothing like that exists on my model so I really have no idea what they're talking about.The bottle is sturdily built and includes two types of attachments -- wire hanger and spring -- which is why I'm giving it 2 stars, but ultimately this bottle is a danger to your pets, so please buy something else."
0," Where has Brookner been for the last century?: While I have enjoyed many of her books, this was astonishingly poorly written and sappy. She cannot decide which of her unattractive, uninteresting, self-absorbed characters to concentrate on. She is writing about modern people in present-day England, but it may as well be Victorian times; the notion that passionate sex (not true passion) will be punished through the death of the innocent (though obnoxious) spouse of the main character and their unborn child. It all has been done before--long, long before, when it would have fit the age--and much more competently. I will be wary of my next book by Ms. Brookner."
1," For Fashionistas Who Like to Travel: Mrs. Kennedy Goes Abroad is an adorable little book filled with colorful Fauvist-like illustrations. Anyone who likes Laura Stoddart's simple-chic illustrations for Kate Spade will probably enjoy it. Fans of the recent exhibition at the Met that highlighted Jackie's White House clothes may appreciate it too. The commentary is kept to a minimum and black and white photos from Mrs. Kennedy's travels are included, but the focus is on French artist Duheme's amusing miniature paintings that capture Jackie in all those great pink sleeveless dresses and crisp suits in Paris, India, London and Italy.As a side note: Duheme and Jacqueline Kennedy became friends who shared similar painting styles, and Duheme was invited to Cape Cod to give the First Lady an art lesson."
0," Bedazzled by Bundy.: The author's relationship with Bundy makes the book riveting; it's also its great shortcoming, as we are introduced to Bundy the charming scoundrel, rather than Bundy the monster. Ann Rule states that she would have gone for Bundy herself if she had been younger, or chosen him for her daughter if she had been older. Rule waxes eloquent about Bundy's attributes; he is brilliant, charming, handsome, dazzling, a prince among men, a star in the Republican firmament. Could such a beautiful man be all that bad, really? She was enthralled by him, and it certainly shows. It's a sad fact that we are seduced by outward appearances and charisma, rather than discerning the true character inside. Bundy was foul to the marrow, but he had a smile to die for. And many women did just that."
1," An honest portrayal: I think Jefferson is the American Sphinx. This is a concise quick read that shows Jefferson in all of his glory and problems. It might be a bit too good to him, but it helps one understand the many facets of his life."
1, This is the best CD in the world!: I got this CD for christmas and it hasn't came out of my CD player yet! I can't wait untill they come to concert. If you can only get one cd GET THIS ONE!
1," A wonderful book to give as a gift.: BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN was given to me as a gift. It's a beautiful book with poems by many of the talented poets who live in Marin County, California. The anthologist, C.B. Follett, is a poet and an artist; and she has applied both those qualities to the production of this volume. The book has a luminous jacket and various drawings among its poems. The wonderful, thought-provoking but eminently readable poems float in a sea of white, so one can see and think about each one separately. This makes it an excellent book for people like me who always try to read and do too much. I can open it up anywhere at random and spend either a little or a lot of time with it. In fact I like BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN so much that I've bought several copies and given them away as gifts. ...Susan Terris"
1, Does the Job Well!: Does what it's supposed to do! We add a little water to the wipe warmer when we refill it. We've had it for over 7 months and it's still going strong. Great product.
0, Airsoft rifle: we had this gun for 1 week! bb's jamed gun often. trigger stopped working consistantly and then altogether. hard to reload. worked good for awhile and then just stopped! very unhappy with this product.
1, Great book: Great Book! I got to know a lot of things in a manner which is sure ti keep children occupied.
1, NFL Blitz: I have this video game for the Playstation. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because (this is just a personal thing) I don't like football that much. But if your a football fan I reccomend this game to you. You can chouse from any of the NFL football teams and play a single game or play a season and try to make it to the Super Boul.
0," Amazon ships damaged goods: My rating for the product would be a 5, but since it was damaged by amazon I don't recommend you buy this from them. This kit looks like a lot of fun. The plastic pieces are not terrible. My son is only turning 5 so I think he will dig it. I think for an older kid a higher quality kit would be better. The thing which really disappoints me is that the box of the product was extremely dented. I wouldn't normally care except the ""box"" is the PERFORMANCE TABLE. I don't have time to order a new one for my son's birthday and it is a big deal to give him a magic set this year! Boo Amazon!"
0," useless: I don't understand why this unit has so many good reviews. I set it to 800w and put it in a 15x6 bathroom. Both heat bars were glowing red, but when I checked two hours later, it was still chilly in the bathroom. With my hand two feet in front of the unit, I could barely feel any warmth. If you need heat, there is no point in plugging this thing in."
1," excellent!: I got the cds to listen to in the car, as support for the dvd, and I think the cds are excellent! They augment the dvd nicely, with additional suggestions to the original film commentary. I love them!"
0," Broke after 3 days: After 3 days of playing with it, my son's battery-powered percy died. He left it on while I was giving him a bath. When we finally found Percy, he was tucked away in the corner of our bed. He was hot, so I knew my son had left him on. I replaced the battery. While the light still works, the motor is completely dead. I would not recommend this product."
1, Warm and comfy: High quality shirt fits great and feels great. I will be buying more in the future. Carhartt makes a quality product.
0," Bummer Lyrics: After hearing about this album everywhere, not only did I buy one for myself, but many of my friends. The beat and music is good, but the lyrics are a bummer! More than half the songs are about cheating or leaving a girlfriend. Now I have to call my friends and apologize for sending it to them."
1," Good but not quite great!: While this is a solid metal CD, I have to feel that it is a bit second-rate in comparison to the era's leaders (Metallica, etc.). But that's not to say that this disc is disappointing. This is a good performance with thrash riffing, strong vocals and a tendency to lean toward the epic (as in the two central compositions, 'Anthem to the Estranged' and 'Badlands', both over seven minutes each). As far as late-80s thrash metal goes these fellows had a good grasp of the style, though they also ventured out of it occasionally, with acoustic guitars and such. The only thing that really bothers me about this album is the sub-par production, which is a little murky and unclear. Apart from that, it's a more than decent metal release."
1," Eleni's Afternoon is another smash!: Afternoon, the newest album by Eleni Mandell, is excellent. A+. Anyone who digs great lyrics, attitude, and a torch song feel needs each album in her catalog. Her feel is so organic and real. She writes about lost love, cheating, and the dark side of town. Her live performance is also stunning. She is geniunely nice, modest, and deserves each piece of praise the receives. There are lots of Tom Waits-esque feels rhythmically in her catalog of material, which is great and refreshing. She's the gutsiest female artist I've ever heard. U should hear her too. Afternoon, the newest installment by Eleni Mandell, requires your attention immediately."
0," A fantastic camera...until it stops working: My SureShot 105 provided me with 3 years worth of beautiful photos. Then one day, the camera failed to turn on. The camera was never dropped, shaken, or exposed to moisture, and the battery was new. A camera shop estimated a repair cost of $75.I lamented my camera's short life until I saw the ""made in China"" label on the box."
1," not too bad for the money: Bought this for my son's Gamo Youth rifle. I have one that came on my Gamo Varmint. My son and I wanted to get out and ""plink"" of a night. Unit mounted right up. You'll find the laser windage and elevation set screws sensitive but easy to tune. Be sure to put just a dab of blue thread lock.on the adjusting screws. Light is good illumination to about 75 feet on a pop can.. Laser dot at the same distance on the same object is about the size of a half dollar. This not a long range unit and any pest you shoot couldn't be timid because you'll need to be close.Pros:Cheap night time plinkin' funEasy to mount and adjustCons:Laser pressure switch failed shortly after unit was installed, but was replaced for about four bucks."
1," Read and Go!: This is a GREAT book to quickly learn sign language in order to sign songs or sermons at church. Some of the signs are not quite correct, but they are close enough. This book is very well organized. Add ""The Joy of Signing"" and you'll have all you need to sign in church!"
0," what's that smell?: P.U.! It's this gawdawful book!This book is a crime. Reading it will make you stupider, which may explain the ungrammatical ignorance of most of the positive reviews here."
1," Quality Game Play Experience: This was a good game, sounds and graphics are excellent. Controlling the Taxi is easy. The optional play modes, being able to choose minutes, allows less experienced players to play longer. The only trouble I had, the special moves are not explained very well in the instructions, I had to look elsewhere for an alternate explanation, otherwise I would never have mastered them."
0," Complex, expensive, not sure it even works: I bought two of the no-view, no-touch, at the same time I bought two ""regular"" mouse traps. One of the no-view, no-touch traps was loaded, set and deployed; it is still untouched. I need more regular mouse traps to replace the two that were set and tripped resulting in one dead mouse, and one dead rat."
1, Great Lock Box: This lock box fit our need for a bit smaller but still securable cash box. Price was better than anyone's and they arrived quickly. Thanks!
0, Disc skips and locks up: The first home alone disc locked up at the very best part and then got all skippy. We were all very diappointed and did not trust the other discs in the set
1, One of a kind book for kids who love money!: My son loves to count his bank - so this book is great for him. He loves knowing how much everything in it is worth and reading the text. Originally saw it at a friend's house and searched for it.
1," Yaoi!!!! Love it to pieces!!!!: This is one of the first mangas I ever read (I got it from my friend) and now I'm collecting the series myself because I couldn't get enough. The characters seem so real, and relationship fits together like puzzle pieces. If you are into yaoi, or even if you're not, this is an awesome book/series and I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys anime. The only thing I don't like about the books is that they needed to continue forever or at least until Dee proposed to Ryo and they got married and adopted a kid (which Ryo already has, practically). That is when I would agree that the series needed to come to a close.---Kira"
0," Not a very robust presentation.: Actually, my main comment on this book is that you can learn quite a lot. The examples are so imcomplete and buggy that working them out will really teach you a lot about servlet programming."
1, SALSITAS IN A BIG 12 OZ BAG WOW GREAT: It's about time they have these in the BIG bags. I love them and so do the guys I work with. Hope they keep making them.
0," Product worked as advertised, but careful...: I followed the instructions and within days, the grass grew exactly as pictured on the product page. I have 3 cats and the first cat didn't like it, the second cat did like it, and the third cat loved it. The problem was that the two cats that ate it would throw up shortly after eating it leaving a mess.I tried to limit the amount they'd eat, so their bodies could get used to it, but they never did adapt. I ended up throwing it out because it just wasn't agreeing with their bodies.I would be cautious with this simply because it made my cats sick."
1," One of the best math logic books for kids and adults: I would recommend this book for all parents of children age 7 and up.The logic problems are presented as short and wonderfully written stories, and my children just love to solve them. Great reference book for any math teacher/math team coach as well."
0," Pretend glue: I followed the instructions but found this glue to be not. That is, it didn't hold. Now maybe it works great on waders where there is no torque on the material, but on my Muck boots it lasted for a day and then simply gave it up.Very frustrating."
0," Lost Princess Found: Pretty bad movie.The acting and dances are very good, but the complicated plot of a child princess lost and later found as a street dancer has many holes. Similar story lines are handled much better in other films, especially some European classics.The stunt scenes are lengthened unnecessarily and the movie is too long because of that. Still there is an entertainment value for an audience that likes folk dances."
0," sticky: my carpel pain went away within a couple weeks, but i use XP, probably SP3, and even though i keep the pickup less than 6 inches away, the mouse sticks as you pan around the screen making it incredibly annoying and i am thinking that i need to look for another one before i go crazy."
0," T-Pain's ""Epiphany"" missed its mark: The first time I heard, T-Pain's ""I'm in Love with a Stripper"", I must admit that I was drawn to the song which surprised me. While the lyrics weren't relatable in my world, I think his use of a vocoder (first introduced by Zapp & Roger) reintroduced a sound that I favored from long ago. That being said, I figured I would listen to him only in the confines of my car or club. However, by the time his second album (Epiphany) was released, some really good advertisers convinced me to purchase it.After listening to the album a couple of times, I knew that my purchase was in vain and pointless. The only songs I may play from time to time are: Bartender, Put it Down, and Buy U a Drank. After this hard-learned lesson, T-Pain will remain a radio/club artist in my book."
0," NOT MADE IN THE USA! (as claimed): Item I received is somewhat clearly marked Made in China in small print on the back of the blister pack. It is not shiny anodized aluminum, and while not magnetic, it is obviously painted silver, not nearly as shiny as the photo provided by Amazon. It is also much more flimsy than you might think from the photo, the aluminum is about as thick as a medium quality pie pan. The hinge doesn't fold back 90 degrees, so installing it might be a challenge (to get a screwdriver to properly grip the screws closest to the hinge end.Absolutely would NOT buy again."
1," For The Lady Who Has Everything: House and Garden always offer stunning photography of sumptuous homes and grounds that most of us cannot afford today, but when that happy day comes, we want to be READY.This engagement calendar makes an excellent gift, yet is moderately priced. It is a compliment to the recipient with a nod to her excellent taste and the idea that a well-organized lady such as herself needs to keep track of her many activities and engagements. It also looks nice on her desk.For all the above reasons, you may want to have it for yourself and impress your friends and family."
1," Downliners Sect - 'The Sect' (Repertoire): Superb 24 track reissue of the Downliners Sect 1964 debut platter. Again, 'The Sect' is one of those 'best lp's that you've never heard'. Seriously, this record freaking S-M-O-K-E-S! Tracks that have me spinning this CD more times than I have kept track of are ""One Ugly Child"", ""Our Little Rendezvous"", a Chuck Berry cover (that many think the Yardbirds originally released it) ""Too Much Monkey Business"", ""What's On Your Mind"" (killer harmonica), the rocking ""Easy Rider"", ""Bright Lights"" and the Jerry Reed foot-stomper ""Baby What's Wrong"". Definitely will do plenty for fans of early Stones, Pretty Things, the Action, Skip Bifferty and the Creation. A great choice."
1," Lots of classic songs: I think this is a pretty good DVD, however I am not in any way musically gifted, and found it progressed a little fast for me. I think a person that had an inkling of an ear or had played guitar or banjo before would be well pleased with it. As for me, I will still play it, just for the music, and maybe someday some of it will seep into my arthritic hands."
1," Replacing the old: Works perfectly for marinating meats etc. Has a tight seal and can just ""flip"" over to marinate completely. Had one just like it years ago and used all the time."
1," Love it!: I love this CD. These songs got me through a very hard time in my life, when one of my brothers died unexpectedly as a result of a work accident. I recently have been needing some encouragement, and this album did it for me!"
0," Not 17g of protein: I almost bought this from here because I have free shipping and they were out of the banana ones. Not to knit pick, but beware, Amazon has this item incorrectly labeled as having 17g of protein, it only has 11g of protein. The only NuGo bar with only 2.5g of fat and 17g of protein I'm aware of is the banana chocolate ones (that's pretty incredible protein to fat ratio in a protein bar), and as I write this Amazon does not have that item available."
0," Manufacturing defects !: Would have made a great Christmas present were it not for the manufacturing defects in one of the landing craft (door hinge incompletely formed) and the farm house (badly misaligned walls when assembled). Given the other positive reviews, I have to think this was just an unfortunate manufacturing mishap. Still, it makes me wonder whether the quality control guy at BMC was sleeping that day ! Really ruined the Christmas present for my son... so I'm unlikely to risk trusting their products in the future."
0," sorry, i pass on this one: i'm not sure what others are listening to but this album sucks. the lead singer can't sing and the melodies are terrible. everything on this album spells mediocrity and blandness. all the songs sound the same and there is not one song that will stick in your head when you're done listening....in fact, you'll probably ask yourself why you just wasted your time and money on this album. please, stay away and enjoy your time and money on some other band/album....this is not it. there is so much more out there than this....."
1," Great product.: Bought this over a year ago. Works great, fits right in the glove compartment.I got this to accurately monitor my tire pressures during Autocrosses, and it does that just fine. The only downside is that it could be easier to get in between the spokes of my rims. Sometimes it is a pain to get a good reading at first.Other than that, great price, and a great product. Easy 4-5 stars."
1," Great!: Ordered the book, chose 2day delivery, total cost still less than bookstore. Book is in excellent condition, and I like the way ths online course is set up!!! No regrets, will definitely buy this way again. Thanks so much!!"
1," AMBER ROSE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Amber Rose is a wonderful artist, she made her CD debut in 1997, and the hit song ""Candy Boy"", displays her vocal ability as a young woman and artist. I dare say that her vocals are FAR MORE SUPERIOR THAN JENNIFER PENA'S!!!!!! I purchased it in 1998, and I haven't stopped listening. She not only does tejano but she even throws in some sasy pop tunes with some R&B tunes. Amber Rose is really talented enough and musically endowed in her albulm, and extremely versatile. The albulm has a remake of Cindy Lauper's 80's hit ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"". I would suggest to anyone to buy this CD, you will definitely enjoy it, especially the song, ""Esta Noche"", ""Conversation"", ""My True Love"", I want to list them all but I suggest you treat your self to the pleasure of listing to her angelic voice, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!! The albulm is a must and has the best quality of her musical art. AMBER ROSE YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!"
1, Excellent!: I bought this at a recommendation of a person in charge of a classical music section. I like this CD a lot. I've been listening to it for years. Her passionate delivery really moves me.
0," dsst official test book: I used this book for intro to business dsst. I used it along with 2 other books. This book alone would not have helped me with the test. The test was very hard. I passed it the first time, but I'm not sure I would have with just this book."
0," Guitars on fire: The entire book is about Jello, Jelly, Wooden and Chrome stuff. I have never as many bad taste ugly effects in one place my entire life. There is a BIG difference between knowing a software and knowing about design. We all know how to write but only few of us are writers. the book teaches you how for example how to ad RED flames to a GREEN guitar. Make wooden text. Lots of Jelly buttons and interfaces. I am very dissapointed, go buy a book writen about a designer, about basic principles of graphic design if you are a beginner and stay away from this book, it won't do you any good. Please excuse my English."
0," Waste of money: This horn blows, and not in the way it is supposed to. This is the ""LOW TONE"" version and it sounds really high toned to me. The packaging says this ""FREEWAY BLASTER"" is ""twice as loud as OEM horn"" and ""big rig sound"", a description that made me literally laugh out loud after hearing it. I bought this because the horn on my truck sounded more like the road runner MEEP MEEP and sadly this is only slightly better, and definately no louder. The only reason it got two stars is because it was functional, albeit not as advertised. Pass on this one."
1," I Love This Book!: I have read this book from cover to cover several times and find it informative, funny, inspirational and easy to read. It is a book that I can pick up at anytime, open any chapter and be immediately and completely engaged within the first sentence or two. This is a book that any Clay fan will enjoy."
1, window well picture: Installation was not difficult and the instructions were well written. Works well and enhances the view.
1," Best gate we've found!: Was easy to install -- much better quality than the other baby gates we bought at Babies R Us. In fact I was soooo disappointed with the gates at Babies R Us, I did quite a bit of research --> found the Cardinal website to be very informative, with videos, about how their gates function. I rarely write reviews, but I think these Cardinal gates are much better than other baby gates on the market!Easy for my wife and I to quickly open and close -- with just one finger. This gate is perfect for a high traffic area.Agree with some other reviewers though, you do need longer screws if securing one end into a stud through drywall. I just used a couple drywall screws -- worked great."
1," North Carolina reviewer (""Ev"") reviewed by publisher: No, Rugg's Book is not ""a cross-referenced listing of colleges by category."" It is a listing of ""quality, student-oriented departments.""Input is primarily received from objective sources (secondary school counselors, and college students), not college personnel (like USNWR)who obviously can be biased. Only 12% of America's college departments are noted in Rugg's, giving the student, parent, and counselor an easy start on college lists, as Rugg thins out the loaf of college choices to consider.Barbara RuggOffice ManagerRugg's RecommendationsFallbrook, CA"
1," Good basic clothing: It resembles the classic khaki, but is a different fiber and is tougher, but a bit scratchy at first. It is also full cut and comes in a full range of sizes."
0," Disappointment: I have always enjoyed Patrick in all of his other movies. And I have always wanted to see Patrick and Lisa dance together. How could this movie be bad? Oh it was. The story left a lot to be desired, the acting by the two main characters was so stilted (yes I understand it was meant to be - but no hidden passion even came across), even the dancing between the two - there was no feeling there until the end and even then it was as tho they didn't like each other much. So I guess if the was the intention - it did come across. However all the other dancers were wonderful to watch! That part I loved. I was fasinated with how ill Patrick looks. Raspy voice, gaunt. And what's with the cover picture? Never once did I see her in that outfit!I think the best part of the of the movie was Patrick's song in the credits. I do happen to really like his singing voice."
1," Excellent filter: I am a fan of the Hoya PRO1 filters, having previously purchased a similar one for my Nikon D300S. I recently purchased a Nikon D5100 for my daughter and wanted quality protection for the lenses. This lens does not disappoint. When you consider the quality of optics in Nikon or Canon lenses, you don't want to put cheap glass at the very front of the lens. This filter protects the lens and does not interfere with the picture quality."
1," So many goodies in one goody book...: Mr. Collins' new book is excellent, it contains some of his best poems from his past books and some new poems destined to become all time favorites."
0," Gutted like a fish.: This magazine hasn't been worth a gob of spit since Bob Guccione Jr. was forced out. Since his departure, the entire look of the magazine has changed. The photography, which used to be fantastic, is now sub-par and lifeless--with a cheap, barely trying aesthetic that seems to be everywhere these days (if you're looking for comparisons, think those Calvin Kline TV commercials from about five years back that got them into so much trouble). As far as the bands they now cover, they seem to be taking their queues from MTV (where you can scarcely find a video anymore). And there is so much filler and non-music related material, you might forget that you're reading a MUSIC magazine. Even the record reviews have changed--SPIN is a LOT more generous with the 8, 9, and 10 ratings than they used to be. The focus of their reviews now seems to be moving product--why I have no idea. Bob Guccione Jr. is sorely missed."
0," I gave this DVD to my pet rotweiler, Bully.: This DVD is so much of a bad habit, it made me be lasy all my life so I had to get rid of it before something else happens like me getting face flat down to my own butt.So I hurled the disc into my dogs food bowl & he chewed like it was food.But now my life is back on track thanks to my dog who destroyed the DVD, yay."
0," This book has a beginning and end, but no middle: Many novels have twists and turns, Liars Market by Taylor Smith has maybe one twist and one turn. The plot has an intriguing premise, with three unrelated events tied together. The opening sizzles with a beautiful woman thrown from a balcony in Hong Kong. The chapters also set up the plot quickly, with wife of CIA operations chief Carrie McNeil being interviewed after her husband Drum has disappeared.This novel runs at 370 pages yet the action could have been boiled down to about 100. Nothing really happens. Smith does a good job establishing the few characters there are in this novel, perhaps too good. Many pages ramble on and on about day to day activities of Carrie and her son Jonah and their life. Sure, the ending has some action and few ""twists"". But absolutely nothing happens before that. This book has a beginning and an end but no middle. I recommend this book to no one."
1," Social and racial commentary thru dialogue: Simple is one of those characters you'll never forget. A low class working African-American man of little education but with a lot of common wisdom, he attends the same bar and has discussions with the bartender (ie. the narrator) regarding social and, most important, racial issues during that period in America (the '50s). Somewhat dated now (or that's what we hope), the stories are still enjoyable. What makes it so enjoyable is the great dialogue, which is of such clever wit. From the first line that Simple utters, it defines him: ""If you want to know about my life, don't look at my face, don't look at my hands. Look at my feet and see if you can tell how long I been standing on them."" No wonder Langston Hughes later turned to writing for the theatre. It's a pity he's not around anymore. Most movies today could really use someone like him to craft their dialogue."
0," Old Stock !: I have used this colgne for years. No longer available at local stores I tried the online option. What I received was OLD stock !! There was virtualy no scent left. I should have known better. Don't bother buying this item, great cologne, poor quality shipped to me."
0," The Well Went Dry: A horrific repackaging and rerecording of music that should have stayed in the vaults by a band that should have stuck with the music lessons. If you want to hear ""reel"" Celtic music, stay away from these imposters."
0, Died after 2 Years: Mine died after 2 years. What good is a weather radio if it stops working in a short period of time? Forums such as wxforum.net are full of people complaining that this unit dies prematurely. There is a tornado watch right now in my area and I had to find out by the thunder waking me up.No reason to discuss the features if this thing breaks too soon! GARBAGE!
1," Don't go home without it!: I just bought a house and it may have completely fallen apart if I hadn't had this book. When my ancient solar water heater broke, I brought out the book and found a diagram of the collector. When the sewage backed up, it described the repair procedure. When the rose bushes needed trimming, the fireplace needed cleaning, and the gutters needed flushing the book described how to do it all. In fact, I haven't yet referenced it and not found what I was looking for. The book is very diverse. It covers not only home repairs. It discusses just about everything we do, almost every day. I couldn't find anything comparable at any bookstore or online site and I can't live without it."
1, big brother to be: My husband bought this book for our 2 1/2 yr old for Christmas. He will soon be a big brother and this was the perfect subject matter. He loves the story and illustrations.
1," The Combination Of Dark Chocolate & Cherry Is Just Right: The combination of dark chocolate and cherry is perfect. Nothing artificial, no corn syrup, 120 calories and 4 grams of fiber per serving, so you don't have to feel guilty about eating one! Makes a perfect small dessert or snack. It's on the chewy side so it's not hard to eat."
1," This version has fewer special features: A tiny bit on the cheesy side, but very fun, and often hilarious.Note that this 2006 version of the DVD with the blue cover not including Dave Barry's face is missing several special features that were on the older 2005 release (Amazon's listed release date for it is wrong, I think) with the pink cover including Dave's face. This 2006 version, along with having much more professional-looking DVD menus, may have better picture quality during the film, though -- at least it's easier to read the end credits on this version (and if they re-rendered the movie at higher quality and it took more space, that could explain why many special features were cut)."
0," Boring submarine film, No special effect/computer graphic: This is absolutely a boring film. The submarine is supposed to be made before 1945 but it looks like a product made in 1980! There is NO computer graphic or any special effect in this film. You can see all crews from the beginning to the end very scared of nothing. I say nothing because there is nothing in the sub(no ghost at all). Just another psychological drama(poorly made)! Don't buy its DVD, or it'll be waste of money!"
1," Creative Zen Vision 30 GB Multimedia Player (white): I just love my Multimedia Player. I can play songs, listen to books and store pictures to carry around with me. The screen is big and sharp so you can see pictures very well. I have not tried to play videos on it yet and I have not had any problems so I don't have any complaints."
1," Great, but ...: I'm on my third Keurig B60/B70 brewer. In my environment, they last about one year. That lifetime is not great. The good news is they are warranted for a year, so if it doesn't make it that long, they will replace it. Their customer service is friendly and knowledgeable. But, if yours lasts a little over a year, tough. Why am I on my third? Because they are that good. I hope I don't have to buy another in 13 months, but I probably would. If anyone else comes out with a K-cup brewer, I would be tempted to try it. I was OK with a Senseo, until I switched to k-cups. The only was to brew."
1," Grossology: This is a great book. It uses all the correct terms, shows the child how to say the word, and presents the facts in a fun and easy way for children to understand, not to mention a few giggles to boot! I bought the Grossology and you book also!."
0," 3 Replacements- So Far!!: I bought my battery operated Forerunner in 2004. Since then, I have had the unit replaced a total of 3 times to date because each unit inexplicably stops working after weeks or months of use (I use it for running workouts only). I have not received a reason or response from the company as to why this happens. All the feedback you get is to return the malfunctioning unit for ""repairs."" Inevitably, they send you a brand new one. Of course the company does not cover your own cost to ship the unit each time. It's great technology that works well-when it works. Because of my experience with the unit I would not recommend it to anyone, nor will I purchase another from this company."
0, See through fabric: The problem with the window valance is that the material is not thick enough to prevent even a small amount of light shining through from both sides of what is meant to be a reversable pattern; ie) you can see the music notes and dark blue through the white side with the animals and you can see the animals from the white side on the dark blue side with the music notes. The quality should be improved to prevent this from happening.
0," Disappointing!!!!: I was looking very forward to Arctic Thunder for the PS2 as I love the Arcade game. Unfortunately, Midway did a rush job on this game, and it is rather disappointing.The graphics are choppy, making it hard to figure out what is going on sometimes. It is also hard to figure out which weapon you have, and which enemy you are firing it at.Unfortunately, it appears that Midway did not take their time with this game. It could have been a big hit, instead this one will soon find its way in used game bins everywhere.Save your money for a better game!!"
1," Divine: I have been a fly-fisherman since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. I was never able put down my thoughts on Fly-fishing, in the way I wanted to, or the way it meant the most to me. Norman Maclean explained everything perfectly, right down to the statement. ""If I hook a big one, how the Hell am I going to land it."" I laughed until my sides ached when I read this, and I still smile when I think about it. Thanks for putting my thoughts on paper Mr. Maclean."
1, The #1 book I recommend to all of my clients: I am a doula and childbirth educator. when this book came out I was pregnant with my 2nd daughter. I couldn't wait to pick it up each day to read more beautiful birth stories of women who wanted a better start for their children. Ina May explains so beautifully how the female body works and most importantly the mind body connection. After reading this book it became obvious to me the tremendous power of our bodies and what they're capable of doing. I have a new found sense of confidence because of my abilities as a woman and having given birth at home twice now. Every woman should feel that confident in herself and her body.
0," Horrible bottles, they leak: The bottles leak! When I complained at Avent's website, the response was that I should use some water around the nipple ring so the seal is tight. What kind of design is that? I've had several occasions where the milk leaked as soon it was tilted to go into the baby's mouth. It is very frustrating when you have to open the bottle and try re-sealing it several times while the baby is screaming. Besides the fact, it is annoying when breastmilk goes waste because of the bottle design. For what you pay for the bottles, I had expected better quality. I would definitely not recommend these bottles to any of my friends."
1," Some of Saki's best stories: I'm a big fan of Saki's incredibly dry wit and hilariously snarky upper-class idiots - the characters he describes may be firmly set in their particular British early-20th-century setting, but many of them are universal types who can be found in practically any time and place. This collection has some of my favorites (especially the second story ""Laura"" and ""The Schartz-Metterklume Method"").The lack of a table of contents is annoying but not terrible, and for a free copy of the text it's readable and enjoyable."
1," A New Turn...: After the slightly different #13 (Bad), Fearless 14 and 15 have really given the series a punch. Does anyone know why they changed the cover style? I really like the old one better.. Something that I noticed is that #14 left me with a really happy feeling, as if I had just eaten a really big bar of expensive chocolate. But, after number 15, I just started crying. So sue me, I'm an emotional person, but you've got to admit that it's just so sad! I feel horrible for Ed, and Heather's showing what I consider to be her true colors. (Sorry, and Heather fans ::shudders at the thought::) She seemed a lot more humanized in the last few books. I know, they're just characters, but they seem so real! I love this series, and I hope it keeps going and going and going... (Don't sue me for using your slogan, Energizer..)"
1," A Must Have!: I would highly recommend this book for anyone teaching primary grades, and integrating literacy centers in the classroom. It is perfect for managing reading groups, as well as a great time-management tool. Full of reproducibles, and helpful tips, it's one of the best teacher resources available. :)"
1, Great Disney Songs: If you are a fan of the Disney movies you will love this album. You get not only the modern era songs but also several classic tunes as well.
0," Full of it.: I had hoped this would provide a little lighthearted humor, but instead it just made me all too aware how shallow the author and her ""Girlfriends"" must be. She is full of opinions, herself and not much else."
0," Downer.: Lubricated Goat must have been in a downward spiral here. The songs are mostly mid-tempo and narcotic sounding (but not in a very interesting way). I love this band, but this album features none of the fun or craziness that you'd expect from this band. There are two standout tracks here: 'You Remain Anonymous"" starts the album off relatively strong, and of course ""20th Century Rake"" is a rocker... this being the only track to feature members of the previous line up with Renestair EJ and Martin Bland. The rest of the album drags...This is however, interesting to fans of the band. Because there isn't too much music available from this under-rated band, fans will certainly find something interesting about some of this work.Find these albums first: Lubricated Goat Plays the Devil's Music, Paddock of Love, Schadenfreude, and Psychedelicatessen, (and the two 7"" single they released in the early 90's)."
1," Best Hidden Gem Techno Award: A consistent spin on our CD player (mine and my wife's). For some reason, we've nicknamed this band ""Brushenka""... regardless, I highly recommend picking up this album if you into techno-dance with an edge."
0," I would rather burn my money than use it to buy this printer: I bought this printer because i wasn't looking for extremely high quality, i just wanted something to print out the occasional color print and mostly black ink spreadsheets and documents. it turns out that when one color ink runs out, YOU CAN'T EVEN PRINT IN BLACK INK ONLY!!!!!! Why should i have to spend money on color ink i am not going to use just so i can print stuff in black ink??????????"
1," Incredibly Sturdy: I was really impressed with how sturdy this was, especially for the price. It really is like the ones in the hospital - industrial strength. Assembly was straightforward, although I was glad to have an extra pair of hands. The height range is fantastic, and raising and lowering it is so easy, even with just one hand. I can use it as a sit/stand desk, since I have bad back issues - I'm 6'1"" and it's easily high enough for this without even raising it to the highest level. We also use it as a projector stand since there's no good place to mount one in our room - now, we can watch movies in bed without the projector getting bumped every time you get up or even shift your weight. Also, arrived quickly from Bethman Sales - I am sometimes leery of lesser known sellers, but for this price, I went for it and was not disappointed. They clearly are dedicated to offering quality medical care accessories for a reasonable price, which is nice to see."
1, Brita Slim Pitcher: I had my old Brita pitcher for 13 years. It was time to update to a more slim design. This is perfect for the two of us.
0, not enough: The product could not keep up with the cold tempertures of ND. As soon as the temp dropped to the 20's it was totally ineffective. Very disapointing.
1," the truth of EMS: So far i have read a few chapters of this book and I must say that chuck hits the nail on the head with the legalities and the day to day life of EMS. It is nice to see someone write an honest account of our career. It isn't all glorious all the time, Thanks Chuck"
0," another fan who thinks the remix is sh*t: I bought the cd and couldn't believe that Frank thought he had improved on the original mix.Thankfully, I have a cdr version of the vinyl.If you can find me on the web, you can get a copy from me."
0," Fun facts & mood descriptions in detriment of useful info!: Funny book this one. By reading it, you'll know more fun historic facts and mood descriptions about places along PCH that you'll ever want (or need).On the other hand, it contains NO basic touristic info whatsoever; very few B&W; pics portraying nothing relevant and not a single map (not even those small ones displaying at least the regions the author divides the trip into).I must agree with others, this is a waste of time and money. If you want a not so extensive book about PCH, one that approaches only the basic (but relevant) of what to explore along the way, buyRoad Trip USA Pacific Coast Highwayby Jamie Jensen: A great little book covering most of what you need before taking the road!"

1," My 3-year-old's favorite.: I've been reading this book (an old copy - the one my dad read to me) to my 3-year-old son lately, and I've noticed it has helped open up his vocabulary to a wide array of prepositional phrases.The book focuses on these - ""Down the tree. Over the wall. Under the bridge. Around the lake."" etc. - with words and illustrations. My son had a decent grasp on the concept of prepositions (he understood them when he heard them) - but after a few readings of this book, they've begun showing up in his speech.The book is a fun one. Repeat readings, and my son still laughs at the ending."
0," this was horrible: I guess it's ok since the book at least has a story but omg, it was SOOOO bland. it's like drinking soup but realizing it's just a bowl of plain water with maybe a tad of salt. i didn't finish the book because i was bored out of my mind. i tried SO hard to stay awake and focus on this horrible book, but it didn't last... omg... it's just so horrible"
0," APC BIPOD: I've used this for about 3 months. At first, it seemed to work fine except for secure sites which it did not recognize at all. Then suddenly after 2 weeks of use, it failed to recognize my print. That corresponded to a software upgrade. I had to reinstall the device. Again it worked fine except for secure sites but after a sofware upgrade, I was again locked out and had to install the software again. Just today (7 May 06) another software upgrade killed its recognition capabilities. I'm tossing it out! Only can recommend it if you do not want software upgrades. It is the omnipass software which is the problem!"
1, On my way to recovery: I couldn't stop reading this book and it has helped me tremendously with a new outlook on life and a better understanding.
0," It ain't The Exorcist I know and love: I will never understand why people insist on making sequels. They are NEVER as good as the first one, and they are usually complete bombs. Well, The Exorcist was disgraced with two sequels; unfortunately neither of them were good. The second Exorcist wasn't as bas as this one, but still. Obviously, the only reason sequels for The Exorcist were made were for money purposes. A sequel to The Exorcist is pointless; the story has been told, now leave it alone. I say the same for the 2000 version of The Exorcist. They (William Peter Blatty & William Friedkin) should have left the film alone - it was perfect! The added scenes ruined the pace and didn't fit in at all. I give The Exorcist 3 two stars: one for having the word Exorcist in the title, and two because William Peter Blatty was involved with it."
1," Bottleshock: I live near the Wine Country in Northern Ca, so I enjoyed the panoramic views and various scenes filmed in Napa and Sonoma Counties. The story is interesting though a great deal of poetic license was taken--the main winemaker Michael Grgich was left out of the movie! Anyway, it was still enjoyable. Made me thirsty for some fine wine."
1," The Dore Lectures on Mental Science: Anyone familiar with Thomas Troward has probably read The Edingurgh Lectures. If not, that would be a good starting point, followed by The Dore Lectures. If you want to get a thorough picture of what mental science is about, please take the time to read these two volumns. Be patient and read carefully, as he was writing a century ago and may seem a bit more poetic than today's writingsThe Edinburgh and Dore Lectures on Mental Science. Once you get accustomed to his writing style, these books are quite enjoyable and well laid out. Open your mind and you will learn much. Happy reading!"
1, good value: This product is a nice color and size for the price. The quality of the plastic seems a little cheap so you wouldn't want it to get too banged around but it works well and has both the wind up and solar feature which makes it nice to keep handy in case of an emergency. We get power outages during storms so it is perfect for that and has a decent radio.
1," Alicia'a Thoughts on ""Fly"" by the Dixie Chicks: I think this c.d. has a lot of good songs on it and some are kind of too fast and peppy and need to be turned down a notch. The songs that i like are well actually kind of depressing. They are slow, but they have a nice beat. Some examples of these are ""Without You"", Cold Day in July"", and ""When You Were Mine"". The fast songs are good for when you are in the modd for them. They are very upbeat and happy. A couple examples of these are ""Wide Open Spaces"", There's Your Trouble"", and ""Ready to Run"". So I like most of the songs and sometimes the fast ones. I guess i like the slow songs more because you can listen to them longer and they have a pretty melody. So overall I would definetly recommend this c.d. to anybody.I give it tqo thumbs up, or 4 stars, whichever."
0," Don't buy this toy!: This toy is way too diificult for my EIGHT year old to put together and fold up! I have to do it and it takes me 10 minutes and some colorful language everytime! Get the Stunt City by MicroMachines. We got that one for the 10 year old and it's much better, more fun and totally self contained. The Hummer ranks up there with the worst toys I've ever bought and I have three boys and a lot of experience with choosing toys for them."
0," not maguire's best work: it seems mr. maguire has hit a creative rut, having found a formula and now simply repeating the process for each new novel. oh, well... stick with ""wicked"" or ""confessions of an ugly step sister."""
1," GOT TO HAVE ONE BEFORE TWO: I PREFER TWO, BUT YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING WITHOUT SEEING AND READING THE FIRST."
1," Encouraging: E.W. Bullinger has been dead for almost one hundred years, but his outstanding contributions to biblical scholarship and love for the brethren are as always found in his books, booklets etc. I recommend this publisher as well as The Open Bible Trust, Bible Search Publications, Inc. (which is the US publisher for The Open Bible Trust), and Kregel Classics, when you are beginning to read and enjoy studying the Word of God. Beware of buying another publisher not listed here and who changes what E. W. Bullinger wrote. The Open Bible Trust states in their reprints for this author what alterations they made. The one to beware of doesn't and you will be thinking you are reading E.W. Bullinger but you aren't you are reading what a new author wants to say under his name. E.W. Bullinger's works speak for themselves and every Bible Student stands to be blessed. I bought and read the ""beware of"" publisher's work a few of them and threw them away."
1," Seems to be a good machine: If you don't get the nut tight enough the grind wheel will come loose when you put pressure on it, so it would have been better to have the shaft and nut threaded the other way but other than that I'm happy with the overall quality of the machine."
1," Excellent introduction to Japan!: Recently, I showed this video to my 6th grade world cultures students and they were really captivated by it. I wasn't sure how they would like it, but they loved seeing the crafts and various artists of Japan. The video is great, because it gives you short pictures of different important people and a real overview of all of Japan's amazing talent. My students particularly liked the fighting puppets.It was a BIG hit. I would definitely recommend it. We are watching it again next year without a doubt."
0, Nice but not real: I bought this because well it's a beautiful ring and looks so real. But after a week of wearing it my ring finger turned green. It's not real silver. I still think it's beautiful and the stones like so real but I guess you get what you pay for.
0," Scattered story: Story premise is interesting, prisoners held captive, unable to remember their crimes but needed by their jailers for their products. Unfortunately, the story jumps around different storylines, trying to build suspense. Also disconcerting was a few pages devoted to juvenile ramblings about sex. Totally unwarranted and didn't add to the story. As a woman who enjoys science fiction/fantasy, I didn't find those tidbits necessary."
1," Works with all my devices!: I have recently purchased the Logitech Harmony remote for Xbox 360. Although it took a full hour to program correctly, it now works seamlessly with all my devices. I have replaced four remotes with just this one. The inclusion of the activities button is brilliant. By simply selecting an activity such as ' watch TV' the remote will turn on the TV, select correct input, turn on the sound system, select the correct input and turn on my satellite receiver. Many other activity types can be made such as playing Xbox, watching DVDs or whatever you like. In addition, by clicking power it'll turn off all your devices at once. Fantastic. I would consider this remote or another type of Harmony remote an essential component of any home theater system which requires multiple remotes."
0," 50-50: It appears that after masterfully completing the first half of the story, his editor told him to wrap it up. Wait for a 50% off sale or split the price with a friend and you'll get your money's worth."
1," Good: Some sticky stuff on the cover, but the book came in the promised state. As far as thevquality of the contents of the book, it is fantastic. Top notch spiritual read."
1," Love it!: My daughter has spent hours playing with the gymini. She especially loves the octopus! It's easy to clean, the toys can detach and hook onto a car seat...lots of options! I put our gymini in the pack n' play so that my daughter can't roll around but she has something to play with."
1," Great Book - Bad Title: If you can get by the title, this is a really good book. Follow the instructions and you will catch fish. I refer back to the book all the time."
0," downward slope: Sarah is heading steadily downhill. Her first album, Touch, wasn't that great, but it showed a glimpse of greater things to come. Solace, the second, showed her beginning to really take form in her songwriting, which fully blossomed in Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. FTE is probably one of my absolute favorite albums ever, and I will always love Sarah for it. But Surfacing, the next album, began to show a dilution in her potency, leading us to this album, Afterglow. Pain creates great art, and I don't think Sarah wants for much of anything anymore, leaving the songs on Afterglow as nothing more than what anyone else could have done. If you want to hear Sarah Mclachlan, listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Solace, or her B-Sides. Leave the rest to her radio babies."
0, BE CAREFUL!: This game has been recalled because of problems with the dance mat. That is why it is no longer available from retailers. Nintendo is working on fixing the problem and then will re-release it. Buyer beware!

1," ""Big Chill"" for seniors!: Great movie, great story line, and wonderfully acted. It is the ""Big Chill"" for seniors but is great for all ages!"
0," This book is 192 pages too long.: The book essentially is a convoluted argument to the effect that however one looks, one is ENTITLED to be complimented on his/her(mostly her) appearance. The problem with this approach has been pointed out to the author many, many times but she consistenly rejects such advice. Her health is suffering because of her weight and she consistently denies this, refusing even to discuss it with her doctor. The book is exceedingly tedious to read. One sentence went on for over half a page. I read it through primarily because of the excellent references and statistics that are scatterered throughout the book. If it wasn't for that, I'd have deep six'd it after a few pages. Oh, the Epilogue was good...but hardly worth the 192 pages to get there."
1," Great Blade: Cut through extruded aluminum and 2"" angle like wood. By far, the cleanest and smoothest cut I've ever seen on aluminum. Take it slow and keep it lubricated and it will last a long time. Sure does make a mess though."
1," Simply Beautfiul: When I first heard the song ""Road to Chicago"" while the movie was playing I felt as if I was being transported to another place and time. This feeling made me enjoy the movie even more and the moment I left the theater I bought the soundtrack.In Road to Periditon Thomas Newman has crafted one of the best film scores ever to be composed. As I said before it is simply beautiful. Once you listen to songs such as ""Road to Chicago"", ""Dirty Money"", and ""Road to Perdition"" you will be amazed at how wonderous and powerful music can be.This soundtrack is a must for anyone who enjoys fine music"
1, Great book: this is a very comprehensive text that helps me understand a theory of psoriasis I have not worked with before. I am inspired to adopt much of the recommendations as it makes alot of sense.
0," Here Is...The Johnny Carson Show: Johnny Carson was very young and he stated, that he only been in the business for two years and it showed. I did not enjoy it,because he wasn't funny. I guess time and experience made him hilarious."
0," clone of past movie greats: This film tries to be something thrilling and touching, like Adrian Lynn's Fatal Attraction, and Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, but portrays young Alicia Silverstone as a teenage brat with a bad case of PMS, ultimately making her come off as nothing more than a moster movie cliche'. There is nothing original here when Silverstone torments Elwes with bees and keying his car, but you can't blame Silverstone for what is a bad script altogether. Just as bad as the 50's and 60's horror films about femme fatale's, except those might be alot more fun."
0," Only good for small kids and on flat surfaces.: We bought this stroller for the Summer knowing we would be out for long periods of time and my older children would eventually get tired of walking. Very quickly we found that we were on the grass a lot visiting parks, festivals and fairs etc. This stroller performs very poorly in these conditions, is hard to push and we can only push one child, our 2year old, in these conditions. Even on flat surfaces it is hard to push with 2 children, our 2 and 4 year old, in the stroller. I love the concept, but does not live up to my expectations."
0," A frightening title from a increasingly bizarre author: I first read Wagner 15 years ago and I was concerned even then by his bowing to the false God of pragmatism rather than submit himself to the Bible.I have not read this book, but the title itself is very concerning. Is Wagner seriously asserting that modern-day apostles will arise? And if so, are they identical in function to the apostles of 2000 years ago? If they are, then we have a situation where the Bible can be added to, or at least ignored so that the new apostles can be listened to - apostles who will be able to infallibly interpret the scriptures in their own authoritative manner.Wagner has been sailing close to the wind for some time now, and this book leads me to believe that he may have crossed the line between ""bad teaching"" and ""heresy"". I pray that I am wrong."
0, Not the quality of the last Frontline Plus I ordered off Amazon :-(: I had previously ordered this same product from a different seller & had outstanding results. We're now 2 weeks into the first dose & my dogs are as itchy as ever and seem to be getting worse. I am not pleased.
0," I Thought This Book Was Horrible!!!: I reserved this book from the library curious to see what names were in this book. What I found out was that pretty much every possible name was in this book. Now there are some pretty horrible names out there, but a lot of the names in this book are common names that have been around for a long, long time. Maybe I should lighten up a bit, but I was a tad offended when I read what the author wrote about my name, my husbands name and my daughter's name (we all have pretty common names). The only name he really didn't have anything bad to say about was David which is good for him seeing it is his name and my father since it's his name too. Other than that all of my family and friends' names were knocked."
1," love the sound change: replaced my factory ford speakers with these, the sound differance is amazing compared to factory (still using the factory radio. great product, great sound, easy install."
0," This has to be the WORST book I've ever read!!!!!!!!: For you out there with nothing to do with your day, this book might be one one to pass time. But, if your a college student this book is a total waste of time. I was forced to read it for history class and it like shooting myself in the foot every page. Almost nothing happens for the first 100 pages except we find out that he has three wives and he beats his kids. GREAT, That took 100 pages to say!!"
1," A+ for ease of use: This was easy to use. The smiley face really helps. Don't know if I have achieved the desired result yet, but no complaints about the product."
0," Very disappointed with this workout!: This workout is neither hard nor challenging at all. This is an absolute beginner workout. I have been working out with DVDs for years now and was hoping for something to mix up my routine but this DVD series was a complete waste of money. Plus the instructor is so annoying it is really hard to not put it on mute. She talks too much and explains the moves between the reps far too detailed plus she takes water break all the time. This workout is not hard, I don't know why she needs to drink water all the time. This makes the breaks between the reps far too long. Plus the the people in the DVD, including the instructor, do not seem to be in a great shape. If this is the result of this workout than I'd rather skip this one. If you workout on an intermediate or advanced level then do not get this workout."
0," Not thrilled: My hairdresser told me to purchase this product after I ""self highlited"" and caused extensive damage to my hair. I don't like the feel of this product in my hand. I don't like the way my hair feels when I use it and the smell is not great. I wouldn't buy it again."
1," Great small business printer: I bought this printer about three months ago and have used it for scanning, copying and printing. I have used a number of HP printers for the home and small office in the past. The functionality of this printer would be hard to beat. I have not enountered any software delays, as seems to occur with the lower-priced HP scanners, and the Canon MF4150 allows for easy scanning into PDF format. The print quality is terrific and the pages come out quickly. As other reviewers have said, the printer is quiet and does well in standby mode. I would highly recommend this printer, especially based upon the fact that Dell, HP and others are peddling low quality lasers that only handle printing for $100."
1," Must read for anyone who wants to understand life insurance!: It's a big book for casual reading, but you get more information out of the first chapter than you would get from hours of talking with an agent."
0," DVD doesn't play!!!: Unfortunately I didn't have the time to play this DVD until 6 days after the return policy ended. My DVD player says ""This type of disc can not be played"". I put in another DVD to make sure there was no problem with the DVD player and it played the disc. I was very disappointed because I would have loved the opportunity to do something really wonderful for my animals. Plus - in the present economy - who needs to just kiss off even $15!Added at a later date - I tried to play this in my computer but it didn't work there either. However, Amazon did give me a refund so I didn't waste any money on it."
0, Roget's Super Thesaurus: I purchased this book because I trusted Roget. I was disappointed that is was not very easy to look up a word.
0," What's latin for boring??: Caesar might have been a good general but he's a uniquely boring writer with leaden descriptions of intensely exciting campaigns. The other problem is that it's best to read Roman writers in the original Latin as that way the ""otherness"" of ancient Romans comes across better. Ergo taedet me istius libris. Dabit deus his quoque finem."
1," Love Never Fails: This movie is a beautiful picture of the power of love to heal the broken, whether man or animal. The story includes brief accounts of Buck's relationship with his foster parents, people obviously fostering children because they love them, not because there's money in it. What they were able to do for Buck has now passed to others via Buck's care for people and horses. It's an excellent movie and one worth watching again and again."
1," Good compact but a little slow: I own a cybershot 4.0 and had been waiting to purchase a smaller, more compact Sony camera, but wanted it to be approx. twice the resolution, so decided to buy the DSCT-10, in hopes it would be smaller camera, with bigger screen and faster at getting those quick pics, as many of the newer cameras are now. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. The resolution in prints is excellent, the screen is large and quite nice and with the shake resistant circuitry I don't miss the viewfinder, as I thought I might. The smaller size with built in lense cover/on-off slider switch is nice, and this camera does shoot a little quicker than my 4.0, but not as quick as the larger Cybershots and cameras from other makers. Having said that, I am still happy with purchase."
1," Rock Solid Town: Exciting, dramatic,gripping and believable - this movie shows you around town in a very convincing way. I kept thinking about it for days after seeing it !What a thriller !!"
1, THE BOOM: THE BOOK WAS MY FAVORITE I HAVE READ IT 3 TIMES ALREADY. ADN DID A BOOK REPORT ON IT AND GOT A A+
1, Perfect Granddaughter Watch: This watch will be a Christmas gift for my grand daughter (she's new at telling time thus no digital watch). I am pleased with the number of holes in the well crafted leather band which closes with a buckle. The numbers are clear and the watch face can be lit with a push of the stem. Lovely little watch!
0," ""Murder She Wrote"" In Outer Space: That's probably the best way to sum this one up. It's very well done for a murder mystery, but Battlestar Galactica had much more potential story premises than this. There's nothing bad about it, but nothing great either."
1, Unique Offering: Nothing else like it for sale. Production values good but not excellent. Very credible story-telling. A must see if you are a fan of Vegas or Rat Pack.
1," Amazing cable! Sexually pleasing!!!: I was going to tell everyone what great quality this cable is, but honestly, I never got around to plugging it in. Since getting it, I just can't stop rubbing it all over my hot sweaty body while touching myself. Oh well, it's $500 well spent. Much better than those Real Dolls!"
1," Tracy's review of ""Thanks for Nothing"": I had really enjoyed this book. I had read some of the other books of Madison Finn, but this is nessisarily one of my favorites so far. I would recomend this book for 4th to 5th graders"
0," Awesome aesthetics, horrible narrative: I remember I had seen this movie some years ago... and thinking how cool were things displayed on it. A few days ago, I was talking to my wife about this movie, so we decided to watch it.I could not believe I didn't remember how slow it was, and how mediocre the story was. This is not me being a snob critic, this is my wife and me, deciding wether to just stop watching it. And Zooey Deschanel is in it?! How did I forget that! Had I remembered she was in there, I would have never had the face to even suggest my wife we should watch it."
0," Disappointing: I heard the track ""Lisa Told Me"" on Mojo Magazine's punk sampler CD and was thoroughly impressed. The aforementioned song is a feedback-laden, rhythmic piece of punk perfection! Not pop at all, but definitely musical. I bought the disc based on this single track...and I think I made a mistake. Most of the cuts are full of lead vocals screaming over layers of guitar without a hint of the musicianship displayed on ""Lisa Told Me."""
0, Llewellyn Prints Anything!!!: Another book trying to pass off Wicca as a Celtic Tradition. This author seems to be living in her own fantasy world with her head in the clouds. Anyone out there who is looking for a good introduction to ancient Irish religion this is not it. I swear that so long as I live I will never read another book published by Llewellyn.
0," ........disappointing.........: I saw And One in a show in Cleveland touring with VNV Nation and some other horrible group I didn't catch thier name. But I was impressed with AND ONE and thier stage presence. The music cracked and I was entranced...but sadly, they had sold out of cd's at the show. I had not heard thier music before that night. But the energy caught me off guard!So I sought high and low...and had this import sent in from Finland....and I am disappointed. It all sounds very nice and smooth...and bubble gummy. Where was the edge I heard that night? I now have 3 of thier cd's, and have found a few songs on each I like, but I can't listen to very much..it's just too sweet and poppy...not enough hard edge. The sound is way to close to Erasure, ABC, and Depeche Mode to make me see a personality of thier own. But they had a dynamic one on stage.Maybe it will grow on my....but..."
1," Haunting: I'm not a big reader of fiction, and I'm not particularly articulate, so I'll keep this short. I read this collection some 15 to 20 years ago, and unusually for me, I can still vividly recall many of these stories, and the themes, ideas and worlds they portray. I'd highly recommend them - haunting and thought provoking."
1," I loved it, but...: This is the second one that's died in two years. Granted, I abuse it. I have two carpeted areas that are about 8x10, plus stairs, and we use it instead of a canister vacuum. So probably I shouldn't have expected it to act like a canister. I'm sorry I killed it; it was a terrific little machine for a mini-vacuum!"
1," this book is diffrent from other star wars books: corsuscant has fallen to the enemy. anakin is dead. but whatactually happened to jacen solo? the last we saw he was captured and betrayed by vergere. she has him prisoner and is subjecting him to some of the most interesting tests i have ever seen. thewriter is clever not to let any one test last too long, but makes it interesting enough that you are clamoring for more. these tests will give him some answers that he did not even knowhe was seeking and make him a stronger and better person. if youare looking for fights, family interaction, this is not the bookfor you. it is well written and i cannot wait until destiny's waycomes out."
1," Great little tool for the money: I did not have high expectations for this relatively inexpensive metal detector (I paid more for a toy one for my son last Christmas). But it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I tried it on a pallet from my bandsaw shipment and it easily found all the nails in it. I also had no problems finding countersunk brads in a bookcase that I built. I then put a 3/4"" pine board over a smattering of brads on a worktable and this little gadget found them with no problem. I suspect it probabaly won't be able to detect a brad more than an inch deep. But unless you are looking for well-hidden nails in big beams, this is a nice tool to have for general usage."
0, Political and Dishonest....Book is a Scam: this book is an excellent commentary about politics and I feel (...) is another great place to continue the conversation and political chatter that this book will provoke.
1, Excellent quality. A bit too pricey.: I was happy with the unit received until it developed a horizontal line of dead pixels in the lower half of the screen. I ended up taking it to my local Apple store and they exchanged it with a new one in spite the fact I purchased the original unit from Amazon.This was our first Mac and compared to Windows it's quality was superior. Don't forget to get the externl DVD (SuperDrive). You'll need it if you plan to use BootCamp software to dual boot your MacBook Air from Mac or Windows.
0," Garbage!: Let me first say that we have 3 Emerson Research clocks and we love them. I have had 2 stop working, but purchased new ones. I wanted another, but I can't find them in the stores, now I know why. This clock should be on the correct date and time when plugged in. It wasn't, in fact it was almost 3 months off. The default time zone should be on Eastern, it wasn't. So I tried to change it to the correct time zone, it wouldn't let me. I couldn't change the month or the date. It wouldn't do anything. I am in the process of returning this."
1, Funny: I thought the book was pretty funny. It also provides some thought provoking insight into the future of where we may be heading.
1," Great Definitive Version: I loved this book. For fans of King Arthur,this is where you must start. It is derived from the original manuscript of the 16th century. Even the old english has not been translated! It retains all of the original text. Only dissapointment is that there is not much of an introduction. I only wished that the introduction from the hardcover version was reprinted. It gave a long story of the book itself with lots of notes on the novel. This book should be produced today and put into the major shops. It certainly beats Penguin's translated versions. As I said, for people who want the ORIGINAL, start here!"
0," The book lists items found in Etrusia but gives no analysis: Granted there's not a lot known about the Etrusians; but rather than analyze what's been found about these people and give some insight as to how they lived, why they came to prominence and then why they faded almost into oblivion, the author lists and lists what was found in the tombs. However, you'll find excellent maps of the cities but overall it's laborious to read. The Time-Life series is much more interesting and overall more informative for a non Archeological student. How many times can you say that?"
0, matell is trying too hard.: the bling-bling thing is not working. they look like they just walked out of a strip club. their trying to be like bratz by wearing short skirts and tops. I would give it 0 stars but amazon would only let give it a 1 star. this is NOT good for a six year old. should be 14 and up. thanks for readingG'dayjessica.
0," Art of Segovia-2 CD pack: Art of SegoviaI purchased the CD's in May of 2011. The quality of the recording was very poor--it was impossible to hear the music in any satisfactory way. The 2CD's would ""jam"" and repeat a phrase over and over and over in multiple locations.Amazon Verified Purchase"
1," The Third Twin Ken Follett: The Third Twin was not one of my favorites of Ken Follett. Usually with his books, I never want to put it down. It is still a good read for anyone who like suspense and mystery."
0, Anti Gun: I wish I would have been aware of the serious bias against using a gun for self defensein this book before purchasing.The intuition aspects are decent though long winded.
1, New Facilitators must read!: The Art of Facilitation is a must read for new facilitators or trainers. It is easy to read and offers practical advice and activities for newcomers to the field of facilitation. This is one of the few facilitation books to offer a chapter on facilitating yourself. Not as advanced as other facilitation books (Masterful Facilitation or Facilitator's Guide to Particiapatory Decision Making) but recommend this as part of any facilitator's library of resources.
0," Round Up The Usual Suspects: Just another exercise in intellectual onanism by the right-wing, sticking pins into dolls representing things they don't like, while pretending that Bush didn't lie through his teeth to get us into Iraq, that Cheney isn't a war profiteer, that ""compassionate conservatism"" isn't an oxymoron--It's all a sideshow, meant to distract from the high crimes, misdemeanors, and just plain stupidity of the Dubbya Administration. Nothing you haven't heard before, be you on the left or right. So get some K-Y and get pumped up."
0," Whine, Whine, Whine: This is a book about a whiner with grammar issues. In fact, she whines so much, her book gave me a headache. Her mother hated her, she hated school,she has no friends, her husband beat her, her husband was a criminal...whine whine whine. This could all be fascinating stuff, but because she whines instead of telling a story, it's boring. You just know the reason she has no friends is because no one wants to hear about it all the time.I have no sympathy for this woman. All she did was make bad choices. I can't figure out if the purpose of this book was a bid for sympathy or to complain about Sammy Gravano, who, for all his faults, seemed to find a better writer, as well as editor, for his own book. Her throughts are convoluted, out of sequence and I doubt she's as innocent as tries to appear.Skip this book or get it from the library. Even though I only paid fifty cents, I still feel like I wasted money."
0," Complete garbage: Fooled by Denzel's Academy Award I rented this dismal film. The plot is ridiculous, but worse still the characters are just not credible. Ethan Hawke wants a promotion, and to uphold his lawful values, so much so that he smokes dope and drinks booze within hours of commencing his first shift...he has hardly had time for a proper breakfast, and there he is high on PCP, thanks to Uncle Denzel, whom (for some reason) he still adores. From then on rather than characters there are cliches, including insulting racial stereotypes, nihilistic violence, and repugnantly casual misogyny. An ugly and horrible film. Hollywood has entertained us yet again."
0," Not sure why everyone rates them so high: So, I bought a pair of these after reading all the positive reviews, and I don't really get it. These are middle of the road quality headphones. The padding around the earbuds is of cheap quality and not comfortable. The sound is just very 'meh'.If you're looking for top quality headphones, then look elsewhere."
0," Doesn't even deserve a star...: If you want examples of how to do specific things, this book may be for you (I doubt it), but if you really want to know what the stuff means, don't waste your money. I returned my copy.If you want examples to copy, you don't need a book. There are plenty of sites out there to learn from."
0," don't buy, it's useless: when using the brush, the shovel constantly scratch other parts of the car.bad design."
1, Avid hiker from Chico: This is my second pair of these boots. For me they fit so well and are so comfortable there is literally no break-in period required. They hold up fairly well for lightweight boots but I usually go through a pair of boots in a year anyway.
0," Yikes! The Shrike!: After slogging through six or seven-hundred pages of a story with characters I didn't feel much sympathy for, I expected some kind of payoff and didn't get any. Just the promise of a six or seven-hundred page sequel with no promise of Shrike-like closure. Maybe I shouldn't judge the story from the standpoint of what I wanted out of it. But you know what? Life, as any Shrike will tell you, is way too short, my brothers and sisters. Leave Hyperion where it orbits - in the dusty recess at remote edge of the universe. You'll save a couple of light years of your time."
0," Good grief: It was lucky that this game only cost me $9.99 otherwise I'd have got out my Ping driver and seen if I could hit it as far as I can a Titleist. It took almost 1/2 an hour to load this game from the three CDs. Once I had it loaded, the game proceeded to block my every attempt to play the dogonned thing. I have a pretty high-end system and it insisted that I needed to have OpenGL and/or DirectX v.9 of which I have both. There was almost a 2-hour tug-of-war (battle of the human mind against AI) until I realized that this was a fruitless effort on my part. Despite having the requisite components in my computer, if the AI that drives the program doesn't want to play, then so be it and off goes the jewel case to the back of the closet. I'd love to tell you if this is a good game or a lousy game but, since I couldn't even get the driver in the cab, I am none the wiser."
0," POOR!: How could anyone in their right mind pay to see this. They should stop the sale of this dvd immediately! This movie makes no sense. These kids are running around in circles in this cave, Eddie Furlong is screeching at his friends. The lights in the cave flicker and go out in one scene, and it's complete darkness, at other times there is still light and shadows. When the girl gets cut in half, she is obviously buried in the dirt as you can see the ground moving. Another character, Wes gets sucked into the ground and comes out on the level below. He goes from wearing a backpack, to no backpack, and then it is back on again. Very poor acting and dialogue, as well as not so special effects.Don't waste your time, not even a good film to watch and make fun of, it's just that bad."
1, Very fun!: This is a really cool game! You are a Mudokan named Abe and your trying too save all of the other Mudokans from Soul Storm Brewery. It is fun to play because it's challanging and you have game speak. You can chant to take control of the enemies! You can posses ... and move them to blow up enemies! Overall it is a really cool game and it's worth the money!
0," Case Logic is a flawed design: The sleeves on all Case Logic products have the same flaw. They tend to collect tiny particle of dust, dirt, sand, or whatever that cling to the soft back of the sleeve. These particles in turn serve to scratch your cd's repeatedly over a period of time. There is really no cure to this problem either, except to keep your cd's in their cases. I have ruined about half of my discs so far. Even some brand new ones that get played more repeatedly."
0," Hamilton Beach True Air: Great value with speedy delivery, but unfortunately the product was defective and did not work when plugged in. I was highly satisified with Amazon's refund process, although I would have preferred to take a chance on a replacement rather than a refund."
0," Toxic Smell: This lamp has a toxic smell. I returned it based on this. It smells really bad. I gave it a few days, but smell would not go away.CAUTION: WARRANTY IS NOT 3 YEARS. When you get the box, the paperwork inside box says 1 year. Don't waste your money on this lamp.FYI: This is a pretty big lamp."
0," A good start: When searching for a book to teach about families, I came across ""Love is a Family"" at a local library. I was immediately drawn to the title because it provided exactly the message that I was trying to teach. As I read, the story starts off endearing and touching. Love is a Family unfortunately only includes heterosexual families. I only wish that this story went just a bit further to include all kids of families, where love is what binds you together. The absence of homosexual families was extremely disappointing to me."
0," ipod cassette adapter failed: I purchased two auto ipod cassette adapters. One for myself and one for my wife. Shortly afterwards, they both failed. They wouldn't stay in the cassette deck. I bought two more, one from radio shack and one from circuit city. I've had no problem with either. My first dissapointment from a regular and otherwise happy customer"
0," Shortcomings: People need to be aware that this clock has an internal battery that is not useraccessible. To fix it, you have to send it back to the company for repair. We had about 25 employees and I can imagine the problem going without a clock for 4-5 days with 125 employees. Or you can buy a reconditioned clock and they will give you credit for the bad clock when they receive it. Also, my clock must have been in Office Max's warehouse for over two years according to AcroPrint's records. We had this clock less than 10 months and in service less than 8 months when it malfunctioned."
1," Great Idea Book: As a begining metalsmith student, this book was amazing. Lots of cool ideas without the frou-frou designs of some jewelry books."
1, Another Look At Johnny Wadd!: This movie is a look at the life of John C. Holmes after hisstar had lost it's luster in the world of porn.During the 1970'sand 1980's Holmes was called a legend in the world of porn.Thismovie shows his cocaine addiction and the unflattering state of his life.The star who demanded and got paid top dollar for hisstarring roles in porno movie had become a deadbeat dopehead.Hewas keeping the company of thugs who had a strong desire fornarcotics.This group robs a notorious hoodlum named Eddie Nash.Holmes helps Eddie Nash break into the living quarters of thegroup that committed the killing.Holmes is tried for murder andfound not guilty.He died of aids in 1988.This was an interestingtale on the Wonderland murders.John Holmes was not the king of porn in this movie.The role of hid wife was also well played.Watch this movie.It is very informative.
0, Lasted a couple of weeks.: I strictly complied with all of the application directions and let them dry for well over 24 hours. They began peeling off within two weeks. I suppose that if you don't step on them or use warm water to shower they will last. However doesn't that defeat the purpose of applying them in the first place?
1," Among my favorites.: I find all three Mazzy Star albums to be equally wonderful. ""So Tonight That I May See"" was their most popular, it's the one with ""Fade Into You"". Personally their debut ""She Hangs Brightly"" was always the best to me, but ""Among My Swan"" may change that. This album is so simultaneously morbid yet beautiful, it could almost bring a 33 year old guy to tears. If I had to suggest three albums for dark and rainy days, this would easily be one of them. The back cover photo even has an umbrella on it. I truly enjoy every track here, whether it's ""Rhymes Of An Hour"" or ""Roseblood"", they're all moving. Any or all of their albums I recommend. Hope Sandoval's solo album ""Bavarian Fruit Bread"" is a treasure as well."
0," Not Highly Recommended: This book contained a satisfactory review of American History and multiple practice tests. However, the questions on the practice tests were WAY out of line compared to the actual questions on the test. I took one practice tests that had about 1/4 of the questions on farm and labor history, while there were only about 2 questions about farm and labor history on the actual test. I consistently got about half of the questions right on the practice tests, yet I got a 770 on the actual SAT II. This book needlessly panicked me and there must be a better choice."
0," Just like the old one...almost: This game is just like the old rampage. The only difference I found was that you couldn't continue like you could in the old version which was disappointing but I guess it makes it more of a challenge. If only the cities could look a little different than each other! It is a very simple, straight forward game. No real surprises."
0," come on: This movie was just disgusting, not scary. The plot was weak and predictable, and most of the cast was unintelligent. The acting wasn't too bad, but it certainly wasn't top-notch. I hate how most of these teen slasher movies are all basically the same argo most if not all cast members die at a certain point and the main character is sitting down and drinking champange at the end and of course he doesn't die because then there wouldn't be a movie. Well, if you enjoy watching people die/and or you like the sight of blood and lots of it, then this movie is for you."
1, works great calms and relaxes: My daughter has been taking this when she feels a panic attack rising. it also helps her sleep. one cavet if you drop a capsule stop and search til you find it if you happen to step on it later the smell is awful until it is vacuumed up.
1," lets dance: This is a great cd with nice new sounds or like other people call it ''future disco''.I love all the songs but my favorites are hung up, sorry, get together, jump and forbidden love. All the songs have great beat and they make u wanna dance all day long specially hung up and jump. If you are a Madonna fan this cd is for you, and if you are not a fan and you are looking for new dance music with fresh new sounds I recomend this cd to you."
1," Castle Waiting is wonderful!: I have been a fan of Castle Waiting and Linda Medley for years. I was so excited to see this compilation. She is an amazing storyteller with very lovable characters. She has a wonderful wit and sense of humor in her storytelling. Two-thirds of this collection are previously published graphic novels, The Brambley Hedge and The Lucky Road. I was a little disapointed that there was not more ""new"" material in this collection. However the last third is a wonderful story involving Sister Peace a nun with a most unusual order. Sister Peace's story is so fun and a beautiful tribute to friendship and rebellious women that it is worth the price of the whole book just for this story line. I hope others who enjoy this book know that the story continues and you can buy more Castle Waiting from the publisher."
0," HELP!: Yup, Retro-bit. I don't care. plug it in the USB port, nothing pops up on my computer... I have Mac. How do I get my computer to recognize that the thing is plugged in? No directions... NO CLUE HOW TO USE IT. HELP!"
0," Bought this one as well: We bought both of these hip hop videos, they were so old school and out dated that it got more depressing to watch as the DVD played on."
0," Disturbed=poop: I'm sorry but I can't stand this band I tried to give them a chance and listened to both albums. I'd rather listen to William Hung (the asian dude that was rejected by american idol)even he's more intertaining! If I ever met David in person I drop something alot bigger than a plate on his ass, like a semi!"
0," Digitial copy is a joke: Don't buy if you want to watch with iTunes, this digital copy is some new fangles UltraViolet digital copy...whatever. I'll have to burn the DVD to my iTunes library."
0," Wearisome.: Noting Hobsbawm having been cited frequently in numerous leftist works read over the years, I duly anticipated perusing ""REVOLUTIONARIES""--only to have same-said anticipation crushed but a few essays into this collection (the essays having been penned in the 1960's and early 1970's). Hobsbawn astounds via his amazing alchemisation of inherently dynamic, human, and inspiring subject matters (e.g., essays entitled, ""May 1968,"" ""Intellectuals and the Class Struggle,"" etc.) into dry, tedious, bloodless ""old school"" academic insipidity! By the fourth or fifth essay--referencing Italian Communism--I was compelled to put my first (and last) Hobsbawm down.Ultimately, with such a wealth of well-written, informative and vibrant books, articles, etc., relative to the material ""REVOLUTIONARIES"" covers readily available, Hobsbawm's work is not commended."
0," Beware: this product may explode!: A week ago, I would have given this product a 4 or 5 star rating. Since then, it exploded, sending glass shrapnel all over my kitchen.Until I sat down and googled ""pyrex explosion"" I didn't realize this is not an uncommon occurence. I used this dish for years. It's versatile, shows off food, and is simple to clean. However, you might consider investing in some safety glasses because it can explode like a bomb with no warning whatsoever."
1," We are dreaming!: THis is a lovely romance. Traumatized by something that happened earlier in her life, Catherine St. Clair is sure she'll never be happy again. That's before Dominick D'Angelo enters her life. As their relationship progresses, Cat discovers something terrible about the man she's come to love and wonders if she'll ever be happy again. A must read!"
1, Panasonic ES4026NC Mens Electric Recharg Shaver Good: Does pretty good for me. Heavy beard. Charge duration good. Fairly close and smooth shave when blade not needed. Fairly quite. Shape and feel good. Motor speed good. Neck and chin a little extra work needed. Trimmer acceptable. Better quality than Remington. Cost less $ than Braun. Rather have a cord charge than a mounting base charger. Good value for the money.
1," Interesting and Creative!: I really liked this book! Thanks to this book, I feel I have a better insight into myself as well as the things going on around me. It has many very creative ideas about how to understand human nature and consciousness. Although it could be organized a little better, it is written with great enthusiasm and heartfelt sincerity. The book is neither complex nor does it use big words to impress people who like to intellectualize for the sake of intellectualizing. Maybe that's why some of these other reviewers don't seem to appreciate it as much. In the author's newer book called the ""Ever-Transcending Spirit"", it seems like the ideas and how they relate to each other are clearer in the author's mind. This is very noticeable from the way it is organized. It is much better organized and trimmed to only include the essentials. It has no mind-wandering like in this book. Though this book is good, I'd recommend the ""Ever-Transcending Spirit"" even more."
1, UNBEATABLE in my opinion: This machine does the job without question and is a bargain to boot if you do not have animals. How so?? Because it comes with the Low-reach attachment but not the mini-brush which would basically be used with animals. Why pay for what you don't need.<br />The Telescopic Wand on this new model is a big improvement as it is easier and quicker to use than the reversible wand on the DC07.<br />Only negative might be the cord which is not retractable. Oh well nothings perfect.
0," Great playlist, bad quality: I am very disappointed in this product. First of all, the music is very high-pitched. Second, Bob does not sound like himself at all. Third, on some of the tracks you can barely hear him singing. We will just have to wait until it is released on the Tuff Gong/Island label. Save your money!"
0," buyer beware: Watch out.This product is NOT COMPATIBLE with north americandvd players.It is ONLY suitable for region 2.Even if it is advertised on a north american website (U.S/CANADA),some not so bright individual ""forgot"" to have it encoded for region 1 for export purposes.You will waste time and money and end up with a useless productunable to enjoy it,and in this case also review it.All you will get is a ERROR display on your dvd player.Hopefully some day this otherwise fine war movie will be available locally in region 1 format,then maybe i'll be able to review it."
1," long time coming: I enjoyed the book and am reading the second in the series, will read the third when I finish this one."
1," So far so good!: It seems to be working great, be sure to read the directions! It is kind of loud, but I'm using it for my bedroom and the white noise doesn't bother me. Haven't tried to turn on the ionizer because of the warnings it has for people with asthma/breathing problems, but I'll have to do some more research because that's the first time I've read that... may be in rare cases, or so if such a problem does occur they can't be sued. Been using it for a week about 12 hours a day and I'm satisfied, noticed a reduction of dust in the air.Update: It provided a service light, so I removed the filter and cleaned it but the light remains... it still runs but I am going to take another look at the instruction manual."
0," Not Very Good Watch: Pros: Easy-to-read analog timeNice featuresNice strapVery toughCons: VERY hard to read at nightTeeny screen that displas the featuresHard to use features at nightVERY VERY VERY hard to set hands -took me 3 months to figure out how-Bad customer service at CasioNot very good lookingBottom Line: Okay watch, but bad design"
1," Great purchase!: Excellent quality, very spacious and colourful design! In addition, it arrived on time in the right place. Just what we expected. My daughter loved it!!"
1," Too Long but heartbreaking: Peter Jackson could have told this story in less than 3 hours and there are certainly scenes that go too long, but some scenes are so heartbreaking and so beautiful that you are happy that he let you in for the whole thing. I'm talking about the scenes where Naomi Watts and King Kong are alone together - both on Skull Island and in Central Park - which just make up for the rest of the movie. Sure Adrian Brody and Jack Black are great (especially towards the end when Jack Black is in full Orson Welles mode) but this is Naomi Watts' movie.Also props for giving Andy Serkis a human character as well as the Kong movement. Now I wish that Peter Jackson would cast Serkis as MacBeth with Kate Winslet as Lady MacBeth and Vigo Mortensson as MacDuff - well one can hope."
0," I much needed VMU.: I used to play my Dreamcast all the time. However when I lost my VMU, I though I would never be able to play it again. However when I found this one on amazon. I was quite pleased. I look forward to playing my Dreamcast again in the future. It arrived before the expected date and I look forward to doing business with this seller in the future."
1," College text excellent for high school--esp. honors & AP: This college text is an excellent text on writing--and reading. Based on the University of Colorado--Boulder's writing program, it is a clear , no nonsense approach to argumentative writing, the best way to teach writing in/for any context other than creative writing. Am high school teacher who uses the text for junior honors. students."
0," Bad Product AND Service: Mine lasted for about 18 months before H03 reared its head. Took it to my local customer 'service' center where it was examined by a man who apparently knew nothing about this error code, or indeed the player, at all. Best he could offer was some comment about 18 months being the average life for such a product. Outrageous! And, then waffled on about there being no power coming from the battery, which is clearly untrue before finishing up with some useful advice about buying a new one. It was at this point I picked up my 'dead' player and left. I'll be trying the tips on this page but if I do have to buy a new player it certainly won't be from Panasonic. Oh, and their wireless 'surround' headphones are useless as well!"
1," Touching and memory invoking: This is a movie that I highly recommend to those dealing with coming out and with family issues. It is the story of a gay youth who discovers who he really is in spite of men who use him for sex when he is a virgin. The ending thankfully uplifts what was beginning to be a bummer. Great acting, love the cast."
0," BLANK DISC IN PACKAGE!!: Package arrived on time, however, there is NO music on disc!! When I went to play it this morning, the disc is blank.Dissappointing as this was for Christmas gathering."
1, It lowered my blood pressure sometimes.: At the doctors office I had a blood pressure reading on 12/05/05 of 148/82 and on 1/05/06 of 167/80. I started using Resperate on July 2006 at least 3 times a week. I have gotten as low as 125/75 but in the morning it can go to 160/88. I jog 3 miles everyday and use statins and a blood pressure lowering drug. I am 67 years old.Martin
0," BAH HUMBUG!!!: If this is a Christmas CD I cry ""Bah Humbug"" because most of the tunes here are pop rejects. Only the cover on the CD looks like Christmas.....because whats inside is definitely just more of Reba's bubblegum pop that most people like so well now."
1, Nice but stickers tend to come off: Nice hammer. But the D on the hammer head is a sticker and is peeling off. Otherwise a nicely weighted hammer and conversation piece.
0," Good transfer, terrible movie: Good PQ and a solid transfer cannot save this movie. By far one of the worst movies on Blu ray, utter garbage. Terrible acting and some of the worst action I have ever seen in a action movie. Story is lacking and somewhat confusing. Blu ray can't save this films many flaws!"
0," Glad I only paid a buck for this at a garage sale.: Ordinarily, I enjoy suspending disbelief for the sake of diversion when I read these thrillers, but for the most part it wasn't worth it. There was a lot of inane details that ultimately didn't mean much and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the use of cryptologic references that alluded to Jefferson and the Masons was really just a cheap trick that led nowhere. This was my first Meltzer, and I sure hope that his other stuff is better. Of course, my appreciation of it may have been negatively influenced because it was sandwiched by 1776 and the World is Flat."
1," Terrific young adult book!!!!: If you enjoyed books like ""Hatchet"" --- then you'll truly enjoy ""Between a Rock & a Hard Place."" I'm 31 years old & read it after my kids were done with it --- couldn't put it down!"
1, My daughter loved it.: We bought this for my daughter when she was 3. We played it over and over again because it was simple to play and very educational.
0," simply awful: It's hard to add to the reviews already there, but I want to do my part to drive down the average :). This thing is awful. Static electricity causes the grounds to spray all over the kitchen. It clogs. And it hardly works for espresso. Stay away!"
1," Best single so far!!!: ""In the End"" is my favorite song from the Hybrid Theory album. I've listened to this album over and over again, yet I never get bored. Especially not with this song. It's a very nice song, I find the meaning behind the lyrics is very true... it's just awesome... its like they're sayin that as hard as we try in life, everything wont matter in the end when we leave this world... that is if we look partly on the chorus. Overall, this song is pretty much about break up. Besides the lyrics, the music is also awesome!! It starts with piano tune then in the middle it's like the ""climax"" of the song... and it ends with piano tune... not to mention the video clip, it has really cool settings and stuff!! I just LOVE this song!! Rock on Linkin Park!!!"
0," Ok item: I purchased this item purely because of the price, however I would have to say that after receiving it I understood why it was so cheap, the lid alone didn't fit correctly and as for the overall quality of the pot I would have to say that I wasn't overly impressed. I would stick with Fissler or Anolon far better quality..."
0," Expiration date: 3-6 months: Had the same ""orange light... modem reboots"" issue described by others here. Since they know about this issue (although they won't openly acknowledge it) tech support will be glad to ship you another for $15. (Avoid their wireless USB adaptors too... bluescreen issues with WinXP)."
1, Very informative book for the beginners or the experts!!: This book was packed full of information and wit! I feel that it has covered just about every subject on RV's a person would need to know. Good job Mr. Gracey!
1," Great little blender for making drinks: I've used this blender model for many years now. It does a great job pulverizing ice as it blends. The main con with this model is the noise during use - it is very loud. Cleanup is fast and easy. The stainless steel container keeps drinks chilled. After using this model weekly for several years, the motor did start to die. Since you can only ignore the sounds of a failing motor for so long I researched blenders before buying this model again with no regrets."
0," The first I've put a book down and stopped caring in a long time.: This novel is for self-absorbed pseudo-intellectuals who like to read out in public with the cover facing out. Hannah trades emotion, strong characterization and plot development for flowery, inconsistent writing and not-so-witty asides. Only buy it if you're giving it to someone you don't like."
1, The best Commander Cody album: What a great album. I wore my LP out back in the 70s 80s. I downloaded the MP3s of the whole album for 10 bucks. A great deal in my opinion.
1," Doesn't really teach the alphabet: The title is a bit deceiving. This video doesn't really cover the ABC""s. Pooh looses the pages to a book of poems that Christopher Robin has written about the different characters. In order to get the book in the right order, they must rhyme the last word of the previous poem to the first word of the next poem. They then learn to write the first letter of each of their names. There is, however, a short video that sings the ABC song in the bonus features. If you're looking for a specific ABC teaching aid, I'd look somewhere else, but if you love Pooh, or your little one does, it's still a cute video that has some educational merit."
1," Warm Gloves!: These gloves are comfortable, fit well, and are extremely warm! Great fit especially around the wrists for keeping in the warmth. The only reason I gave these gloves 4 stars was because my hands sweat a lot in them (I've worn them down to about 35 degrees and they've sweat every time), and it takes hours for the sweat to dry out of them. I don't even know if it's possible to have a warm glove that doesn't make you sweat badly or for them to dry out quicker but for me that is what would give them 5 stars.Overall I'm extremely happy with the gloves and they do the most important thing which is keeping my hands warm when it's cold. I will probably be wearing these down to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit and don't ever see my hands getting cold."
0," Waste of time: This book is a waste of time. Written in the style of a junior high student combining internet blogs, there is no serious analysis...just the braying of a discredited felon."
0," NOT an instructional DVD: If you have Ballroom danced for years, and want to get a different point of view, then you may like this. If you are like me, have never really tried ballroom dance, then do not buy!I bought this thinking it would be a great way for my husband and I to get at least some ideas for ballroom dance since, my husband is invited to the officer's ball every year, and we live in a very small town, and we have a 1 year old. I am glad that I popped it in before I had him watch it (which would have been like pulling teeth for him to do) because this was a complete wast of the $10 I paid for it at my local store. there are NO steps taught. only some technice ideas. it is mainly a showing of the 2 dancers doing their own thing."
0, Dont buy: It is slow. It is very slow. Problems in printing color documents. The quality of print outs is terrible.
0," Great story, lousy edition: Having read earlier reviews about the poor editing in this edition I decided to err on the safe side and got it digitally from my local library. The first few chapters were, if not mistake-free, at least readable. However, the further into the book I read, the more glaring and grating the editing (or lack of editing) errors became. The final straw was ""Midman"" when referring to ""Midway."" Don't waste $10 on this edition. Better by far to get your hands on a hard copy. This is a terrific story, thoroughly well-researched and it deserves much better than it's received from these ""publishers."" That they have the nerve to charge for this is hubris. Poorly, poorly done."
1, Amazing recording: The quality of this 1964 recording is amazing. I could hear the resonance/character of the particular piano played by T. Monk in the IT Club each time a piano key is struck. This craft of musicianship and recording engineering must be revived at all cost in the face of today's mindless and tasteless techno music. Long live audiophile recordings!
1," Shane, a classic!: what can you say about Shane. I have wached it several times at the house and on the plane, when flying."
0," Ick!: Not worth the money. This tea sounded delicious, but has very little taste, and what taste there is isn't to my taste."
1," My story ""Bots"" is in this book.: I am delighted this nifty antho is doingso well. My story, ""Bots,"" is included,and is *the first, the very first* fiction ever puiblished about IRC -- originally in 1995 in a small press mag, PUCK, and now angthologized all over. Hey, if you're reading this, check out my other books here at amazon.com! Buy em!"
1," Bought it and it's ridiculously awesome: We bought it a week ago and were nervous because we couldn't find any customer reviews. Not just in theory but in practice it works better than we hoped! We got 12' screen and don't get smaller. We put it next to our pool for dramatic reflection and it's awesome to swim below it and gets a huge reaction from our friends. We were worried blower would be noisy but it's pretty quiet and does not interfere with sound. Resolution is great, and just shy of best sharpest quality. We noted though that the projector does say 'indoor use only'! One complaint is there are no directions to help you set up and cable between speakers is only 2 feet! But we managed and once you get it down only takes minutes to set up or take down and it's super mobile with great quality sound and picture. Soooo cool!!!!!"
0," This is important: First,I don't have this book.I have 'The latvian Gambit a grandmaster view' by Anatoly lein and sid pickard.The publisher is Hays Publishing.For all young players,don't play this opening.1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5?!It is very risky.I am not against whether you want to but the book or not,but the opening is not good."
1," Best Peanut Butter on the Planet: I have tried them ALL - even making my own, which would be the best if I could get fresh organic peanuts. In lieu of that, I've been eating this p.b. for over four years. It's great with anything p.b. goes with, even better all alone on a spoon.Eat and enjoy!"
1," Great resource - 8th ed. is out and the same price.: This book is great; however, the 8th ed. is out. It's missing some specs for Unique powder, but other than that it's perfect."
1," Functional, Inexpensive Neccessity: We've used these for years without problems.They run on batteries(2 AA included) or plug, and produce an annoyingly, loud 85dB siren. The instructions are easy to follow- a no brainer- and it's a no brainer that along with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers we should have these in our homes.They recommend one alarm on every level and every sleeping area. They list the sources of CO, e.g. chimney, garage, furnace of course, heaters, dryer, range and grill.They say they last 7 years, and it let's you know when it's shot. I think, in general, we replace them after about 4-5 years."
0," Funny once: After you listen to this CD once you'll have little desire to do it again. It is ok, but only a one shot deal."
1," Snow chains: Arrived on time. Were used in ice and snow in North Carolina mountains and through the recent snow/ice/sleet storm through Atlanta, allowed us to get to our destinations safely. Installation/removal was fairly easy except you will get dirty doing so, well made except they stretched noticeably after use, hence the 4 stars. No issues with clearance on our Toyota Highlander 4wd hybrid. Certainly worth the price for safety alone."
1, They powdervfree but...: As an auto tech and do-it-yourselfer I have used these gloves for years. It seems this box does have powder in the gloves and they do not seem as thick as they have been in the past. Still thevbestblstex glove on the market and still better than most nitrile gloves.
1," It is helpful: I like it and I love it. Very helpful book to begin with Adobe Photoshop 7I hope the author will continue to write about CS 3,4,5 and 6 books"
1," Great Album: If you are interested enough in Taproot to be reading this review, then you should buy this album, you won't be dissapointed."
0, not user friendly: I have an autistic child that we are trying to teach sign-language as well as the entire family learn. This video is not usere or family friendly the kids lose interest within minutes of it being on so they know the first sign that is displayed and that is it. The quality and age of the video is terrible.
0," Mediocre: The movie shows Saint Francis as a borderline heretic. (He wasn't) It shows a lot of unneeded nudity. The acting is mediocre as is the direction. The English sounds garbled as if speaking with a cockney accent and there is no closed captioning for the hearing impaired. Even so, I doubt any American with perfect hearing could understand the speech in this movie. The movie is not necessarily the tradional story of Saint Francis and at times seems bogged down in tangents. I'm sorry I bought it."
1, The other side of WWII: This was an excellent story of life as a German submarine sailor. They had hard duty. They also had the highest death rate of any group on either side during WWii.
1," The Mustacchioed Man is Back!: Mario 64 meets the Gamecube. If you played Mario 64 and loved collecting the stars and entering different worlds all the time, then you'll love this. It's essentially the same game, new worlds. If you haven't had the chance to play Mario 64 and are wondering if you'll enjoy this, I direct your attention to any of the other detailed reviews listed. However, I highly doubt you'd walk away disappointed after playing this game."
1," This cd is the epitome of what music should be !: Metallica have it all. Harmony, good vocals, and amazing riffs. As far as I'm concerned, as long as there is music around Metallica will rule forever. And the fact that they are soooo sexy doesn't hurt either!"
1," Nice Look, Nice Price!: This mug is very nice. I use it every day. The design is very beautiful and I really like this autoseal function, so you can just ""throw"" the mug in your bag without thinking about that your bag can get wet.The liquid is hot long enough, I start to drink the coffee at around six o clock and the rest at 11, and its still hot.I like it and i can really recomment this mug!"
0," A ""House"" I Couldn't Wait To Leave: I read Henrik Ibsen's ""An Enemy of the People"" in high school, and I remember liking it -- a lot. I finally got around to reading this most celebrated of plays, Ibsen's ""A Doll's House,"" and I was bored, bored, BORED.I read hundreds of plays, for pleasure -- I am not a student, I am not an English teacher, and I am not in or of the theatre -- I just started to love reading plays about a half dozen years ago, and I am trying to make up for lost time.Of the hundreds of plays I've read, this was one of the worst. I know it's considered a masterpiece by ""those in the know,"" but I'm supposed to tell what I think and share MY opinions in this review, and that's what I've just done."
0," Couldn't get through it.....: I never thought I would say this about a PC novel, but I couldn't get through it. I am a Scarpetta girl. I did like the first two in the other series, but the third book, Isle of the Dogs was just boring. I couldn't get through it. I thought the first two books in the Andy Brazil series were amusing. I liked the idea of Andy and Virginia West. Without Virginia in this latest novel, the novel was lacking the humor she adds. The book is lacking in itself. Sadly disappointing that I could not bear to get through it. That never happens to me."
1," great movie: The junction boys is a great movie, Coach Bear Bryant started his coaching career , division 1 , at Texas A&m, before becoming the coach at Alabama and becoming if not the greatest coach of all time in college football , one the greatest. This Movie captures olden day football at its toughest and the obsticles young men used to go through to play football. I suggest this movie to any football person but if you dont know who bear bryant is or understand who he was this movie might not fit your taste."
1," My ""everyday"" carrier.: Great knife for a great price, and shipped fast.. as always! This size knife is the perfect, everyday carrier for me. This knife will be a welcome addition to my SAK collection."
0," Where did the plot go?: I began reading this set of novels after watching HBO season 1 'Game of Thrones'. The idea of a fortified ice wall which kept at bay an evil that isn't really defined was very original in my opinion as was the fantasy world of mainly human characters. The first three books in this series kept my attention because the plot went forward at a slow but steady pace. During this book though, the plot stagnated and many new characters were woven into the story which created way too many threads to maintain my interest since not one of the threads progressed the main plot line introduced in the original novel.I would rate this book a 2 and the series as a whole a 3 with the concept a 5.I am not sure what HBO plans to do with the 'Game of Throne' series because I think all of the good stuff has been used up in season 1. They might get a season 2 out of it if they focus on the War of the 5 Kings, but once they get to the material in this novel...."
1," Magnifico is right: I have never hear of this guy before but I took a chance and well it was a damn good decision. This music is very chill out techno style, it makes for good dancing music (slow dancing that is). This is the kind of stuff you play when there is just you and a beautiful woman alone for the whole evening. :) Beautiful tunes that where put together very well. I m also looking forward to getting his 2003 album."
1, Fast Pace Action: What can I say about this movie... well... I love it.Note it is a foreign movie so you must be able to like foreign films which are very different that typical U.S. films.It is more about action and chase seens than story but I love real stuntwork when I watch a action flick.If your into fast pace action this movie is for you.
0," Parts missing, company hassle...SO FAR...CAN'T USE: After reading reviews, hired a professional to assemble, shipped with 2 rear stabilizers, missing the front one, call Nautilus, lousy triage, send proof of ownership, send serial number, did not say where to find it, manual says on left, nope found it on rear stabilizer, send email or letter with reference number, hired assistance is gone, part won't ship for a week, may make it for Christmas, nothing about over night options. NAUTILUS COULD TAKE A LESSON FROM AMAZON. HASSLE HASSLE HASSLE, NO EMAIL TO HELP ME. STEP UP YOUR SERVICENO SORRY, NO CONCERN FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
1, Good product: This is a good tea at a great price. Will be ordering a larger amount in the future. The only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because i just received an order of Twinings Jasmine green tea and it is amazing!
0," bit of a rip off: This review goes for all the four box sets. I, for one, cannot see the point in all these pointless remixes. Once you have heard the song, fine...what I think would have been better would be to collect a double album of all erasure's B-sides. That would be more comprehensive and interesting, rather than 100 remixes of 'breath of life' for example."
0, Sad Very Sad 3 of 3 sent to me didn't work fully: Sad Very Sad 3 of 3 ATX D915GAVL sent to me didn't work they had issues. Actually I was sent D915GAV not the GAVL mobos as ordered. I ordered a 4th mobo from diffrent vender and the Mobo works great.
1, Loads of Info: WOW. What a find. This book gives you more information than any other source I've found. It's easy to see that this author has done the research. I would recommend this as a great read for anyone thinking about travel to Lake Chapala or certainly if you are thinking of a move to the area.
0," Don't bother: Just bought one on eBay for the low price - you really do get what you pay for.First it would not stay plugged in - I had to hold the plug to the reader to get it to stay. Once I got it to, it would not even work with my CF card - it works with an SD card, but plugging in the CF card makes the whole thing completely undetectable on my computer."
0," Poor Service-Cheaters: It has been told that the book comes with a cd-Rom bu i did not recieve any CD. Cheaters, the time when i placed order i assume that the CD will be sent. I would give them 0 rating they dont deserve one."
0," AWFUL, terrible, how could anyone like this book?: I don't get it, John Grisham puts his name to something and everyone says it is good....This book was nothing. Nothing happenned, I waited 450 pages for something, I am still waiting. I can't remember feeling more empty after finishing a book that I do now.....The only good thing is that I finished this in a few days on the train.....I read everything by Grisham and usually like most things, although, he has not come close to his first 3 novels....This one was NOTHING................don't waste your time.....I look forward to any feedback from people who liked this...."
0," What Do I Do Now?: Purchased these and they DON'T WORK. Have tried many discs from stack and none are recordable. It's not like I can return them since they're open. My computer and burner are capable at burning at 8x speed, but the discs are worthless. So what am I supposed to do with them now? I was robbed!"
0," Nice but poor performance, BUT Amazon is more than excelent: Watch gains 30 minutes or more per day. I will return it.Very nice watch. Sorry for quality control which is zero. I bought it despite the bad reviews. For the good were 70%. The low price does not justify the poor quality performance. If INVICTA improves quality control can be a very successful brand.More than excellent care from Amazon. I will CONTINUE shopping with amazon no doubt despite the poor quality control of Invicta."
1," Should Always Be In Print: I was given this book in 1968 and it remains one of my favorites. Why? Because until very recently it was the only book of poetry written by children that I could find. As a child I loved reading poems written by other children. The language and metaphors sounded real to me, as in ""I hear the drummers strike the sky"" to describe ""Thunder"". I continue to be touched and inspired by the poignant clarity found in the poems of ""Miracles"".""Miracles"" is a wonderful book for anyone who enjoys the poet voice. It should ALWAYS be in print. Children need to know and have such examples of their own muse. And adults need to listen and be reminded of their own."
1," Early Christianity, a serious study: Most Christian professionals have little understanding of what happened after the first half of the first century. This book carries perspective beyond that point to the understanding of the formation the Orthodox Chrtistianity (Western Orthodox). An essential tool for interpreting the New Testament and its developemnt into theologies that form the religion's beginning today. Christianity is not the religion of Jesus. It is the religion that developed about Jesus and this book helps us understand that early period. The interpretation of its impact on us today is up to current individuals."
1, Exactly what I wanted!: I bought this battery as a back up for my XTi. Seems to work at least as well as the original Canon battery. I recently took approximately 1500 photos over the course of a weekend and I couldn't tell a difference when switching back and forth between the two batteries.
1," Mabis 04-228-001 SmartRead Deluxe Automatic Wrist Digital Blood Pressure Monitor: Instructions for use of monitor are clear and simple. Monitor is very easy to use. I have used this monitor at least twice daily since I have gotten it and have had no problems with it. I have checked for accuracy by doing the standard arm type blood pressure readings, and this monitor has maintained its accuracy. I am very pleased with this monitor, and was very pleased with the price, as other monitors of this type usually sell for much more."
0," May be great, but you'll never get it.: Just like kecksburg65, I ordered a subscription back in Dec 03 and 3 months later have received nothing but grief. I submitted a customer service request weeks ago, and got no response. When I got them on the phone, they told me they now expect that nothing will be delivered until at least 6 months after the order date.I don't know if this is just the worst customer service I've ever experienced, or if these guys are just unbelievably bad with units of time. Magazine Express claims they'll get back to you in 5-7 days, well, it's weeks. Amazon's claims delivery in 4-6 weeks.. wrong again.. it's months.At least this gives me an opportunity to learn about reversing charges."
1," Tasty snack mix: I liked the spices in this snack mix - it makes them tasty - they seem to have a lot of sodium, though. The bagel chips have a nice crisp texture, the pita puffs, too - about the only fault I found is the pretzels seem to go stale really fast once the bag is open, if you don't seal it well."
1," Very good value and great website info!: This was my first attempt at hot waxing skis and I'll have to say it was very easy. The instructions provided with the wax were simple and clear, and my snowboarder friend also showed me how. We ski casually about once per week in different snow conditions, and the wax seems to be lasting well after 3 weeks. I read all the reviews here before purchasing, and I believe it lives up to what others have said about a good all around wax for the price."
0," This is NOT plain manuscript paper: I thought I was getting a booklet of plain manuscript paper for my kid's music lessons, but it's not. It's kind of for writing songs and stuff. I don't know that a real musician would use this kind of book, it doesn't lay flat open and it's filled with ""inspirational"" junk that seems unnecessary. I ended up going to Guitar Center and buying a plain book of manuscript paper that serves the purpose better."
1, Works well: This is morereliable than the cheap flower foam based circular pucks you get a must have after you have seasoned your humidor
0," apex of idiocy: well, it figures...the first song released off this album is that completely annoying anthem to moronic lyrics, ""hey baby."" i've been watching (listening at times) as a band that had such great messages like ""just a girl"" has just gone completely downhill. i find it amusing to see members of this band drape themselves in t-shirts of bands like ""madness"" and ""the specials (i think...)"" as if this should immediately translate into some type of street cred and should minimalize the fact that their music just plain sucks. ..."
1, charllot's web: I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE WILBUR IS A RUNT AND FERN TALKS HER DAD INTO LETTING HER KEEP WILBUR AS A PET.THE TEACHER ASKED FURN A QUESTION AND FERN REPLIED WILBUR.THE STUDENTS GIGLLED.THE TEACHER LAGHED TO.WHEN WILBUR GREW UP HE HAD TO LIVE ON A FARM AND WAS THREATEND TO BE EATEN.THANKS TO CHARLOTT'S HIS SPIDER FRIEND HE DIDN'T GET EATEN. WHEN CHARLOTTE LAYED HER EGG SACK SHE DIED THAT WAS THE SAD PART.WHEN CHARLOTTE'S SACK HATCHED ONLY 3 STAYED. THAT'S WHY I GAVE THIS A 5 STAR.
0," Um... I'd rate it garbage: I watched this because it comes up as a recommended film, like a cult classic. Clearly those critics were high when they saw this movie. This movie is absolutely terrible! There are such huge plot holes that you practically have to go into a concussion to understand what's going on. I'm so surprised that Brad Pitt's career didn't go down the pooper 'cause this movie had bad acting and animation all around. It's incredibly cheesy and at times annoying. At least with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the humans felt like they were interacting with the toons and were physically affected by their presence. This film was like watching amateur mimes. Could they have at least looked in the direction of the toons they were interacting with? It's like they decided to just look left of the camera at all times instead of at the fictional character. >_< If they remake this movie, it can only be for the better."
0," Bobby's lil' book of quotes: Sized slightly larger than a double CD set, this is not really a book in a traditional sense, except that it is made of paper and bound between two hard covers. This is an assemblage of black and white photos with random thoughts generated by Dylan on various subjects (Example: ""God is woman. You take it from there."" This is superimposed over a b&w; photo of a naked, anonymous, headless woman tastefully covering her torso with her arms.). The quotes are completely without context, except a context imposed by the book's designer, Grant Scott, via the selection of accompanying photo subjects (Allen Ginsberg, Dylan at various ages, Earth as seen from space, etc.)For hardcore collectors or Dylan worshippers only."
1," The Shy and Shining Kain: This book is a wonderful autobiography of one of Canada's brightest stars. Ms. Kain openly and honestly relays the story of her rise to fame. She is candid and full of humility. Clearly, Ms. Kain is well aware of the alignment of the stars the night she took to the stage in her first principal role and she is as gracious, lovely and endearing today as she was being christened in Ms. Franca's office."
0," nick's review: I just got finished reading this book for my english class. The book was a pritty good one, but i couldnt really relate to it, because its about a girl that dosnt talk at all, and if you read it you will find out why. I couldnt relate to it caus i talk alot, but for the most part it was a good book. My english teacher assined this book to my class, and i dont like when teachers do that because if you dont like the book your not going to read it, but im glad he assined this one because it was an ok book, but not what i suspected."
0," Stop Monkeying Around!: First of all, THIS IS NOT A REVIEW ON THE BEATLES MUSIC!This is how it goes: Back in the sixties, a little kid (Rocky Racoon) just out of his diapers got into daddy's closet and thought it would be fan to mess up BIG TIME!And that it what has happened!After listening to this CD I realized that this is like playing with marbles, they can go in any direction and not make sense and this in NOT how The Beatles intended it in the first place. In the original recording the song were so beautifully crafted and brought joy and love to all of us around the world. Yes, the have the love, inspiration...Listening to this was just a sequence of annoying surprises, pieces Here, There and Everywhere but NONE in the right place. Was this really necessary?The Beatles`s music IS the greatest in the Rock/Pop World. This CD is some else's playtime... NOT WORTHY!"
0," ...AND THEN??? (Y???).: Y que es lo que Televisa desea?... que uno forme su propia conclusion al final o que?? La produccion muy irresponsable porque esta obra queda totalmente inconclusa y parece no preocuparles a pesar de nustros comentarios.Que lastima!Aunque increible el reparto de actores y actuaciones, tanto en lo ficticiocomo los acontecimientos historicos de nuestro Mexico y su independencia."
1," v400/v500: I have the v400 and 2 times in the last year the speaker has gone out...CellOne just unscrews the phone little screws on the screen area of the phone and air dusts it with an air duster safe for electronics...if you're desperate or daring it helps tons, but otherwise i probably wouldnt do it myself..."
1," Scientific Knowledge vs. Bureaucratic Posturing: In No Bone Unturned, Dr. Doug Owsley of the Smithsonian Institute is a scientific forensic anthropologist whose life is turned upside down during his search for the truth. A turf battle rages among bureaucratic agencies as he tries to uncover the origin of the Kennewick man. This real life saga reads like a fictional work and draws the reader into the turmoil and frustration Dr. Owsley and his colleagues suffered in trying to get permission to unravel the mystery of the Kennewick man. Jeff Benedict is a very good writer of non-fiction and I look forward to reading another of his books."
0," Good Idea - Bad Product: Great idea for convenience in loading/unloading a trunk without the big cumbersome hard shell. However, this product needs further development. Locks are terrible."
0," blame the victim: The book is cute, engaging and sweet. My kids loved it. I can't stand it, so I am getting rid of it. It leaves me with the impression that the author believes that people are aggressive because their victims are defensive. Reading the part where the wolves say ""there must be something wrong with our building materials"" after the pig destroys their highly defensive homes makes me incredibly uncomfortable. This is not just saying that you may be able to repel evil with kindness. It is saying evil exists because you resist evil."
1," Exact Replacement: I only needed 2 but the smallest order was 4, so I have 2 spare. They fit my red hour-glass 4-flower style hummingbird feeder perfectly. I have noticed that the sun seems to rot the plastic on these feeders prematurely. I think a shady spot might make the inexpensive parts last longer, and of course bring them in in the winter.Arrived quickly in a padded USPS envelope."
0," Not What It Used to Be: I recently purchased this game for my six and four year olds. I was initially excited only to be disappointed. First the marbles are now made from plastic and fly off the game board when playing. While playing the hippo heads get stuck in the lock position. There isn't anything on the bottom of the game to keep it from sliding around. You have to disassemble the game to put it back in the box for storage. For the price, it is not worth the hassle."
1," Coro has awesome dance mixes that you can really move to!!!: This CD is a wonderful dance compilation. The songs really make you want to move and sing along. Some artists have similar beats throughout their CD, but Coro is not one of those artists. If you enjoy to dance and listening to music that makes you want to move, go out and buy CORO, you won't be sorry!"
1," A great all-in-one!: My two little ones love this (twin 11 month-olds). We received this as a gift when they were 5 months old & I thought I would die, as it is pretty big & we have a small space. The babies loved it- all the sounds, lights, and the toys are so cute- the babies loved to hold them in their hands and inspect every one of them. They seemed to learn to sort & stack pretty quickly after recieving this, have been learning new skills every couple of weeks- all with the help of this one big toy. Yes, it's big, but it also means you don't have to buy 4 toys that do what this ONE will. So sturdy- I will have one baby leaning on this on either side & it won't budge (I'm sure it's capable of slipping, but hasn't happenned yet). WE DID PUT SOME GRIP TAPE ON THE BOTTOM OF IT SO THAT IT WOULDN'T SLIDE AROUND ON THE CARPET OR HARD WOOD- MADE FOR AN ALMOST ACCIDENT-FREE TOY BY DOING THIS. WOULD RECCOMEND TO EVERYONE!"
0," Nothing to write home about: Despite the name recognition of those who sing the praises of this book (they are all in it) I found it nothing special. It seems more like a vehicle to get Harmon's name in lights now that he has left Internet.com and started his own shop.Alot of dated material and I agree with the other reviewer who indicated that this appeared to be rushed to press.Anyone with an idea or concept that is in a position to get VC funding or attention will already know most of what is in this book.Harmon's expertise lies in his analysis of individual stocks, not in providing an ""inside look"" at how to get VC funding. It appears as though it is more a venue for him to drop names, something he has been doing alot of lately.Check it out of the library."
0," You get what you pay for...: No issue with the seller; item was exactly as described and shipped promptly--excellent experience on that front.While my product is not defective, it's not the greatest. The headphones are barely adequate for sound and volume, and the microphone sound quality is bad on speech. The end product sounds closer to an old AM radio than what is considered acceptable nowadays. It works with Skype, and with audacity, but the quality is poor."
0," Shaka Zulu: This movie was terrible. It was a complete waste of my money!I have the original version, which is excellent. I purchased this DVD because I thought that it would be comparable to the other movie about Shaka Zulu."
1," one God, one truth: A unique, personal way to present the truth and facts without condemnation; it shows love and compassion for those who haven't heard the ""good news"".It was cleverly done. Sharon W.Palm Desert, CA"
1, The best!: This was my first Lightwave book. Big and full of heavy weight tutorials for a beginner.It's old but it's good.
1, I like it: Nice sturdy rack. Especially like the hooks that hold the bikes in place. Work much better than straps and don't look like they will wear out. My wife also found it pretty easy to get bikes in place and locked down. I recommend it.
0," Not as advertised: Picture shows an 8 pack packaged as a retail blister pack, What I received are 8 loose batteries thrown in a cheap cardboard box. The batteries are marked ""not for retail trade"". I wonder if they are new or used?"
1," Faceless makes me speechless!: This is a smashing new hit for the Godsmack dynasty. The new drummer gives a big hit to the band with his talent. He is much better than the old one. This CD inspires me so much in my whole life with everything the lyrics say. If you haven't gotten this CD yet what are you waiting for!! Go and buy it here or at another store, but just buy this CD NOW!!"
0," Returned it prior to actual use: I received this strap and have decided to return it prior to actually using it. Although it appears well constructed, it is very rigid, wide in the area right at the neck and the inside surface isn't smooth - kind of wrinkled. Seems like it will be uncomfortable. Not well enough padded for the weight of DSLRs. Not worth the risk of not liking it after use for this price."
0," Cho blows: Wow. She sure has a following and I can't tell why. She is almost as unfunny as HENRY Cho and Kathy Griffin, but who can be that bad?"
0," Not Durable: This is a great idea, however there is a durability issue. I've had to return three defective units. If Senco could get this problem fixed, I'd buy the updated version."
1," This CD is cool.: They have done it again. TLC has made another top selling CD. If you don't have this CD, you should go out and buy it. It is a tight CD and TLC has alot of great songs on this CD (FAN-MAIL)!!!!"
1, excellent filter: Did not know a lot about filters. This one is very user friendly. Main thing I would do is put pvc instead of flexable pipe. Buy a fitting that slides in and out so you can take top off later.
1," Love It!: I hated when they stopped selling this in the stores and I checked Amazon and there it was, and cheaper too. I love the scent Shi has, it gives me that fresh scent. It's not over powering as some perfumes that enter the door before you even get there. It is soft, clean, and very feminine, and stays on all day."
1," I'd buy it again: I bought this after noticing that all my nice clothes were either shrinking or getting ruined in the tumble dryer. This clothes rack doesn't take up much space and holds a suitable amount of clothing. You wouldn't get a big load hung up on it, particularly if you had men's shirts to hang, but it's great for smaller items. Looks nice and tidy in chrome, and wasn't too expensive. I'd buy it again."
0, Only 2 stars: Only 2 stars. Almost not worth plugging up. There is no massage power. There is no need for this unit to have 2 speeds. They are both about the same; slow and low. It will take you hours to relieve any tension using this product. The first usage it sounded like it was on it's last leg.
1, Believe the hype: This is the best high fantasy series to come along in 10 years. I have not read two books like this since the first two in the Wheel of Time.While the plot is not quite as deep as Jordan's books the characters are amazing. I can not explain how good the character development/interaction is. You have to read these books. Now. Right now. I'm not kidding.
1," Distinctly American: The Metaphysical Club, while hefty in size, is an amazing piece of scholarship and writing. Menand's book, while nonfiction, reads much like a novel--characters interact as if it were a TV drama--in order to tell the story of the development of the distinctly modern, distinctly American idea of pragmatism. Throughout the book, the key players--Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey--are richly highlighted by their always eccentric, sometimes hilarious contemporaries. Anyone interested in how American pragmatism developed would surely enjoy Menand's excellently-researched and written text."
1," CRISWELL'S CURRENCY SERIES Vol. 1: I am dismayed amazon.com has incorrect info about this book-PLUS they say they have 2 available but I could NOT figure out who or how much! Maybe that's just me...I thought AMAZON.COM was book authority. This is a hardback book, from 1957. CRISWELL'S CURRENCY SERIES Vol 1 CONFEDERATE AND SOUTHERN STATE CURRENCY. Basic book has 277 illustrated pages inside and most I have ever seen have black canvas cover , whilst dustjacket is white with pink on pink outlining with facsimile bills on it, center part is white with blue printing. COPYRIGHT 1957.This also has a gold cardboard covered 1957 PRICE LIST AND SUPPLEMENT Volume 1 which is perhaps what they are indeed describing, the supplement has gold cardboard front/back cover with said 16 pages."
1," Let us now praise Ohio Players: Ahh 70's funk. Earth, Wind and Fire, P-Funk, War, AWB, Slave,and of course, the unmatched musicianship, expressiveness, anda**-shakin' GROOVE of Ohio Players. Sure there's a few tracks I'd like to have from Honey and Fire, but nothing you can't live without, and as for what they DID include on Gold, there's not a clinker here. ""Skin Tight"" is just as good as it gets, did you here that dropped beat at the end of the chorus?! Damn, that's some funky s***! ""Fire"" was like the new national anthem when it came out. I remember tuning that radio dial, with my ear up close, listening for that siren -- SOMEBODY'S got to be playing Fire, cuz I want to hear it right f***ing now! ""Yeaaah unh-huh... FIH-YUH!!""Whew! They don't make bass players and drummers like those guys any more. They don't exist. Horn players? Forget it. And those vocals! That falsetto dude ripped a hole in my speaker. I remember seeing Ohio Players on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Now we got MTV. Sigh... END"
0, i don't recommend this moniter: This moniter makes loud noises in the middle of the night when noone could be using electronics. i have to get up in the middle of the night to turn it off at like 3 am.

0," Swiffer Sucks?: I had been wanting a Swiffer Vac for a long time. I finally ordered one because it was a great price on Amazon. I waited excitedly for it to come in the mail. Upon opening it, I didnt realize that it would be so small. After charging it I decided to give it a test run. Big Disappointment. Although it did a decent job, it didnt ""suck"" like I thought it would. I am glad I got it at a reduced price and not full retail."
1," Prodikeys are..... special =): The product works fine , The sound delay between actually pressing the keys and what actually plays is a bit off, but you get use to it quickly. The Keys are also not full length keys and have a plastic feel to them , so it feels a bit like a toy at first as well. But overall It is a pretty fun keyboard, I am glad I bought it.On the flip side of thisTHIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!The Music portion of the Prodikeys is NOT supported with VISTA. I searched for hours upon hours to find a way to make it work with my vista computer and I never succeeded. So if you are not running a computer with XP(or an earlier OS) or have a computer with XP this product isn't good for you."
0," This book (and the rest of the series) is terrible: I was recommended this book and I was very dissapointed. This book seems like a take off of the baby sitters clud and I HATED those books. I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoy the series, I don't mean to bash it, but I did not like it. It's a too touchy-friendly-lets-make-up-and-kiss kind of book....take my advice and don't bother reading this book or the series."
1," Outstanding Book!: This was a book that was hard to put down. In 1939 a group ofpowerful men are determined to keep America out of a war withHitler and Germany.This group enlists the services of a professional killer to assassinate the King and Queen of Englandwhile they are on a tour of America. This would forvever poisonrelations between America and England.Thomas Barry,a ScotlandYard detective and Jane Todd a photographer are aware of thisconspiracy and are trying to stop it by catching the assassin. The assassin,John Bone is very good at what he does.You have somehistorically significant people come up in this story.Allen Dulles,Joseph Kennedy,Lyndon Johnson,and Frank Sinatra are mentioned in this story. This is a good book that you will enjoy. Buy it and read it."
1," Culturally diverse fiction is Ana Castillo's forte: In this new novel Ana Castillo tells the story of Carmen ""la coja"", a woman with a deteriorated leg that has reached beyond her natural strenghts to become a Flamenco dancer and who gets involved with two interesting characters, allowing the reader a glimpse into a culturally separate reality. Ana Castillo's fiction is a lesson in life as lived by a large part of the population that somehow remains invisible to those that seek to ignore it. Excellent book."
0," Avoid this flimsy thing!: The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first. Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch. These are not cushions with a black cover. This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp. The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint. Don't buy this. Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier."
